"There was an organic salad to be made. There was a photograph of just how to do it, with baby red cabbages and chick peas and garlic that looked just like chick peas and artichoke hearts and celery and other stuff. We had 3 weeks to make it. It was suppose to be organic. Rudy was in charge of the project and had an insulated bag to carry the salad all over the country and to London if necessary. In California there were organic vegetables at every shop--but there was a beach and we wanted to spend our time there. When it was time to leave I couldn't pick my clothes up off the floor. I stayed at the beach house. There were security guards making the rounds. One fixed a big plate of grits and breakfast meat. I was trying to tell him we grew up on grits nearly every day. He was not listening to me. I was talking but nobody would listen. Then it was time to get back to the salad. Rudy came back and we went to Aunt Joe's and Uncle Gene's. Their house was changed into a summer camp for rock and roll kids and the other side for Christian youth. There was a sign out front that was orange. It said, ""Fishing @ 90 m.p.h."" I was confused by the sign. It seemed too fast to be fishing. Uncle Gene had painted a sign and a ""Anderson"" coat of arms on a black board with white paint. The letters were blocky like he made them with masking tape. It made me mad that he took our name for his yard. The crowd was getting bigger to make the salad. Dick was in from London. Lots of hip rock and roll kids talking with Rudy, laughing, getting lost in his stories. The Christian campers had started moving in on the other side of the house. They were--each group--trying to sing their music louder. A lady, a boy's mother from the Christian group, was next to me, working out on the weights. When she yelled, ""sliders,"" a guy with big, black army boots would slide down the pulley and kick me. I asked her what they were doing. She said if I was not gonna listen about god they were gonna beat it in to me. I was getting sunburned. Very sunburned. My hair was getting white from the sun. I was waiting.",Negative
"Capt. P., the battalion surgeon, places a slender nylon noose around my neck. Attached to it is a loaded .45 automatic. He tells me to shoot myself. I can feel the fear turning into the necessity to resist. I will kill him instead. I probe the bottom of the grip; there is no magazine. From somewhere I obtain a .38 and shoot him in the head. However, recollection is unclear at this point, and this may or may not be the case.",Negative
"I'm not sure exactly where I was. I think I was on a mountain or something. But I told this girl that I've had a crush on for a while, that I'd like her and she said that she liked me too. So we got to know each other better and started going out. We got along great and we went out forever. Then I woke up.",Negative
"Mirabelle and I are in a church and we start clapping our hands to get the congregation to keep time with us. Then we start singing. It went something like this, ""Lord I need your help now,"" and He said, ""Just pray to me."" I said, ""I can do that Lord, I can do that, because I have God, and God has me."" Then we'd sing another verse and repeat the chorus. The audience would clap with us at first and then quiet up to hear the words of the verse.",Positive
"I dreamed I met an old friend, Phil Lancione, from undergraduate school whom I haven't seen in a long time. We were out driving around town in his red Alfa Romeo. He let me drive and I was driving around where he wanted to show me how it cornered. I took several corners and he said it would taken them faster. I went around the block to try the corner again. I was shifting well and the car felt good. When we approached the corner, he said I could take it faster. I put the car in second gear and floored the gas. The car seemed to be set up just right for the corner, but as we got in too far to change the course of events, the car accelerated unreasonably fast, even after I took my foot off the gas, and we slid off the street onto a golf course. I backed off the golf course with no harm done.",Positive
"Well, it was like a movie. Me and two guys and another girl (my family?) went to Alcatraz. When we got there we just stood there for a moment feeling the wall. Then we went inside to the office and were looking around when a guy walked in. Then he started talking to us, and I had a bad feeling about him. Somehow we captured him and the guys asked the other girl to slit his scalp. She did and then suddenly he shoved us all away from him and his head was one of an alien. Then he pulled out his gun and started shooting at us. We were chased around for a while, when I tripped right in front of him. He aimed his gun at me and said, ""Now you can't escape me."" I thought he was going to fire, but at the last second he put his gun up and shot at something else. Then he fell over because someone shot him. He looked over at me and said, ""I'm sorry,"" and then he sat up and made some big speech thing and then I woke up. Setting: At Alcatraz, mostly in the office room. Characters: Well, the two guys and one girl that were with me, I have no idea who they were. The bad guy, I don't know him either. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, overwhelmed. Well, I was scared and worried when the guy/alien was chasing us, but I was overwhelmed when we were standing outside touching the wall.",Negative
"I was watching a filming with Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt.  The director asked Helen for more emotions.  They were in a haunted house.  There was a mirror in a hall, in front of one wall.  Helen stopped and looked at it.  She was able to walk through.  As she passed through the invisible passage, only her irises and pupils were visible.  Liquid invisibility shimmered.  She called Paul in too.  It was the bathroom.  I went in.  On the steamed mirror appeared the words, ""Go away.""  Paul typed back over the toilet asking for specificity.  What exactly did it want us away from?  Jargon appeared and we scampered out of there in fear.",Negative
"Faye and Karl at dining table. Karl explains that all landlords figure $5.50 per month for each missing tenant. I remark that this is easily understandable. Karl said we ought to pay off the mortgages and then sell real estate. Asks whether the school hasn't gotten out a better ruler than the defective (or worn out) one he is using, and Faye answers ""Yes, I suppose they have"" in a playful tone. They smile at each other in a knowing way, as at some subtle witticism.",Positive
"We are invited to Brenda's for a Sunday evening get-together; she is vague about the time and does not call to confirm. While we wait, I see Vi Tharaldson (neighbor) walk by like a mailman delivering some flyers. We finally get to Brenda's and I have to go to the bathroom: a very modern and different looking toilet seat, made of wood, with 3 hinges. I shit a large corncob - half eaten! - and it wont flush down... What to do with it??",Negative
"The User Teacher  I'm with others in a group. There is a man about 55-60 years old with grayish white hair and a beard with us. He has a blue Geo Metro that he lives in. He is an outdoors type of person. He takes a paddle and a lump of cotton, and starts pulling and stretching the cotton until there is a washcloth on the paddle. Two regular nails and one two-pronged nail for electrical wiring attach the washcloth to the paddle. This is what the old man has to teach us. We are going to work so we learn how to do this. He wants us to haul 20-30 garbage cans full of water up a sandy hill. The man has a young man as an apprentice. The apprentice shows us how to lift a plastic canoe using a paddle for leverage, like a yoke. He wants or instructs us to use the paddles as levers to haul barrels up the hill. He wants us to fill the barrels with dirt and sand. I grab a 20-gallon garbage can and start walking down a sandy hill. I use a hose to spray some of the sand off my garbage can. As I walk down the hill I want to tell the two guys who are at the top of the hill to fuck off, and to leave their can there. It is going to be so heavy and painful to carry these huge cans of water and sand using a paddle on our neck as a lever! Ouch! Then I realize the old man is a fake. His trick with the cotton and the washcloth was a hoax: there was a washcloth nailed to the paddle in the first place, and all he had to do was rub away some loose cotton that was covering the washcloth up. I explain this to my sister Ramona and her friend Barb Mohs while we're standing on metal bed frames, stood on end, at the bottom of the hill. I won't haul the garbage cans. The man was going to use us to haul his water up the hill.",Negative
"(03/19/00)[""My own house.""] I had been in some institution and now each person gets their own individual house. I go inside mine to see what its like. It is small but lovely. The walls of the living room are almost all glass windows. Hardly any furniture but I like that. A spacious feeling to the house. I walk downstairs and see a large area. It is a tiled floor, blue and white. A very large shower that is wheelchair accessible. Lots of shower heads, maybe four of them. They turn on automatically when I walk into the shower area. I like this. I notice the two showers next to the entrance is spraying water out into the hall area. I try to think them more interior so I don't make a mess. It is difficult. I then turn and walk toward the other end of the room. I see two sleeping areas one for my son and one for my daughter. A third area is for their toys to be kept. I like this house.",Positive
"A man will see to it that I will get the day off and he will take care of the woman I am with so I can get some rest and the woman will get some rest. We're both very happy about that.

"I was in a car race. I was running ahead of everybody so I confidently stopped at a highway restaurant. I had a drink and went out and then I found several of my friends and there were lots of people who hadn't been there when I went in. Everybody was running at the side of the road in order to see the cars go by. I shouted with everybody else and forgot about the race. Several cars went by and then I went into the bar to have a beer. There were several of us, but none of them was familiar. We were drinking to my success in the race. We were drinking a lot and then on the radio we could hear someone screaming, ""Goal!"" A point had been made by my favorite team and I was happy. Then I awoke.",Negative
"I am flying in Terence's plane. I am a little scared that there will be an accident. I am the passenger. First, we fly just fine. Then we get to close to the ground but we can't get higher because of the wires. I am nervous we won't see them and attempt to rise and get caught in them, or hit buildings or cars because we're so low. I cry out, ""Look out for the building!"" And we swing around it, barely missing it. Then the engine stalls. Terence just opens the hood and dinks around in it. He says, ""It's nice we have such a compact little plane. Easier to fix."" We go on.",Negative
"I was in a hardware store when I felt a vibration under my feet.  I thought at first it might be a freight train passing near the store, but then it became too strong for that, and the whole building started shaking.  I asked someone if it was an earthquake, and they said yes.  At first I was going to lie down on the floor and cover my head, but I decided it would be better to run outside and try to get away from the building.  Another person and I got through a back door, but he told me to keep running, because the building was tall enough to fall on us.  I looked up, and sure enough it was like an office building-about five stories high, and all glass.  This guy kept pushing me, and I kept trying to run but was not moving very fast.  I was irritated that he kept pushing me, because I couldn't go any faster.  (At this point, I woke up.  Anita was pushing me to wake me up, and asking me if I was having a nightmare.)",Negative
"Now it's time for our group to perform. I'm sort of not in the group anymore. I've grown beyond their capacities and I'm moving on for more. Brett's in the group. Our audience is small and seated in school desks. Everyone goes up to do the opening song. I come up a little later, on the periphery. They sing and falter, forgetting the words. I sing out ""We forgot the words and it's O.K.,"" to a nursery rhyme tune. The audience loves it and applauds. I go sit on the sidelines while Hector and his girl work out a new skit. I need my scripts. I go back to my purse and get them. I come back up on stage. Maggie sits next to me and says, ""You're really matured. You were good and now you're hot!"" I say, ""Thanks.""",Positive

She had sent him some, pretending to be, saying 'I had a crush on you' etc. One said 'don't worry, I'm still your friend' and something about The Pythons. I found out Mom had also been talking to the members of Monty Python.",Negative
"It was a preposterous one, I know, and the one feature I am sure of was a load of hay, towering to an amazing height from the low massive sledge on which it was drawn slowly along the snow-covered streets of a small village.

"Debbie Oliver  I'm in Carter Church. I sit in back with my friend Niles Zelling. Many others are there and they sit in the front of the church. My grade school classmate Misty Ryan is a server for the mass. The priest is Father Vance Brock. At the end of mass Father Vance asks if anyone wants to stay and serve a funeral. A lot of people raise their hands or jump up, because they'll get out of the rest of the day at Carter School if they serve. I hope I don't get called on. Father Vance selects three people, not me. Then he tells the rest of us ""cocksuckers"" to leave. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor is there. I grab his jacket for him. Outside is it icy: very slippery. Others and I go over to Carter School. We haven't eaten lunch yet, and it's early afternoon. My friends Tiny and Matt Combs, and Jeff and Ryan Vaurnet are there. They're going to Jefferson School to have a fish fry for lunch in a trailer home. I haven't eaten since I've been in church, so I ask them if I can go with if they'll have enough fish. They say I can. I go upstairs to the secretary's office where I find a television and a VCR. I unplug them to go past them, and then plug them back in. I walk down the dark upstairs hallway with a light in my hand. The doors to the classrooms aren't closed tightly. I don't know which grade I'm in. I hear faint voice in my sixth grade teacher Sherry Devine's room. I don't want to interrupt the people, so I go to the bathroom. There is a tiger in the bathroom. It is huge and strong but gentle. There is a dog with antlers tied to its head. There are two cats, one of which is nice and the other mean. The mean cat climbs up my leg and scratches me. I grab it by the back of the neck and hold it, like I am choking it. I go out of the bathroom and find my name and coat rack underneath it. I'm near the door, I think, because my teachers have always seen me as being responsible enough to be away from the teacher's coat rack. I put the battery charger on my coat rack. The coat rack of an acquaintance of mine named Debbie Oliver is next to mine. Debbie and Sherry Devine walk out of the room. Debbie is starting 6th grade at Carter School. Sherry has some very crisp waffles. She says I can go eat with the others. The others have left.",Negative

I started to walk away and then someone opened the door from the inside and said ""Oh no, we're open, come on in."" So I went in and I couldn't find anything that was familiar to me, the whole place had been rearranged, there was hardware up front and I thought I must be in the wrong store but yet I could smell bread being made and I said to the guy, ""Where's the bread being made?"" And the man said ""You're in a paint store.""

Then something vague about being in the back seat of a car with other people on the way to wherever we were going.  Then I was playing football, either among some dormitories on a college campus or among some apartment buildings.  We weren't really playing a game, just tossing the ball around.  There were numerous trees, and they always seemed to be in the way of long passes I wanted to throw.  The timing had to be perfect in order to have your receiver in the right position to throw to him through openings through the limbs, but the ball was slightly bigger around than ones I am used to, and it kept slipping out of my hand at the moment I was about to throw.  Then, because I couldn't grip it well, I couldn't throw it as far as I knew I could otherwise, and my passes kept falling short.",Positive

I found something that led to me discovering some secret weapon thing which I apparently had. Somehow I confirmed this. I realized people were after it, so I called Mom to let her know and she was away for the weekend. I called her and she said these people had just asked and were asking her questions. I panicked and packed my bag with clothes and books for studying. I was going to go to dads and I had an exam tomorrow. I put my shoes in there too.

I went down the hall and quickly got to the front door -- the door was different as well as the front yard. I locked the door as he got to me through another entrance. We fought and I ended up slashing his throat and he fell to the ground. While he was on the ground, he looked like Ted (How I Met Your Mother) and I thought he was actually hot. His mate came and I ran outside. I had a package and ran to my car and drove off. I ended up going back later and they were gone. I tried to brake, but it wasn't working. I got to where Mom was and Ezra was with her. I didn't know if the key was in properly. Then the car was shrinking because of fear of a lake? Mom asked if anything 'traumatic' had happened today and I said that 'terrorists came after me for a biological weapon' and she was shocked.

They started singing the Mr. Rogers song, but I was the only one who knew all the words. I spotted a wad of cash and I put my foot on it to keep the wind from blowing it away. Next to it was a black plastic bag--thick plastic. It was a bag of loose money. 1's, 5's, 10's. I picked up the bag and joined back in to the Mr. Rogers song. We went back up to the hotel apartment and I had already made a mess. Clothes were everywhere. On the bed post were 2 long old old cut-up t-shirts that had belonged to a very old couple, very much in love, who had to leave quickly. They were long t-shirts faded white, thick cotton with the sleeves cut out. The man's had a neckerchief of faded navy blue, same material as t-shirt and I took them from the bed post. By now the money in the bag had turned into granola bars and peanut brittle. Grandma punched holes in a can of milk to mix with coffee.",Negative
"I was walking out of a tavern with a glass of beer in my hand when a bull came up to me from behind and bumped me. The jolt knocked the beer out of my hand. This angered me. I turned around and faced the bull and grabbed his horns. I started wrestling the bull like they wrestle calves in rodeos. Luckily the bull wasn't big, but his horns were. I was on my back on the ground holding on to his horns, trying to bring him down. [annoyance, neither pleasant or unpleasant, no color]",Negative
"This dream involves the attempted and successful acquisition of a number of shares in a gold mine. Having completed the transaction, there somehow appears in the dream a newly discovered mine that I have discovered and for some reason must keep a secret. Somehow along the line another scene comes in which one person has found out about it, I don't know how and he is much like the movie character Victor McLaughlin. At any rate, he seems somehow to have been aware of this mine, and he has decided that he is going to get hold of part of it anyway from me. I'm in a very difficult position because I must keep it secret at the same time and try to deal with him. The movie character is _______________ like Victor McLaughlin. At any rate, eventually it gets to the point where we're working on the mine and it seems like I went up a long flight of steps to get to the entrance of the mine and somehow he says he's going to do me in and take the mine for himself. This rather unnerves me, but nevertheless I feel compelled to keep the whole thing a secret and try to resolve it and work it out with him. I recall clearly there being a place, well some kind of restaurant, where he is eating a meal, and at the same time I'm trying to convince him that it would be reasonable that he accept a partial ownership of the mine rather than the whole thing. To buttress this argument I offer him the figure of $85 million as his yield from his share of the mine, and I say to him many times, ""Just consider it. Consider 85 million dollars. That means that you could spend 2 million dollars a year for the next 41-1/2 years."" No matter how many times I repeat this, which I do several times, no matter how I try to convince him, he is still determined that he is going to kill me and take the whole mine for himself. He seems completely impenetrable to any arguments I put forth. I'm being frustrated and yet determined and at the same time, strangely enough, not frightened of his plan of killing me, although I believe he's fully capable of it. Finally I seem to find myself tied up in a large plastic bag, and he's mixing a large trough of cement into which somehow I'm going to be immersed or in some way done in. Anyway I begin to argue with him about this mine again. Somehow or another, I don't remember how, I convince him to take me out of this plastic bag so we can discuss it further. The next scene is he's chasing me, and he chases me to a spot where there are 2 automobiles parked front end to front end so that the bumpers are touching. He begins to chase me around these 2 cars and we go around and around and around many, many times, going back and forth and he's getting angrier and angrier at me because he can't catch me. This seems to take place on a street such as Douglas Avenue where there's a few homes set back off the road and a couple of small palm trees there. All the while he's chasing me, I'm still trying to convince him that he should be partners with me. Actually having offered him 85 million, it represents more than 50% in an attempt to placate him. Then it seems across the street a very large truck pulls up and driving the truck is a female, very young and attractive and sitting next to her is her sister. They get out of the truck and lift the hood of the truck, somehow seemingly indicating that something was wrong with it. At this my pursuer walks over there and somehow engages in a conversation, and he went into the house with one of the girls in front of which they were parked, and somehow I believe I become engaged in conversation with the other one. Sure  enough ___________________________.  there was a great deal of color in the dream. While he's chasing me around the cars, the scene in front of the house, they seem to be old cars. I think they're black or dark blue. Grass was green, sky blue. The house was a white and coral color, that is a pinkish red, and the palm trees were green and brown. Everything seemed to be in natural color in that particular scene.  At the moment that I mentioned to him he could be spending 2 million dollars a year for the next 41-1/2 years, I think to myself, ""Why doesn't he realize that this 41-1/2 years comprises just about the rest of his lifetime?"" Then I think, I say also, that he could even throw a million dollars into a trust fund if he was afraid of running out of money for his old age. I keep thinking to myself, ""Why doesn't he realize that this is, this would cover the rest of his lifetime?"" It doesn't seem to impress him one iota. He seems rather thick and unable to comprehend anything, but this one overwhelming drive to have the whole mine for himself. It also seems that there's some vague impression of a third person being with us when I was talking with him at the restaurant. An adult male, but I have no idea who it was. He may have been wearing glasses also, that is this unknown character.",Negative
"The Harmless Scare  I'm at home, alone, in the bathroom. There are two toilets. One is normal, and the other is like a large blue plastic-like urinal, shaped like a satellite dish. I step into the bathtub and sit on this urinal, which is over the bathtub. The plastic is flimsy and it bends when I try to let it support my weight. I'm cautious, listening for intruders. I hear something in the other room and quickly get up to go see what it is. I'm scared of who it may be. I run blindly into the kitchen, knocking over a small blond boy holding a telephone book. There are several people there. I recognize them as my grade school mate Charlie Hander, who is still very blond but much larger in stature, my cousins Phil and Kyle Jessen, and another boy. When I see who it is, I do not feel threatened anymore. Confused, I ask them what they're doing. They say that their parents told them to come in and go to the bathroom. I look out the front window and see a large black truck and a huge white motor home parked in front of the house. I tell these kids to just knock, and to tell their parents just to have them knock next time!",Negative

"There is a performance of a musical opera which is set on ships at sea. In the first scene a group of two or three pirates kidnap three young ladies. Further details from the first scene are sketchy. The second scene takes place on the pirate ship, where the three lady hostages have been taken. In this opera, the decks of the ship are represented on stage by large sleeping hammocks. The ladies lie on the lower deck, or hammock, while the pirates are on the upper deck, or hammock. The pirates, singing their lines, decide amongst themselves to tease their captives. They proceed to do this by swinging the lower hammock back and forth in order to make the ladies dizzy. While swinging the hammock, they sing together in a strong clear voice. One of the ladies, however, is not bothered by the hammock swinging and she answers the pirates' song with a clear soprano voice of her own. The pirates sing their song louder, only to have the soprano answer in an aria which grows more and more beautiful, expressing her determination to be heard.",Positive
"Some kids got to school to start filming for a movie, myself included. Only a few people did. Later, we found out that there was going to be an assembly. Ms Solomon said ""... couldn't do this next year!"". I was next to Daryl and his hand was on my leg and I didn't feel weird. We got called to the assembly and the class got attacked. We ran into this assembly place which had two entrances at the top and then these steps went all the way across and continued down (like a cinema, without chairs). Then it was somewhere else and there was this alien guy called Arthur. He went yellow and his face was big. This lady nurse/receptionist got scared by him. The doctor came and was trying to help it. There was a photo of what Arthur looked like normally and we were descendents of him.",Negative
"A group, perhaps 8 or 10, of the Museum people are standing somewhere on the top floor, when Miss Prims enters. She stares down when passing and I seem to know she has something to tell me. As I approach, she says she has been shopping. I say yes, but it's not very hot, though I then realize that Miss Prims looks .... decidedly oppressive (sultry). I then say however, it is rather sultry. We go to my office, where I open locker to get my coat and find the collar has come off. I remember that the collar has been loose for several days. The collar is attached to a strip which runs down to bottom of coat. There is a red label in collar. The edges of the collar, where it had pulled loose, are uneven and more or less frayed, and the whole thing has a cheap look. There is a gray sweater in the locker and this, I tell Miss Prims it will do until I have the coat repaired at a nearby tailor shop. Miss Prims. then says that she has heard that I have had some sort of an argument, almost a disagreement, with Dyke. I explain the trouble was with Duze, not Dyke, and was in connection with some ""mail sorting"" which can be explained as follows. There was a certain street on which were several houses built even with sidewalk line (as in Baltimore). On one of these a basement window stood open and when people passed this window nails (about 8 or 10 penny size) whizzed by them and struck against a brick wall across the street. 2 men (one apparently Anderson) and I did some detective work by walking back and forth past this window. We soon determined that the nails were coming out of this window, whereupon Anderson walks quickly to the window and directs a flashlight beam around the basement. It showed a boy, apparently black, crouched on the floor. He had shot the nails by means of a regular rubber gun -- or possibly 2 rubbers fastened to his fingers.",Negative
"I dreamt about putting ketchup in a bag full of it.  I missed my American History class (?) because my mother wanted to visit.  There was an oppressor, selling trees for firewood because there was 'no good furniture'.  People had to trade in, and it was completely unfair.  I took a long pine tree and put it in his mouth, as I was directed.  But I pushed it far, because I hated him, yet had to work for him.  There was an unloading zone that looked like the elementary school parking lot and a family bringing a bed to unload.",Negative
"I got my pay and the man counted the cash and paid me after I signed my name on the pay voucher. It was wet and I had to sign way above the line. I signed John Evans. I was afraid someone would rob me, so I hid behind some rocks and I saw like a shadow behind others. I finally counted it. I had leather belts and it was stamped on the belt 21.00 and there were holes in the belt and by each hole there was so much cash per hole stamped on the belt. I saw myself being robbed by Biblical time. I saw a motor that pushed a drill in and out about 12 inches. There was a long, thin drill on it and I put it near TesarÕs face and it went up and down near his face. Ann and I took a ride on a streetcar.",Negative

"A fellow showed us a piece of gold he held in his hand. Another man tried to force him to let him know where the gold was, but he wouldnÕt tell. I saw an object jumping or bouncing on the sidewalk, then it bounced over the bank. I had an idea it was under the sidewalk where the bouncing object was, so I dug under the sidewalk and came to some bricks and they were made like a vault. So I took the bricks off and I saw wax paper rolled in like dynamite sticks and there were fuses stuck in them. I found the treasure before I could open up the sticks. They started to sizzle and I threw some in different directions, then it dawned on me to pull out the fuses, so I did. I was supposed to have found a recipe in the treasure chest. I looked on the sidewalk and there carved in it was Johnny. I looked at it. Our small baby had some kind of rash, pimples all over its body. I called for a doctor and I couldnÕt think of his name. I held the phone for a long time, then gave up. Ann went to the doctor and he held her in his lap as he examined her.

"I am in a college dorm room, I think it was my old room at [City] College and B was rooming with me and we had pizza in our room and I said ""there's no anchovies on this pizza"" and we wanted anchovies on it. And I was in bed and she had an anchovy all wrapped up in paper and she handed it to me and I unwrapped it and I was surprised that she had brought one and I said ""well how did you know that we were going to have pizza in the first place?"". I don't know what she said and we were laughing about it and I asked her if she wanted the anchovy and she said ""no"" I could have it. So I ate it. At some point I opened my suitcase and got my transistor radio out and turned it on, I was trying to find a religious show but I found Dr. Dean Edell and I was listening to him. There was a whistle in the radio, it wasn't coming in so good, and I remember that my suitcase was really light. In reality my suitcases are very heavy usually. It was the larger kind, not the little tiny ones that you usually get on pizza, so I tasted the anchovy then there was a man there, who I think was a psychologist, but he seemed very old, like around 85 and his wife was there, and somehow his suitcase or briefcase was locked and he couldn't get it open and he had important things in there that he had to get, that he had papers that showed him how to open it, a combination perhaps, but he couldn't remember where he had put them and so he couldn't get it open and I was trying to help and I said ""try not to think about it and maybe you'll remember, if you try not to think about it, sometimes you'll remember things about where you put things"".

I call a TV repair service to fix the TV. It took a long time but the service man showed up. After considerable time he was done and he presented the bill. It was outrageous to me. There were three items and two seemed reasonable but the third was excessive. I talked to the repair man about this. He showed me a part that seemed like a simple plug. I did not pay the bill but said I would contact the owners. I asked if labor was included and he said no. The repair man had been to the house before.,Positive
"Shaving  I'm shaving using my Schick razor. I cut myself on the right side of my upper lip and on my right cheek. There are many tiny nicks on my face, as if the blade weren't sharp or I didn't use enough shaving cream. Little pieces of skin stick out making the cut seem more like a bloody rash.  I'm outside the field house at Brimson sitting in an elevated place, like a balcony or on a small hill. I prepare to shave, using a lot of shaving cream. I don't have a mirror. I start to shave by making one stroke on my lower neck.  I'm at home in Oak Valley. I see myself shaving in the bathroom mirror. The first stroke I made without a mirror isn't bad. My mom calls me and says that a woman has just called for me. The woman's name is something like ""Jake"". Her message is that I don't need to bring Carlos Casteneda's book The Teachings of Don Juan to school tomorrow: she has finished reading it. I can't figure out whom this woman is that was calling. I think it may be my high school classmate Carmen Allure.  I'm outside near the Brimson field house overlooking Granger Field. There is a boy and two men playing football there. The ground is partially covered with patches of melting snow, and is really wet. The boy throws the football. One of the men is running for the pass. He dives and gets soaking wet, as if it was his duty to expend the effort to dive since the boy was throwing it. I shave thick hair off my neck and start to shave my upper chest.

"First of all, I think the first, I had a lot of elements that were real fragmented, now when I think about it. But I think I laid through a lot of stage one, just kind of half conscious awareness from 5:30 to 6:00 this morning, so that's how it got all fragmented. But some elements that I can remember first is that my application into Modern Media College I was pretty sure was going to be rejected for some reason, and I had kind of resigned myself to the thought that I just can't be in the sound business because my vision prevents me from doing some, perceiving and acting socially, and I think I move around too slowly on some of the programs and there's no way in the world that I can operate these big huge mixer boards. Now this is all what I'm thinking in my dream, as I'm standing in this yellow room with big boards all over everywhere, almost like our kitchen is now, except it was huge like a warehouse. And I was just standing there thinking, and I had the feeling like there were like tons of people around me, but nobody was saying anything, I didn't hear anything. I was just thinking all of this. [blowing noise] Ummmm, a big blob of snot! Anyway, now that that's out of the way, then the next scene that I can remember is that I was at home. It was like the night before I had classes, like last night was, and I was sick with some kind of cold or flu or something, and I was laying on the couch with Mom and we were kind of almost asleep. And I was singing to her. And I had some kind of thing where I still couldn't go to sleep and I had to get up and take some kind of medicine, so she got up with me. And we went in the kitchen, which was kind of normal, the way it used to be, and she had me take a few pills by drinking down some water and taking them. And then she gave me applesauce that had like peanuts chopped up in it, and I think I ate it and it was good, and as I was eating it, I woke up. [laugh] That was kind of crazy, but I think this is a very telling dream that brings out some of the inhibitions that I have and this subconscious fear that I have, that no matter how hard I try, I'm not going to be capable in this field. And even if I were to realize that, I would be just devastated, and I'd probably be like a societal hermit for the rest of my life. At this point I don't know what else to do with my life. I know that's bad, but it is, it's true. And I guess I've been thinking a lot about going away. I've already started a little box of stuff, and I practiced filling out a practice application on last year's, in last year's catalog, and it slipped down behind my bed. And I figured, ""Oh heck, it's just last year's scrap copy anyway; it doesn't matter."" And I even had a duplicate in my catalog, but I think that might have had something to do with it.",Negative

"I dreamed I was standing on a dock when my friend Bill Randol came up with a brown inboard runabout that he had found for me to buy. He said it was $3500. I said it was more than I wanted to pay for a boat, but I bought it anyway. Bill and I were going to take my mother and grandmother for a ride. They both got in and Bill and I were standing on opposite sides of the boat in waist deep water. When I hoisted myself up on the side of the boat it catapulted my grandmother out into the water on my side. I pulled her back and got her back in the boat. This time I let Bill get in his side first with the result that my mother went overboard the same way my grandmother had.

We are at a Retreat Center gathering; I call Frank to pick me up and it is raining; some confusion; at one point I am with a couple and their baby and I keep putting on the baby's blue hat; finally I get into our Honda and drive smoothly down our street: suddenly my car turns into a bicycle and I pedal as fast as I can.

"My wife Bonita and I were in bed in a room in a dorm at my alma mater.  John and Lois were in town for the weekend, and I wanted us to go visit them.  Bonita didn't think she could spare the time, and wasn't particularly interested in going anyway, so I decided to go by myself.  I felt a bit guilty about going without her, because I knew how possessive she is about weekends, and I tried to figure out how I could spend only part of the time with them and still enjoy it, and be able to spend the rest of it with her.  There was a telephone in our room, but I didn't know the number; so when I had left the building, I thought I should have it, and I threw a little rock up at her window.  When I got her attention and asked her for the number, someone near me replied with the number which must have been the main number for the dorm, but I told him we had a phone in our room.  I vaguely remember several experiences in connection with going to see John and Lois.  In one, Terrence Bailey was going with me.  Still at my alma mater, we went to the dorm for something (in the direction of Clark Hall, actually), and found the whole dorm was gone.  While we were sitting or squatting in front of where the dorm should have been, a whole bunch of soldiers popped up from a line of concealed foxholes, and we were caught in the middle of some kind of battle; I was embarrassed at having been taken by surprise.  We were taken to a temporary building then, where I was supposed to see a major.  While waiting outside his office with others, some of them were looking at my field jacket and trying to figure out my rank.  In one place I still had a single bar, in another the double bar.  I began to worry that I would get in trouble for being out of uniform, even though I was off active duty -- and also self-conscious about having a beard while in uniform.  So I told Doug Sterme (who now takes the place of Terrence Bailey) that we could just sneak away, since they didn't know our names.    At some other time, I was also in a waiting room with some other men, none of them in uniform, when someone asked me who was the highest ranking man there.  We all kind of looked at each other, then one man raised his hand and said, ""I'm a captain.""  Whereupon I replied, ""I'm a major.""  When we got out of one or the other of these places, I was with Terrence again, and we were looking for my car.  It was a small foreign car, apparently fairly new, and I couldn't remember where I had parked it.  We walked up and down the nearby streets.  I think Tarver finally gave up and went some other way, and I went to my house and asked Daddy where it was.  He told me, but I don't remember what came of it, because I became somehow faced with the prospect of walking to my destination.  It would be via hilly, dusty country roads, and about the distance from Mother's house in my hometown to where Uncle Jack used to live in my hometown-about 12 miles.  Apparently I had walked it before, but this time my legs started collapsing.  And I had to climb a cyclone fence with barbed wire on top, on the edge of a short but steep embankment near something like a gas station.  I didn't know if I could make it, and was afraid besides that I might get in trouble for climbing the fence.  So all these things conspired to force me to retrace my steps to a sort of tourist information office.  Connie Hutchinson was inside.  I had to go to the bathroom the same time she did, and she said we could go at the same time.  She led me there, locked the door, and showed me how she could urinate standing up.    I don't remember how I finally made it to where John and Lois were staying, but I did, and it was an old house on a highway resembling the main drag in Ocean City.",Negative

I started complaining in disgust and told her to get rid of it. She told Ezra to put it in my room and I said to put it in the bin.

So the ignition started up by itself and I floored the accelerator and I started going 60 and 70 miles an hour on a regular city street, and before I knew it, I was going 90 or 100 and I suddenly screeched on the brake and I spun around and spun around and spun around, and I'm like, ""Oh no, am I crashing?""

"It entailed me and 2 of the maintenance men that work here in this complex, playing a game of Monopoly. We have a fairly large dining area in this building where I live. Both of these men is named Dick, Dick T and Dick B. and they're both very nice, capable men, in terms of taking care of needs and repairs. We were sitting at one of the tables out in the dining area and the Monopoly board was on the table in front of us with all the little pieces, the ship and the shoe and the whole thing on the board, but we were playing with several decks of cards. Somehow we would score the Monopoly game by the hands of the cards we were dealt. And Dick T and I were doing very well, we would get good hands, but Dick B got 2 zeros in a row, became very angry and said ""I ain't playing this game no more and got up and left"".",Negative

"The Change  An abrupt change occurs. Something or someone goes in, a big change happens, and that thing or person then goes out of whatever it went in to earlier. This is a major change.

"The Sketchy Bus Ride  I'm riding on a metro bus with others. I don't know where to get off the bus. It's late and night and the driving conditions are extremely poor: it's very foggy outside. The woman driving the bus is wearing an akubra-like hat. She speaks on the radio as she drives, communicating with the bus station base to let them know we're in dangerous conditions, and that they should check in on us if they don't hear from us in a while. We ride over the Dirty River bridge to the Riverside School area. We're returning then, after having gone somewhere. We don't know whether to get off the bus at my dad and Lisa's house.

"I'm travelling with a family - mother, father, teenage son and 3 or 4 younger kids, and a couple that's maybe his sister and her husband. We're going somewhere, and the name Lawrence, Kansas, comes up, but maybe it's only a stop. There's a lot of disagreement about the direction to take: we've been looking at the map and the father wants to go kinda straight north and visit somebody we know, but the brother-in-law says there isn't any connecting highway and he doesn't want to leave the road we've been on. He wants to leave the group; it isn't necessary that we stay together, but the father is doing his best to convince him to stay. While they're arguing, I have a look at the map myself. It does look a lot like this northern road just goes straight up and stops, but if you follow it back down a bit you can see an intersection with a big highway that will work just fine for us. So it's ok. The map I'm looking at is white, instead of being a standard one. The place we are, if it's a hotel, is kind of old and we seem to be sort of camped out in a long hallway instead of in rooms. Or it's like a gallery - there are windows open, showing daylight and a view of the town and treetops - we're upstairs - and we have our luggage around. I've sort of made sandwiches for everybody, but ran out of filling and there's bread left over. Also not everybody's eating the bread and I'm gathering it back up in case we need it later. At the other end of the hall the kids are playing, a little noisy. The older son is sort of babysitter. There's one very little kid; she's playing on the floor and has crawled into a tote bag with those strap handles and is puttering about like a windup toy. The son laughs. It is pretty cute. So we make it to this town we want to visit - there's a house where a friend of the family is working as a live-in housekeeper for a young executive - she left our home town to come here and we haven't seen her in a good while. This place keeps her busy, all right - the guy's not mean but he's demanding in that absent way that a lot of yuppies get - don't know any other way to get what they want, very regimented existence. She's a little harried, trying to keep up with him. (She's black, reminds me of a young Pearl Bailey but not a comedian.) I go to see this guy where he works - he's just about as harried as she is, trying to keep up with the demands of his bosses - they've got everything all laid out for their people. The executives get free groceries. There's a small grocery store right here on the office compound. (It's not a high-rise.) But there's not enough time for them to let everybody do their shopping when they want to, or something - they have this regimented, too. All these executives get 5-minute shopping sprees (once a day? I guess) - there's a guard with a gate and he has the schedule. I'm going along with our boy to help him out, but once I get in I get hampered by something and can't get hold of what I want. I look around for the guy and he's already gone. (Geez these guys can't help themselves, can they? Everything has to be done in a hurry.) I take what I do have and go back to the gate. There's a bottle of Canoe on the floor in my way - I assume it's been dropped by somebody and I kick it to one side. As I go through the gate, the guard says that that's the bottle of Canoe that was stolen the last time I came through here. Since I haven't even been in this town before, I assume he was talking to somebody else or some other error. I look at him but keep going on my way. It does occur to me that he was fishing - he's trying to nail a shoplifting charge on me. Why? Nobody's stopped me so far, but I'm beginning to wonder if he isn't maybe going to sick the cops on me. Geez. I go back around to this executive's office. I thought he was getting extra groceries for the visitors at his house, but when I go by I can see a lot of people sitting down to dinner in his office. It's got big glass windows - the interior reminds me of the old Peabody's. I'm not dressed up like they are, I guess I better go on back to his house and not interrupt his dinner party.",Negative

"This seems to be just a fragment. I'm like in the Navy and I think in a chow line. There's a purveying feeling here of something very new and all-encompassing. It reminds me of the feeling I had when I went in the Navy. It's like there are two kinds of people, or two classes, or two ranks. Let's say it's ranks. I've been promoted for a transfer from one to the other, and I was standing in line here, in the chow line, and this member of this new group that I'm moving into is standing there, and we're joking and talking, sort of getting ready to make friends. Meanwhile there's an old friend of mine from the other group who is up ahead and has already gone through the line and is sitting eating at the corner of one of the tables. Apparently he and I have made some kind of plans previously to eat together if it can be worked out. I'm somewhat at odds with myself. I don't quite know what is to be expected in this kind of a situation. I'm sort of caught between both of them and their expectations. Just before I was awakened, I had just decided to try to satisfy both sides by just walking down a few tables with my tray and setting it down next to this old friend of mine and saying to the new friend something like, trying to figure out what to say either making this look like it's chance, a chance meeting or saying something about having a previous appointment. This whole thing reminds me of junior high school days in the seventh grade when Frank _____ and John Tihanic and I were just making fast friends of each other, and John Tihanic was kind of the, everybody's favorite. He must often have felt the way I did in the dream. One other thing associated with this dream, either in it or certainly as I was trying to remember it, this came in.

"I went over to Lakeland Dr to the old house there. I saw a woman in the living room, feeding a baby. She had another child that was a little bit older - maybe 5 or 6 years old, a girl. The room was pretty messy. There was a screen door. The door was open so I walked up to the screen door and I asked if I could step inside for a second. She said okay. I could tell she was a little hesitant because she didn't know me or why I was there. I stepped inside and said, My name is Anna. I used to live here. You don't know me obviously. I wondered if I could just walk through the house. She said it wasn't a very good time that they really hadn't even closed on the house yet. I said that was fine, that I understood. I put my hand on my chest and was fighting back tears. I said that it was okay and that maybe I could come back another time. I left. As I got to the front sidewalk another woman came out. She was the owner of the house - that was selling the house. We talked a little bit. I introduced myself and told her the same thing - that I used to live there and that I really just wanted to walk through the house. Her husband came out. We were all looking down the street and talking. They said that they had had trouble selling it and ended up selling it for less than they had hoped. I said I had the same problem. I was divorced. Actually, what I said is that we were going through a divorce so I just had to sell it. I told them the neighbors had gotten upset with me because I sold it as low as I did, but that I really didn't have much choice because I had to sell it and move. We had a nice talk. They both gave me their business cards and in fact the woman gave me two of them. She had two different business cards. They told me to give them a call in a few days and they would see if they could arrange for me to come over and walk through the house. There was a third person there but I don't know who she was or what her connection was to all of this. Now I'm standing at this outdoor sink. There's an attachment on the sink, kind of like the ones you would pull out to spray and rinse out the sink. I was doing something with that. It wasn't exactly like that though. It was a hose and the end of it looked more like a garden hose. I had put something in the end of it and was thinking about that. It was almost like it had something to do with a penis.",Negative

One (I think only one came in) opened the cupboard, but he didn't see me, but he somehow sensed I was in there and I got up and was running away from him. He got sick of running, I suppose, and went back to the ship but I realized he was going to blow the house up, so I ran into the shed and then I heard an explosion. The house was still standing though. The predator bloke had a look and happy with the results, he left the house and told the rest not to search the house again. Then they flew away.

"It all seems rather vague and strange because I can't remember or identify or associate a dream with any of my actions. My feeling was in general bewilderment. There was some sort of action in this dream as in a sport. I don't know what the action was or why. The setting was very limited. It was just a few pieces of furniture and myself and that's all. An indoor rather than an outdoor activity. No, I wasn't the sole character. There was another person in it also. The only way I can identify this other person is as my partner. We were playing a game in which both of us were equal. The dream seemed to be a very active dream. I can't recall the basis of the action. I can recall that it was an active dream like playing tennis. In fact, it may have been playing tennis. Setting not clear. It may have been an arena or any place I have been before. It could have been a grove, an exit. The dream wasn't clear enough to decide whether there were any spectators, intangible, vague idea.",Positive
"A series of dreams about raging water, but I seem to be unafraid.

Another dream involved a huge roiling waterfall. I think it is beautiful.",Positive
"A young woman and her husband and baby live out in the woods. They all sleep together in a sleeping bag under the trees. Now they've built a house. It has no furniture. It is only one room. I look inside and my voice is like a narrator on a TV show pointing out the features: a solid floor that has insulation underneath, a piece of green-yellow carpet on one half of the floor. The walls are handcrafted stained glass windows to shine beautiful colors with the sunlight. I try to make them look more beautiful. A roof to keep off the cold winter rain. The side wall opposite me opens up so that I see a porch with people on it, and a lovely view of the meadow and the river. People are swimming in the river. I have to sit up tall to see them over the rocks.",Positive

"I got an email from the university about driving. I told Mom that Ezra needed to change his phone number and he was angry about it. I was then at university and Ms Burton was there. I had math and we had to round to 30.10, but someone said it was 30.11 but then that was wrong because we were dealing with money. Anyway, I can't remember properly but I found out that Dean had been bitten by a werewolf. We were at a beach and some others got back to the house (which was at the beach). It was very busy and there were long queues. I asked Mom if she knew about Rover and she said ""that Rover's a werewolf? Yeah."". He was outside and she put food out for him. Then it was night but I was with him outside. I was trying to get around the back. It wasn't a full moon though. I got there and then he started to change. I ran in and he tried to come in. I started to cry and was upset. Then some celebrity woman and her husband were doing something. She was in a dressing gown and her boobs started to hang out.

"I am in church somewhere with long rows of pews-sort of like First Christian Church in my hometown.  Mother is sitting far to my right in the row in front of me.  While the preacher is talking, Mother starts talking to me out loud about something not pertaining to church; I can't make her be quiet, and Daddy won't do anything about it.  Pretty soon the preacher stops talking and begins just looking at us.  It is causing quite a disturbance.  Finally I can stand it no longer, so I get up and rush toward the door in humiliation.  When I get to the door, the floor there is on a terrific slant, sort of like in the Reflection Maze, down and to the left.  I grab the knob as I fall back.  The door comes open, my hand slips off the knob, and I start not sliding but flying backwards toward one corner.  I am horrified, because I am trying to make an inconspicuous exit.  I land almost on top of some lady I know (Mrs. Butler, I think).  Some people come around to the corner, and I hear one of them say something which indicates that they think my neck might be broken.  It isn't, though.  After I get up, I go around and apologize to almost everybody.",Negative
"Dovre and I are at the movies. Tyler hands me a letter he wrote me. It is long and sweet, emotional. He starts by describing our first day together at work. ""We were on a tall hill and looked over the scene,"" he began. I was touched and felt close to him. A woman is giving frothy lemon meringue pie pieces out to starving poor people. I think she is harming them, giving them something for nothing, teaching them to beg, and it's not nutritious. She's upset with me for not giving pies out. We talk back and forth. Then she mumbles, ""Some people aren't very giving."" ""Some women in particular,"" Dylan smiles because he sees I've got the hint and I'm filling with righteous anger and am about to tell her what for. I sit up and say, ""What did you say? Could you repeat that?"" She does. I say, ""I understand what you're really saying and I want you to know some people give in different ways. Some people answer the telephone at 3:00 a.m. and listen to the other person's fears and pain."" I guess I told her!",Negative
"I'm walking in a parking garage with Kristie and we're talking and we walk up and up the garage's multiple levels. When we're about halfway up, she pulls out a baggie of mushrooms, but they look like dehydrated mangos and we both take some. I feel ""high"" in my dream and I stumble around and it's hard to stay balanced. We get to the top of the garage and start walking down the ramp to the street. When we're halfway down the ramp we look back up at the levels and I see a colorful peacock laying dead on the cement. We're too far away to touch it, so I throw a rock and miss it. Kristie is very upset by this sight and says something like, ""We're on mushrooms and shouldn't be letting ourselves get depressed by this dead bird. Let's get out of here."" Now we're walking on a sidewalk uphill with a street on the left and a sloping hill to the right. Now there is another guy walking behind us. I've never seen him before.

"I was in a boat race.  Going around the track I went through a housing area.  Part of the track was curvy and I was going too fast- my boat scraped the railing.  I wanted to stop at a Wendy's in the next town.  I stopped where I thought it was, and it was a restaurant, but I didn't see any Wendy's signs.  I walked towards the back where the bathrooms were to check the other side.  A woman approached me and asked if I wanted anything.  I asked for water, but she said they didn't have any.  So I asked what had the most water in it and she said tea.  She started to leave to get me some and I told her I didn't have any money.  She said that was alright, vote for us and you can have it.  I was leery, not being a resident of their state or anything.  But I sat down and read about their governor.  I think his name was Garfield something.  A while later came the end of the race.  We were on horses now, not boats.  There were about four of us coming in at once.  After crossing the finish line, we all ran towards our waiting families.  Some got held up in the crowds so just ended up hugging opponent's families first.  Then we were gathered together to 'replay' the start of the race for pictures.

"Tickets to Broadway  I'm in a station wagon by the Greasepit near the adjacent restaurant's parking lot. With me are two people: Mave from my music class and another guy I don't know. We have a box full of stuff, at the bottom of which are a lot tickets to Broadway shows! They can be sold for hundreds to thousands of dollars. I'm not sure how we got them. They are either stolen or lost and found or received for free. I'm not sure if we should keep them, as is Mave. But I want to keep them.

"First of all, this was after everybody left and after all the dust settled and I could start remembering my dreams again and I wouldn't get so tired. I dreamt that I was getting ready for school and I was all dressed and ready to go, and I had my book bag and my books and stuff. It was going to be my first day. And I went in the bathroom to go to the bathroom and there was this faucet on the wall, like opposite the toilet, and there were two of them and they were just spraying water out of control. And I went in there and I got myself all wet. They were spraying after me as I went and I just closed the door and I said, ""Alright."" And then I got my shoes and stuff and told Mom about it, and I don't remember what she said. But that was short-lived. The other weird dream I had was I dreamt that Samantha and Sandra and I were going through my magic show stuff. And there was this recording of me doing a magic show a long time ago and people cheering and clapping, playing even one of the magic show things. And then I said, ""Where is that coming from?"" and Samantha pulled out this mechanical chickie and she said, ""This is a magic chick; now watch it."" And it had like a little heart thing on its hand; you know how mechanical things do. And when you would press it, it would say, ""Hi, I'm a magic chick. If you want to play magic,"" something about the something blue. You'd have to activate a blue king or blue foot thing or something.

"Melanie's New Love  My friend Melanie McDyss shows up at my house (not my real home) to visit. We haven't seen each other in a long time. We talk and joke. I'm lying on the floor and she is sitting on my chest. She spreads her legs and sits with her crotch facing my head. This is uncomfortable for me because I interpret it as sexual but know that she has no sexual intent by this, and is just comfortable sitting like that: she is trusting of me not to abuse, alter, or threaten our friendship. I ask her about her life. She tells me about a relationship with a man named Luis. She says she is in love with him. At 8:01pm she jokes that I've never asked her to stay over later than 8:00pm. I'm then cooking and eating broccoli with spaghetti sauce. We continue to talk. I joke that I try to keep a three to five day schedule in keeping in contact with her, while she seems to keep a five to seven day schedule in keeping touch with me. I say, ""I always try to get you, get in touch with you every three to five days."" Instantly I recognize the parapraxis, but continue talking, nonchalantly joking as if it didn't occur. She doesn't let on that she recognized it, which is characteristic of her, regardless of if she actually recognized it, which I think she did. She explains that by coming over to see me tonight she was consciously breaking out of the five to seven day schedule. Earlier, we talked about her and Luis going to Luis' paternal grandmother's funeral. Luis is Catholic.",Negative
"4. A scrooge type takes his son, maybe it's me, with him while collecting rent in these tenements. He has his whole family with him. They leave the car on the outskirts and walk to this small, dingy, indescribably dirty and bug-infested room where there's a man and 2 women who have not yet paid their rent. The scrooge type is saying how he only makes a few pennies on each one and it's only because he owns 340 of them that he can survive. So he can't afford for anyone to be late in paying their rent. Then I was wondering whether to say with 340 houses, he must be rich or to say if he only made a few pennies he can afford to miss one. I keep noticing how black and spidery everything is. One of the women is suggesting that the 2 women decide never to leave to the outside world in order that the man can go and earn the rent.",Positive
"First of all, I dreamt that it was kind of like the middle of summer and I sort of had the notion that I had graduated from Modern Media College, but then again other aspects seemed to indicate that I was back in high school. So I really don't know where I was. And I had the keyboard set up on TV trays in the bedroom because Mom had handed me a piece of sheet music and wanted me to sight read it. She was sitting down on the floor and she found this page under the bed, and it was all full of dust. I don't even remember what song it was, but I was all set to go, I had it in my hands and I was ready to go. And Dad came home. [laugh] And he was going to come in the bedroom and read or something or do his taxes I think. And I was going, ""Ahhhhhhhhh,"" but I tried to stay calm and I said, ""Could you please go outside? I have to do something yet."" And he went outside, yet he seemed to know all along what was going on. He seemed to know that I had something up my sleeve and all, and the thing had turned a greenish color while all that was going on, a light yellowish green and still kind of shiny. I don't know; that was messed up, man. And then I don't remember what happened. I think I quick shoved it under the bed or something.",Negative
"I am in a crowd of people. We are mixing, hoping to find a love. I see Riker of Star Trek and like him. He seems attracted to me. Now it's time to play a softball game and I'm telling who is on what bases, and all the players are ready except for first base (who is on first). It is supposed to be Riker and I look up at the second story windows and yell ""Riker! you are on."" He comes sleepily to the window; he'd been napping. He comes down. Now Troi and I are in bed together cuddling. I am aware of her lovely naked body and as we adjust or position, my hand accidentally brushes past the nipple of one breast. I feel a little tense but assure myself this is not sexual, merely sensual and, in fact, that is so. We are talking about it being time for me to change, because if I don't, it won't be possible to leave the planet and go with Riker. In order to help me, Troi calls in Ellie who had prepared a series of rocks (a gate, etc.) tied up by a string. I say, ""You really want to get it of me, don't you?"" semi-teasing. She says seriously, ""No, but l want... (something like you to be happy)."" Troi and I then exchange bodies so I can experience what it is like to be free of my own patterns of thought and feeling I've built up since birth, and to experience her way of feeling her own feelings. It's a delightful experience. Then I see her push a table over and hit her ankle and limp with pain. I go and kneel in front of her and try to be sympathetic. ""Does it hurt?"" I ask.

"I was taking a canoe trip in the wild parts of Canada with two other people, Leonard and George , Leonard being a man of about 35 or 40 with whom I did take a couple of canoe trips in Canada a number of years ago when I was in the Explorer Scouts, and George being a friend of mine from high school, about the same age as me, although I haven't seen him in a number of years. In the first part of this trip we were climbing a small mountain, just Leonard and I were climbing it. George didn't want to climb because it was a very dangerous climb where one of us would have to grab onto some handholds and then the other person would have to climb over the person and grab on himself and so on, continuously climbing over each other in order to get up. I remember being at one place trying to get some handholds that were sturdy and not being able to for several minutes. I was slipping, but I finally grabbed on and Leonard climbed on up over me and then he was at the top, and I climbed up with him and we sat on the top of this mountain, which was a pretty sharp point with just a couple of places that we could straddle. We looked around over the lakes below and mountains off in the distance. Then we climbed back down, which seemed to take place very quickly. The three of us were sort of planning our trip, looking at some maps of the area. Leonard was showing us where we were now and where we would be going. I had some topographical maps of my own which I pulled out of my pocket, or rather out of my knapsack, and I was marking down where we were with some numbers to locate where our next designation would be. Just a comment here: these maps remind me very much of a map I looked at yesterday in a state park we were in. So I was kind of worried a little bit with George being on the trip because I thought he had never been canoeing before to speak of, and this was going to be a pretty rough trip. And I wasn't sure he would be able to take this continuous paddling all the time. Then with us actually starting on our trip, it seems that instead of getting into some canoes, we were on a platform and we got on a train that was our own train. My recall of things gets rather hazy at this point, but it seems we had gotten off the train again without having gone anywhere on it. The three of us went to the bathroom in the basement of this building, which seems to be a college building. Then we came back up and got on the train again. Then somehow there were some Chinese people, or somebody like Chiang Kai Shek or something, involved in the dream and maybe some spies or something, and I really don't recall just what happened.",Negative

"There is still an element in this one of trying to control sleeping or dreaming by -- I lost that one. At any rate, it's probably a reflection of trying to get to sleep.

The second one is the same make watch with a very simple design. It has a white face and the name of this one is Cellulex. I can still see that although they're essentially the same watch. There's something here about a cuckoo going off and on every fifteen minutes. I can see this as a cuckoo clock on the wall, although in the dream it's one of these wrist watches that has that feature. There was another part, but I seem to lose it.

I was upset that she would do that without consulting me.  There was a certain practicality to it-I couldn't deny that-but it made a narrow passage in the kitchen and besides, we were only renting the house and didn't have the right to make renovations.

"Seeing Double  I wake p in an apartment room with an erection. I start to masturbate. I ejaculate quickly, but have no sensation of orgasm, so I keep masturbating. The semen forms a gooey white ball that I masturbate with. My green wool hat is pulled over my eyes a bit, partially obscuring my view. The room appears to be double, as if one wall is a mirror and there is a large reflection. I notice the door is open about ten inches. I get up and close the door. The hallway outside is dark. I continue to masturbate with the ball of semen. I hear a voice from the next room, which I recognize as my sister Heather. She says, ""Kenneth, what are you doing?"", in such a way that she implies that she suspects or knows that I'm masturbating. This surprises and embarrasses me. I notice the window and shades are open. I get up and close them. Still embarrassed and surprised, I pretend I'm sleep talking, mumbling words out loud. I'm scared of seeing things (in double) that aren't real in the room. I'm frightened and caught off guard by the open door and window.",Negative

He handed me four ivory-handled knives. I took them at his bidding and cast them (quite awkwardly) in the direction of the approaching man. They seemed to be charmed for they all found their mark.",Negative
"I had a strange dream. I dreamt I married my two cousins. That is, she was getting married, but at the exit I realized that I was the one dressed as a bride. I remember that my cousin put my veil on me in church and she gave me the bouquet and then I came out with the bridegroom.",Positive
"My kid sister (15) and I were getting ready for bed in the room next to ours. I went into our room to get my pajamas and I noticed that the window shades were up. Our double room looked out on the porch roof and as I walked to the window, I had the feeling that someone was on the roof. I pulled the blind down, but a hand reached in the window and pushed it back up. A man was out on the roof grinning at me. I was angry and tried to call my father, but I couldn't. I went into his room and woke him up. I told him very incoherently what happened and he got up. I didn't want him to go in our room because he might get hurt, but he insisted. As he walked down the hall, I forced myself to wake up. I was afraid to go back to sleep because I didn't want to know what might come next.",Negative
"Sandal Scandal  I'm in a gathering with what seems to be a family. There are two cute young women in the family. One of them says something to me about having her sandals. I'm surprised. I have a pair of sandals that I found somewhere, but I didn't think they belonged to her or anyone. I make a comment that asserts that she must be mistaken because I don't have her sandals, though now I know that I do have them. She backs off thinking she must be mistaken. I am called to get my plate of food.",Negative
"I was playing a Mario game. I called it Super Mario Sunshine a few times. It started off as a race and I had to collect stuff on the way. You had to collect people (celebrities) and coins and other stuff that was scattered around. You got stars (like in Mario games). I won the race the first time but skipped a lot of the stuff. I tried another time and there was Neve Campbell and Drew Barrymore and some other girl. The other girl had to take Neve's place and wear a weird hat. There was a wood slope up and you had to be Beaver Mario to get up. There was a platform with holes, which was covered in people. Dad came home and had no pants on. I told him and he put a shirt on. I told him I was playing because I was going to study later and it was boring.",Negative
"I am looking at a rack of clothes and see a pretty blouse. I say, ""I don't remember owning this."" Then I realize it's my mother's blouse. She says, ""You can have it."" She looks slim and young and well dressed. Dee Dee is also there, so I put it on. It is black with little flowers on it (roses) and short-waisted. I look good. I say, ""I have a tension headache,"" and Dee Dee places her hands on my head to massage it. It feels very good. She hurts her hand and hops around wiggling it in the air. I apologize. She says, ""It's OK. I see Bob V. I say, ""Hey Bob, what about the scanner?"" He says, ""What about it?"" I say, ""Can I borrow it? He says, ""Sure. Let's talk about it over a drink, a tomato and a drink after work."" I say, ""OK."" He leaves and I say to Dee Dee, ""He's married."" She says, ""Well, last week he had an affair with Mirabelle."" I decide to go to my office without my wheelchair, to walk it. I hope I have enough energy. I start down lst floor hall and remember my office is on the 4th floor. I feel strong and good and hope it lasts the whole day. I pass a flower shop and a friend says, ""How do you like it after we remodeled?"" I said, ""It looks good,"" and put a flower in my hair. I pass a counter. A woman says, ""You're a Jew."" I say, ""Think again,"" quite belligerent. She is mortified and embarrassed for her mistake. I lecture her and go to find the elevator. I finally find it. Two other women with their guitars are on the elevators. The doors are malfunctioning and no one else can get on. We are worried, but make it to the 4th floor.

"I was going to take a trip to Los Angeles to attend some kind of academic conference.  At the airport I ran into Li Min Kim.  He was going back to Korea because of some problem with his eyes.  I had to go up several escalators to get my ticket.  When I got it, I realized I had forgotten my passport.  In case we ended up going to a foreign country, I didn't want to be denied the opportunity.  The plane was to be boarding in 50 minutes, so I figured I had just enough time if I hurried.  The next thing I remember, I was in L.A. waiting to see some professor I know in his anteroom.  Then I was in a large room or an upper floor of a tall hotel.  There were several other people there, including (I think) Jody.  She took some sparklers which looked like long matches and passed them around, and everybody lighted them.  When they had gone out, I thought of my camera -- it would have made a pretty picture -- but there weren't any sparklers left.",Negative
"I was taking care of two young Asian children.  They were living in the same room and the younger boy was to move across the hall.  In the kitchen, juice was spilled.  My stuffed pig Albert was clean, but my stuffed ghost Jerome was not.  My mother's friend Jill Block was 'teaching' a class in the living room.  We were supposed to get up and discuss a certain given topic that we'd supposedly prepared for.  The first guy did, and I asked to go to the bathroom before I did mine.  When I came back, she already had the next going.  He was talking about numbers in tiger stripes.  Then I was going to do mine.  I'd decided to talk about life as three interlocking circles.

"I was with three of the characters from the TV show Ed. I was with Ed, Carol, and Molly. It wasn't on the show. The four of us were friends. It seems that maybe I was closest to Carol. The four of us were in a car going somewhere. Ed was driving and Molly was in the front seat with him. I was sitting directly behind him and Carol was behind Molly. Ed was talking about something that he did. None of us could believe that he had done that. I reached up and tousled his hair with both of my hands and said, You silly man. He ran his fingers through his hair. I was afraid that I had irritated him or made him mad - that he didn't like it that I tousled his hair. He didn't say anything though. Carol laid down in the backseat and put her head on my lap. I reached down to brush the hair out of her face and accidentally rubbed her face roughly or the wrong way. She jokingly said something to the others about me being rough. I also had a sore on the ring finger of my right hand. It was kind of inside where it would rub against the second finger. It was a big round thing. It was too large to be in that spot on a finger. I had been messing with it. It was almost as though it was a wart and I had been picking and pulling at it and I had maybe pulled it out myself. It hurt a little, but not that much, not as much as you would expect it too. I kept looking at it and thinking that I needed to go see a doctor about it. I don't remember actually talking about it.",Negative
"Scene laid in District Grocery Store on Rhode Island Ave. The proprietor was arranging a display of food in his window, and among other things there was a flat square tray, divided into several compartments, in which were several items, including about 7 or 8 tomatoes; one compartment with ice cubes; and another with a dingy dish rag and some dirty dish water. The proprietor has a small cardboard sign reading ""7c,"" attached to a sharpened wire, which he intends to stick in one of the tomatoes. He fears, however, that the sign will obscure people's view of some of the other articles on display, and asks me to go outside, look at the sign, and give him my opinion. I ask whether a sign is to be stuck into each tomato and he answers (somewhat impatiently) ""No, no, only one."" I therefore go outside, get down on my hands and knees on the cement sidewalk, and examine the display. (Only by thus prostrating myself can I properly judge the effect of the sign). My conclusion is that the sign, if properly placed, will not perceptibly obscure any other article -- in fact, it could be made to serve a useful purpose by largely concealing the dish rags and the dirty water which are more or less of an eye sore. I then go inside, intending to introduce my statement with the apothegm ""Every loss has its compensation"" and explain that though the sign may conceivably slightly obscure something in the window, covering of the dish water will more than compensate; in addition, all customers like to see the price of an article plainly shown, and here too the sing will act as an aid to salesmanship. I look around for the proprietor to tell him all this, even though it is clear that he is opposed to using the sign. He is now busy with a customer, and I am unable to find a convenient opening, and I debate myself whether or not to interrupt his conversation. It seems to me that it is proper for me to interrupt, as in cases of this kind it would be very unlikely that he would ask me for my opinion a second time -- i.e., custom decrees that I should speak my piece without additional request.  As I approach closer to him, I see that he is not the groceryman at all but Mr. Haas, the hardware man (the stout one of the 2 Haases). He is busy explaining to a customer how to repair a spray which the latter holds under one arm. The customer is a rather old man, judging by his scrawny, corded neck (I see him only from behind), but is spry enough. The spray consists of an egg shaped ""body,"" jet black in color, about size of a large watermelon; from one end extends a short rubber tube with some sort of a brass piece (?nozzle) at distal end. There is a ""fizzing"" sound, caused by the leakage of air and liquid through the end of tube, and I am concerned lest the liquid should squirt on to my clothes.",Negative

"I was at a dinner party. As we rose from the table a girl came to me, asking if I remembered her. I didn't but pretended to. We talked of former happenings and I walked with her diagonally across the green lawn. She asked where I was taking her and I said ""Oh, I'll take you back"" and we walked back to the crowd. They were going to the country club for bridge, but I was not asked to that part of the party. I reasoned that it was because they were all men. I wondered through the club grounds looking for someone with whom to play bridge but it was a man's club. I returned to the lanai and found the rest hadn't gone yet so I looked for mother. Found her going to an outdoor toilet. Ask why not seek accommodations inside but she said there were none. Someone told me she was sorry I had to go to star and couldn't go with them. It was raining. An earlier dream was about a job my husband had gotten for us both. It was some sort of chemical research for him. My job was not clear. I thought it was probably clerical or statistical.

"Gladys and I were walking along the corridor of a big building standing where U.S. Treasury is located (not Treasury Bldg). There were a good many double doors to pass through (as when going along corridor of Internal Rev. Bldg. paralleling 10th St). Gladys told me it was illegal to open both doors -- that is, north bound pedestrians were to open only the door to their right (east door) and south bound walkers the west door only. Once or twice I became confused as to which was proper door to open, and on these occasions Gladys said in a slightly impatient voice ""Well, go ahead."" As we left the building (on 15th St. side) we saw a snow ball battle in progress. Not clear who contestants were. On the sidewalk we met a Mr. Smith who had on a thread-bare overcoat; he insisted that I join him and his party in a meal, but I had an errand to do (or possibly an appointment) which would take me west of White House, maybe to Allies Cafe.

"Devil Dragon and Orange Moon  I'm at the pond near Armstrong High School with my friends Niles Zelling and Hilary Nano. We are there to do something with canoes; maybe trying out wood or plastic paddles. We are waiting for someone. We're down by the pond fishing. There are some little sunnies that don't bite my line. Hilary gets a bite and reels in a black bear cub! She lifts it up by the line. I'm going to cut the line. The bear starts eating its way up the line, so I cut it halfway up the pole. The bear falls to the ground when I cut it. It looks like it's in pain. I'm afraid the mother bear will come to help it, so I run away. I cross Home Avenue, as if I were at home, and as I do I look up. On an invisible plane above my house is the mother bear, pacing. I run in the alley of the block between Home and Next Avenues. There are dogs in cages that lunge towards me as I run by. They are all around me. There is a dragon. It is evil: the devil. It is flying out from an eerie orangish-colored full moon.

"The Fugitive  A young man is running away from police officers. Others may be running away. He runs through a yard, over a tall wooden fence, through the back yard, over bushes, and through more yards. Television news crews are covering the story. There is as much speculation that he is innocent as guilty. There are interviews with the running man's friends. One of his friends, a tall man with medium length dark brown hair, questions the man's innocence. The interviewer is a scrubbed clean upper middle class frat-boy-esque man. There is a remake of the scene. The fugitive may have hurt his back flipping over the fence. He may have a broken leg; police don't know. The fugitive could have gone between sparse hedges rather than jumping over them. I see the path he ran. I may be him. He outruns the others. Police may have calculated the man's running speed, in centimeters per second, from the remake of the scene. From this they can project how far he could be. The man is a fugitive! He runs through yards and streets. People chase him, and fall behind as he outruns them. He runs on a street. I see through his eyes. I may be he. There is a wooded area to my left. People come out of the area and point in the opposite direction, indicating the police have infiltrated the wooded area already looking for him, and that he would find no safety in the woods. Some people shake scolding fingers at the man. He (I) questions whether to keep running. It seems futile: the police are everywhere. I wonder if I should hide in a tree in the woods.

"I was in a mammoth, luxurious house. I was talking to a woman named Juliana, but she ran away after something had disturbed her. I think it was the doorbell ringing. I went upstairs to look for her with a tall, husky boy. We started opening strange doors, and I was so frightened that when I said something about it, he picked me up. Finally we opened the door to a huge bedroom with doors leading into every part of the house and out onto a beautiful terrace. All of a sudden Juliana tried to dash through the bedroom from one door to another, but we caught her before she could get away. Next, there was a very distinguished woman guest in the house. I tried to anticipate her needs, but she told me to get her linens. As I was looking for them in a hall filled with drawers and shelves, I came across numerous used and new toothbrushes. On one of the top shelves I saw a box-file with the numbers 60 and 604 directly below each other. Opposite the 604 were the words Sandra Gordon, very severe case. (I seemed to associate this with an admonishment I had received at my job a few days before.) I was rather surprised to see this, but I went on looking for towels.

"There were zombies. They were different though, some were fast, some just lay about, some were smart, some were crazy etc. Because of this people still called them people, instead of zombies. They could also open doors. I wandered into a house and there were some zombies walking around. Then there had been a large family there. They were running about and they were trying to guard the back door from them. Too many zombies were in though. Then I was there and I had a pole and a butcher knife. I stabbed them in the heart (they were killed from being stabbed in the heart). Some were harder than others so I had to slit the throat of one and stab him a heap of times. The house was small and I used this girl as a shield. I went to the back door and there were heaps of them. The girl screamed and slipped out, so I gave her a push and closed the door. Eventually, no-one else was around. I was closing and locking doors and turning off the lights. Then the house was different. It was big and I was with others. Some of it was very glassy. It was also night time. This black girl there was very bossy and she suggested we go outside to do something. Before we went I had locked all the doors. We went out and then we realized all the doors were locked and we couldn't get back in. It was a really nice house and it was pretty well designed. There were back lights everywhere and they were on. There were also buildings across the street, and some had lights on. We got in a car and drove through a brick wall of a different building across the street. We all climbed up and into a room on the second floor (hotel like). We sat on the bed, which was right at the wall. Some cars and motorbikes drove past. There was then a window where we had smashed through and it slid together and I was holding them together. I asked for someone to turn off the light but the black girl kept refusing.

I see connecting doors between rooms and remember this house is on the state line. Cars line up. One is going to drive through the connecting rooms and gets stuck or stopped and the next car screeches to a halt, nearly crashing, and the next and so on. There is a chain reaction pile up. Luckily no one really crashes. I am impressed. I go in to see what's the problem. These people are coming to buy the booze I can legally make on one side of the house and sell to the folks on the other side where it's illegal to make it. I go back into the living room, wanting to use the rooms more. I see an old file cabinet and look. The previous owners, old ladies, had their files in there. One of these days I need to clean it out.

"Roof Is Rotting  I'm at a rock climbing gymnasium with my classmate Doug and others. I tie the rope knot to hold me. I look on the wall for the best place to climb: the easiest with the most holds. My brother Wally arrives. He tells me to go straight up the middle. After looking for the right path, I climb straight up. The holds are thin aluminum-like holds. I make it 2/3 of the way up, where the roof meets the side of my home. I'm climbing on the side of my home in Oak Valley. I stop when I reach the roof, hanging on, putting my butt into the wall. I put my hand and foot in small door-like openings: holds. I don't climb on the roof because it's rotting. I easily tear off a piece of dead rotting wood, soggy and decaying. There are wooden steps running up to the side of the house to an entrance at the level where I am. I climb over and down, onto and over steps, to climb down the other side of them. The steps are rotting wood, with pieces missing. Some steps are decaying with rusty nails protruding from them. I carefully cross over this dangerous staircase to the other side where I'll climb down. I fall 15 or 20 feet into the soft leaves that have collected on the ground. Wally has not kept the rope that is holding me tight. I'm okay. Wally has big puffy green mittens for climbing. Doug let me use his chalk for my sweaty hands.

I think I am invited, but I don't want to go, even if that is the case.",Positive
"I was at work and on the phone talking to a travel agent. We were talking about airfare to somewhere for me. I don't remember where. Then he said it would have to be more expensive. I asked him why and he said, ""Because I need to pay for my office. It has big gates surrounding it."" And then there was this small earthquake. The travel agent said it must be very big in his city, but where I was didn't feel it very much. But then there was a huge earthquake and I was standing in a doorway, hoping that nothing would fall on me.",Positive

"I was in Rivertown. I visited the Minkus family. I met Zeanie, his mother and a granddaughter. Zeanie couldn't recognize me. I told him what house I lived in and I finally told him who I was. I said, ""It's a long time since I left here 38 years ago."" I talked with the granddaughter and to my surprise there were new brick homes built where the old homes were wrecked for the strip mining. I looked in surprise at the homes and thought where do the people work. Then I told them about Judy, but the way I told it, I was her brother and my mother had her. I said how beautiful and smart she is and the granddaughter said, ""It's only in your head,"" and she touched my forehead with her finger. I asked Zeanie where the Knetzer's went, and he said to Houston, Texas.",Negative
"I was at the office with Bill C. He asked me if I wanted to go to lunch and discuss things. I said, sure. He headed out the door, but I went into my office to get my suit jacket. He turned around and saw I wasn't behind him. He asked if I was coming. I said yes. I had something very large in my hand but I don't know what it was. I put my jacket on and headed out the door. I'm now at a post office. I see a man named Scott. I knew him but don't know who it is in waking life. He's a new member of CRHP XII. We were exchanging pleasantries, etc. Helen J comes in. I act very excited to see her. I approach her, give her a hug, we chat. I turned around and said, Oh, have you met Scott? She said she had not. I told her that he is our newest CRHP XII member. I introduced them. They were now chatting and a couple more of my CRHP sisters came in. I jokingly asked if someone had made arrangements for CRHP to meet at the post office. Anne C was one of the ones who had just come in. I don't know who the others were. I gave her a hug and chatted with her a bit. She looked different than she does in waking life.",Positive

"I was at St. Joe. I don't know who I was or who I was with. We had started some kind of a carnival I think. We were selling tickets from the kitchen. This is very odd. It's as though we were at the old house in the kitchen, sitting at the table selling tickets. Yet, it is as though it was outside as well. People would come up and hand us their money and then go on to the carnival. It seems that maybe it was a penny a person to enter. I don't anything about the carnival or anything like that. When we first set up to start selling the ticket. We had a money tray with rolls of coins. At the last minute I thought we should have two trays so I was quickly trying to divide the money for another tray. We were only doing this for a couple of hours in the evening. We had decided that we would quit selling tickets at 8 o'clock. I looked at the clock the last time and it was 8:39 and I was cleaning up. I was wondering where everyone had gone. I guess there were members of the family that should have been there helping me. I just kept busy cleaning up. I was imagining someone saying something to me and I would respond, well, there was stuff to do so I was keeping busy. There was something about something sitting there that needed to be cleaned up. It had been sitting there for a long time. I was at the kitchen sink and doing dishes or rinsing out things that had a lot of food or something leftover in them.",Positive

"Arguing About Showers  I'm at Brimson with four or five people. We are riding bicycles. My friend Nate Nelling is there. We are biking north on the path by Old Main, and then past Social Science Hall. There are people coming towards us, on bike or on foot. As we pass, one of them says something about us taking up the middle of the path. I shrug off the comment, thinking, ""Fuck off"". My dad is there. A bearded man I don't know points him out to me and says that he was at the Tea Hall dormitory looking for me. I go back to the dormitory. I store the bicycle I am on. I have a door key but I drop it, and am without. I am on my way upstairs to see my dad. The hall advisor says she won't require 12 meals to be eaten with her, only 10 meals. The stairs are square, and rising. I pick up pennies. A woman comes over and blatantly asks me out. It is my old classmate Jerome Michaels' girlfriend. I say to her, ""What about Jerome?"" Another woman comes over and the two women fight. I sneak away up the stairs. My friends Esther Thurman and Jana Green are arguing over who is going to shower with me: they both want to. There are people watching. I say that neither is going to shower with me. I enter the shower alone with my towel and close the door. The shower stall is short, and I easily see over the top.

"I recall a dream prior to being awoken where I was talking to a man and I knew this man and his daughter. His daughter was young, maybe 11 or 12 years old, possibly a year younger or older. I can't recall. Anyway, it seems that I offered to give her a ride home from wherever we were. I can't recall right now. The man was standing in front of me talking and I was noticing how he was dressed. The full picture of the dream is becoming not distorted, but just less clear, harder to define. I do recall though that through the weirdness of dreams, one minute I was offering this girl a ride home, and the next thing I was like a student, just a student being lectured by this fellow, and the girl was sitting next to me. It seemed we were at some meeting or something. I can't really say what. I was to give her a ride home after the meeting or whatever it was we were there for. Then I recall being obligated to stay at this person's house for the night. This is where my recall is not very clear, and it is really difficult to say why or what I did or exactly what happened. This dream was recalled after Max had left. I was no able to recall this dream while Max was in the room for some reason or another. Upon being awoken, there seems to be like a small mental block developed so that recall is much more difficult even when just closing the eyes and trying to, or just waiting for the dream to possibly reenter the conscious state, but as soon as Max left, and I was attempting to return to sleep, the dream which I had prior to wakening became clear again, not to the extent that I could recall the full dream, enough of it to know that this was what I was dreaming before awakening. The dream did no seem really plausible. One minute seemed to be in the past, and the next minute right at the present. It was vivid, just average, or maybe a little bit better. Recall is being like I might have stated earlier, well, but it didn't recall the full meaning or just even the full dream, just the main portion of it. I do think I saw some color or I attempted earlier to mention I was noticing he way he was dressing. Now I can't. It's distorted, as I say, exactly the way he was dressing, but it did seem as if it might have been in color or else I was just thinking of it as certain colors to my own taste, so to speak. The dream did not seem to take long, maybe just a few minutes or even shorter. As I said, it didn't seem completely plausible. This dream did not seem to be a take off of any experience that I have had in the last day or two. It seemed to be just as if I was meeting an acquaintance from the past and this happened in the past or even right now at the present. This is definitely the dream that I was having on being awoken for the second time this morning. I was just not able to recall it when being awoken, but as I was getting ready to go to sleep, it returned to my consciousness, my awareness of having dreamt the dream , and I was able to recall a portion of that dream.",Positive

"A competition is being held for the purpose of determining who can break or shatter glass into the most beautiful geometric pattern. One of the contestants, a young boy, walks up on the stage and prepares to break a plane of glass standing beside him. For dramatic effect, he plays a musical flourish on a harmonica. Somehow the harmonica, which is tied to a string hanging from the ceiling, slips out of his control. The harmonica swings like a pendulum and strikes the pane of glass, much to the boy's horror. But the outcome of this accident is lucky, for the pane breaks first into four perfect quarters, followed by each quarter breaking into three pieces of equal size. The audience gasps in awe at this presumably winning entry in the competition.",Positive

We are way at the top. He has a small baby in a pink sling strapped to his chest. He's going to take care of her for a while. I think that's neat. I look down and get scared. I say, ""Ginny, how do we get down?"" She says impatiently, ""You climb down."" ""How?"" I cry out. She points to a spiral tower with lots of coffee cup-like handles all around it. ""Just step on them and go around and around until you're down."" ""I can't."" I wait. She looks at me disapprovingly, like I'm acting like a baby. So I try.

There were also a couple of men there - they were probably security guards. Of the three, one was very pretty, and had dark hair. Terry said ""I'll go with her"" pointing out the pretty one. He and the girl disappeared off, leaving me with the other two. I said ""OK, I'll pay for the Blonde one"". So I paid and we were led to a room. She led me in, and said ""I've just got to do something, I'll be back in a moment"". After a long time I went back out to the lounge because she didn't come back.

We have a blanket that is underneath us. It might be the quilt that Grandma Ramona gave my brother Wally. We have sex for a long time. I change positions a few times. A car pulls up to the side of the road. We quickly leave. We go up to the porch of Stein's house. Then go inside and upstairs. A lady is there. We as her, ""Can we hump here?"" She says yes. We go in a room. Annie leaves the room for a moment. She says she might lose her erection. I am kind of confused, but figure it might be something to do with her arousal. We have sex some more. She is wearing the red sundress with the red and white flowers that she has. The lady comes back. We hear her and get dressed. The landlord barges into the room, but we are dressed. One of us says, ""See; they're not humping."" The lady went to get the landlord. Annie and I walk out of the room. There is a baby in a crib. I touch its cheek, and say how cute it is.

There was a long line to buy tickets, but it was moving fast. I didn't know what to do so I asked if we had to buy them now and they said no. I walked past and then I realised I was supposed to, but I'd already gone. Someone asked me what my dog was called and I said Rover. Spaceman was climbing on me on the floor. Morena Baccarin stroked him and accidentally touched my face. I posted a status on Facebook about whether I should get her autograph. Some random person commented saying 'why don't you make the decision yourself' and a long comment. Nicholas Brendon had a starshaped piercing. I was hanging with them. I was trying to find an ATM and asked Morena but she didn't know. Someone gave me a stamp. James Masters was at his booth signing stuff. Nicholas Brendon had to leave, so he was replaced with Matt Morrison who joined us. I left to find an ATM and found one backstage. There was a horse and I said 'do you own a horse? I disconnect'. I opened a door and it moved and looked more like a pony. I said the horse escaped and they chased after it. There was a shop and a black woman swiped a key card and got money out.",Negative

I give away a big box on my table stand next to my bed to Ellie's friend. I take three or four empty tape cassette boxes out of it first. There is dust on everything. I go into another room and feel something in my right ear. I pull on it. It's a dental floss string. I pull and pull. I can feel it inside my head. There is lots of ear wax on the string. I wonder how I managed to have left dental floss in my ear, but at last I'm getting my ear cleaned! The floss sticks to the wall and bits of dead leaves stick to it. I'm back in the bedroom and I look out the window and say to Ellie, ""Look, here's lots of wood bits I can use."" I see shingles and pallets, etc. stacked up outside.

My old bedroom is ugly, cluttered and old (see drawing in dream book). I see a fat woman and her kids cleaning one bedroom. I see lots of makeup jars and things on a dresser all dusted and tidy. I wonder out loud who cleaned this and how she's going to get paid. This concerns the woman who did it and thinks I'm to pay for it. In the next room I exclaim, ""Oh, look! A washer."" I won't have to use the old one outside and wonder if I should use this one. It really isn't mine. In the next room I see a closet filled with pretty little dresses, shiny satin material, shades of blue, sequined halter tops and I really like these dresses and wish I could wear them, but they would not fit. They are for a small, petite, slim person. I see a door and open it, and see the dining room table all laid out. I shut the door and see a small card on the wall. It's printed and says ""Compliments should (or) sound Dwight."" He's the one that owns the dresses and stuff. I think, ""There should be a comma between sound and Dwight."" I assumed Dwight is his first name. The next room has a refrigerator. I open it and smell the odor of a fridge left too long and see a few food items like butter. Each room had a made bed in it.

One woman in a lovely evening dress comes up to the woman owner of this place and says that in regular life, she can't meet men who she likes. She doesn't expect it to be any different here. I watch out the window as she, another woman and a man are climbing up a large rock. They are in long 1920's evening gowns. The woman and the man seem to be liking each other. They are attracted. The other woman is walking with a large furry black and white spotted cat in her arms. It is a pleasant scene. The woman owner is happy the two people met and are going to fall in love.",Positive
"My wife and I had decided to buy a house in the city where I go to graduate school . We looked in the paper and now went out to look at the first place that was advertised. We went into the place and looked around. It had several bedrooms and was an older frame house, but it was fairly nice. It had about an acre and a half of land (unable to understand). There was a factory in back at the end of the yard. It didn't go with the house. There were a couple of garages that did go with the house. They had second stories that were filled with supplies and waste products from this factory. I thought it would be nice to have the garages. The man who owned the house went over and talked to the man who owned the factory, and he said they would have them torn down so they wouldn't interfere with the view. I didn't like the idea of losing the garages, but the man convinced me that they were so rickety that it wouldn't be a good idea to use them and they couldn't be moved in their present condition. So we went back into the house. The man showed me a copy of the form I would have to sign to buy it. I read it over. Then I handed it to my wife to read. It suddenly occurred to me as I was reading it over that whether it was a good buy or not, we couldn't possibly afford the purchase price of this house, which was $30,000. I said so to my wife and the man seemed disappointed, since it seemed before we were actually going to buy it. I became very firm about it. Actually we didn't have any money and where could we get $30,000? We couldn't pay more than $25 per month and at that rate it would take us 61 years to pay off the house. So we told the man we'd think about it, but we didn't think we'd be able to. We drove off looking at the address of the 2nd house we wanted to look at and hoping it was a smaller place. We really didn't need three bedrooms and things like that.",Negative

She has my books under her arm and I'm concerned that she's going to steal them. I watch her closely. We get to a house and go in. It's time to clean up. I ask her to help put away the food. She balks and complains. I don't start work until I see that she has done her share and then I start doing it too. She put lots of things in the wrong place and I correct it. The man watches all this and as I'm washing dishes, he starts to talk to me. He says, ""He worked in Louisiana, do you know what that was like?"" I said, ""Ya, bugs, heat, etc."" He tells me about getting malaria. His feet were too short for the first 8 years of his life.",Negative

"I saw a boy who looked familiar.  Blonde flat top.  Reminded me of Jamie back in second grade.  The boy approached me and confirmed my suspicions; this was Jamie's younger brother.  He showed us pictures of Jamie, who had grown up to look rather nice.  His face was a bit longer and tanned.  Jamie had given his brother something to give to us, two little pop-up cards.  One showed an image, motion, like from TV, of him, his brother, and his father at a rocky area, like in the Stone Age.  In the other, we got a small live frog and a mouse.  They were mine, I guess, but I let my brother Stuart look after the frog.  The mouse got loose when we were trying to put them back in the container (card?).

I was at dads on my computer. I had gone back to play Sims 3 but hadn't yet. I had been there for hours but hadn't bothered. I went to the lounge room and played the Wii.

There were two master bedrooms and two normal ones. One of the normal rooms had a bathroom next to it and I wanted it. The other one was bigger so I hoped Ezra would take it.

I also remember talking too much (not really too much maybe, just lots more than everybody else combined). I'm on a computer, in a building that looks a bit like a bar, on the QRS campus. Someone online (or maybe even ""physically,"" dream physically) lets me know she ""needs something"". I don't remember what it is, except that it's a file for her computer. I find a game installed on the UNIX server, and I realize what she wants would be in the game. Next, I'm in my cellar, except there are about 4 computer terminals along the wall with people at some of them. I see someone is online and gets off just as I log on. Now one of the computers is empty, and I see that the person (I'm not sure who it was) I wanted to talk to had literally ""left the room"". I'm disappointed.

The only thing was the golden chicken was a mean old pecker. She would peck people. And I think the other white chicken was too. It was kind of hard to tell the difference between the old white and brown and the new white and brown. And then I dreamt that I had had a baby. I wasn't sure if had a baby or a baby doll, but I was singing to it. Or I just remember sort of telling somebody that I was singing to a baby. I couldn't remember if I was singing ""Brahms Lullaby"" or ""La La Loo."" But then I was at school and I was in English class, but first I was waiting to get into English class and there was like this thing in the hallway that was like a steering wheel. It was green and it would say if you turn it, the alarm will sound. So I had to get away from that one. The college rep person was there and a few other students were there following me to English class because they needed to get there too. And there was like, I told them I'm usually very leery of red things because red represents seeing an alarm, but this time it was green for some reason. So we got into English class and we were kind of sitting there listening to this college rep guy advertising I think he was talking about the State University and how great it is and how great their scholarships are, and, ""If you drop out, we'll hold your scholarship for ten years and if you come back, we'll still give it back to you."" And I was r_____ there and I was looking through this book he gave me, and while I was [laugh] -- well, this is the funny part -- while I was sitting there looking at this book of scholarship stuff, I started to get a little nervous and a little afraid because I was thinking of the song I was singing to the baby and I was also thinking about how we were calling ourselves Mamaloo, Papaloo, Babyloo, Chickenloo and Roosterloo.

There was a book which was full of Heroes pictures and there were lots of Milo Ventimiglia. Calvin was next to me and Samantha was sitting on my other side. We had a quiz later to remember the names that everyone picked. Calvin's name was Nubu. I tasted this wine whose name was the name I'd picked and it was really hot.

An open door led to a restaurant and a waitress heard my remark and agreed. We go into another room and Lydia is upset. She says a man had just had a heart attack and had fallen forward onto a chest of drawers, badly marking the wood and Doug will be upset! I am shocked she had witnessed a death and turn to see this mark, but it's so tiny I can barely see it. I try to soothe her and am annoyed she's so upset about Doug's reaction.

I look up and suddenly notice a magnificent range of mountains, lush green and wild. I say, ""You really do have a beautiful view."" I then see quite large people mountain climbing with ropes, some throwing themselves off the mountain and looking terrified and then the rope catching them so they were safe. I say I'd not like to do that. Then we go for a walk by the raging river, all brown and roiling. As I near it, I have to lay down because I feel afraid I'll lose my balance and fall in. We move away and Lydia says it's about ready to do a loop wave and might flood the house. I say, ""Your house gets flooded?"" She says ""Yeah, sometimes."" Later I get in my van, but before we can leave, I must empty the water from a vacuum cleaner-like thing. I open the sliding door and pour the water from the hose to the curb.

Second, instead of having a globe shaped abdomen like normal spiders, it had a giant rectangular box. This disgusting thing was almost enough to wake me up. I drifted halfway up out of the dream (long enough to register the spider as a dream) and sank back down into it. Now a bee was crawling around in my right shoe.

We were at a petrol station and there was a list of places and I realized the train to downtown came here so we waited for it.",Negative
"Money questions, how silly. I work for the Forest Service and am in a bed on a high platform. As I try to get up, I realize that there is a huge drop off if I take that first step and I could fall down for miles into the trees. I try to place my foot carefully, but then notice if I get out on the other side of the bed, the platform floor is there and it is safe. So I hop over to the safe side and get out. The new recruits are here and are asking a lot of questions about money. I laugh at their myopic concern about money when it isn't even the issue and someone says or I think ""You did that too when you first started."" Then I go get some clothes that are in a pile. I take off my nylons and a garter belt and start to put on a dress. I exclaim, ""Yes! I am a woman,"" like I'd somehow forgotten that. I put on some ugly, conservative pants (polyester) and rethink if I want to wear that.",Negative
"Writing Time  I'm with my housemate Norman Noman, his girlfriend Sunny Pile, and my dad. We seem to be near Golden Acres or Goldenshire Golf Course in Oak Valley.

Norman has taken a lot of coins from my green ceramic change jar to buy alcohol. Something happens with Sunny and her friend. I may do something with them.

"It was in the street in the middle of the day, but it was dark. And me and all the people in my grade that I hang out with - boys and girls - were fighting like boxing in the streets. Then we would go back to school. Then the next minute everyone was at my house eating chicken and it kept switching off like that. All the people in it were my friends, 16, 17. The people weren't really talking. The only thing I can recall being said was, ""Let's go eat chicken.""",Negative
"Smoking Cigarettes  I have a green pack of cigarettes. My friend has a pack too. There are 12 in a pack. I smoke one. I don't inhale at first, but then I do inhale.

"There was-a white, nylon windbreaker that was hanging on a chair, almost as if on display. It was of an old style, maybe from the 1970s or 8Os and of a generic cheap quality. I noted that I liked it a lot, but attributed it as being a little too feminine on account of the color. I thought it would look attractive on one of my two female housemates, and decided to suggest it to them.",Positive
"Someone's dog had killed a sheep. The people who owned the sheep decided to kill the dog. Mom and I drove them to the place (they were friends of ours or something) and we stayed behind. We had a poodle dog and called it to make it follow us. We went back to the car and drove to the people's house just around the corner. There was a black lady and we told her they were killing their dog. We brought back the dead dog and sheep and put them together. I was sad. Then someone peed on their lawn, which was covered in snow and it all turned yellow.",Negative

I had learned that one of my neighbors had a cleaning woman that was a, maybe even two of them, good and charged $83 per cleaning. Actually I think I talked to the neighbor first to see if she would tell me about her and tell me how much she charges. I was telling one of my other neighbors because I thought that was fairly reasonable. But then I think I said I knew someone else who charged less than that. Somehow though I was talking to a cleaning person, or thinking about talking to a cleaning person, to find out if there was a way that I could have her clean and it would be less money per cleaning or if I could afford to have her come just once a month.",Positive

"River Fishing Scandal  I'm going fishing with my mom, an old lady, and a young man. We are going to fish on the Main River. It is evening. I pull the boat into the water, rather than backing it in. I'm not sure which vehicle I'm driving. There is a tree in the way, so I decide to back the boat in. When we put the boat in, the landing is filled with huge rocks. My mom wants to be back by 6:00 am so I figure we have a good two hours to fish. I go and park the trailer. I drive down the road a ways and find a driveway I can turn around in. I think that the mosquitoes probably won't be bad because of something, but it is evening so they'll be worse than usual. We lift the boat in, scraping it on the rocks. The anchor is hanging out. There is a dammed up stream leading out to the river that we travel in before getting to bay on the river. It is like we are portaging. There are broken oars all along the river and in the dam. I step on the dam-made of intertwined sticks and leaves and oars-to pull the boat through. There are many boats out in the bay. It is packed. There is good smallmouth bass fishing. We travel out of the stream. There is a man driving a nice boat with a trolling motor on it, going the opposite way. . There is an office in the bay. I am in it with three other men. They are doing something corrupt. Two of the men leave. I talk with the third man. A truck pulls up. I am not in the office now. A woman in the truck has her boy get out and run something important into the office. I hide and try to watch the boy.  I'm in my mom's bedroom at home looking out the window to where I think the boy will be. I am going to climb out and intercept the boy. I have my leather jacket on. As I am about to climb out, the lady that I thought was in the truck runs back to the truck. I grab her. Then the boy comes along. Another boy, who may be me, shoots this boy.",Negative
"There is a demonstration going on across the street from my home. At first I think it has to do with existentialism, xenophobia, and the treatment of foreigners. But it is something commercial.

"I was back at Bancroft Middle School, kind of, and I was in a stairwell, and there must've been ten alarm boxes all on the same wall. And some administrator was saying that when the alarm goes off, these doors locked, and then you were stuck in there for the next half an hour. People would tell me that the doors close to prevent the fire from spreading, but I was afraid they'd lock, too. I also dreamt that I got caught shoplifting that time, and I dreamt that I had stuffed some pens and scissors in my socks and walked out, and one white person and two black people were not going to let me pass. And I dreamt that a police officer came and put me in handcuffs and then I woke up. Never experienced this for real, not sure why I'd dream it. The next one I don't even remember.",Negative

I also saw Eugene and some others at a table. I couldn't find the proper way out, but I managed to get out. It was hard to walk out to the road. There were two buses on the other side of the road but they both left. I waited for the next ones, and a huge crowd gathered. We waited for the traffic to slow down so we could cross. I text Mom to say that I didn't have my SmartRider. This guy came with a gun and said to give him our phones. I said I didn't have mine. The girl next to me gave him a wallet instead. I pulled out a $5 note and said it was all I had. He told me to stick my hand in my other pocket and I pulled out a 20c coin. The guy now looked like Eli Roth, but was some other famous guy. I was talking to Ezra on MSN over my phone and said ""I'm being held up, go away"". He kept pressuring me to give him stuff. He told us to go, so we all went across the street and he tried to push me into the traffic. I waited at the bus stop. It finally came. I found my SmartRider in my bag.

"Mom went off to someone's house and Ezra and I were stuck in the car. He decided to have a go driving and was going over the speed limit. He turned corners wide and wouldn't stop in time at lights, which I thought was the 'same thing as me'. He stopped and I said I'd drive now because it was safer. I pulled out of a driveway then turned the car. I was going up the street, fast and wouldn't brake. I turned left and then took the next right, and then I couldn't brake or control the car and it crashed into a house into the lounge room. This lady came out yelling at me. I said the brake didn't work. The window was smashed and there were two kids inside the room. I went inside and she yelled at me still and I yelled ""It's not as if I went out tonight thinking 'Oh, I might go crash into a house',"". Ezra traded lawyer details and ours was on a poster with contact information and his name was Christopher Leeley, or something. There were pictures of him too.

He hangs up on me. I feel terribly hurt and rejected, numbed by the pain of it. I turn and people are cheerfully calling out to me to join the party. I try to respond to them but it is very difficult. I go out to the back yard and something about Charla only having her diapers on. I see her and see she has an outfit of clothes on and looks fine. I comment that she is fine, perfectly and properly clothed. Her ""mom"" and ""dad"" want to stay at the party and I want to leave, to be alone. I tell them they can stay as long as they want.

"I live in a little house on a suburban street with my family - I've got at least one brother, and Phylicia Rashad (from the Cosby Show) seems to be our mother. It's a very cold winter morning, and there's been a freeze overnight. I go outside to see how things are and I discover the driveway, which slants downward a little to the street, is frozen solid. A smooth, slick sheet of ice. I kneel down by it and give it a rap - it cracks a bit, underneath. Looking around, I can see the ice on everything - no cars are moving on our street but it's still very early. Farther, where I can see the bigger cross-streets and bits of main road, there are cars moving, and pretty normally. I go back inside and tell ""Mom"" that we can't get out of our driveway, at least I'm not going to try to drive on it. (I don't come in the front door - I go around to the back and come in through a sort of side room to the kitchen - maybe it's a laundry or storage room, there are a lot of things stacked around, probably some gardening equipment, outside things.

"I don't remember the start of the dream...it may have been connected in the following dream somehow.  I went to Myst, and down into the large elevator tree.  I couldn't find the button to send it back up, but there was a wire hanging out.  I touched the two ends of the wire and that activated it, so it started going back up.  I got out at ground level, but there was a little glow of white between the two wires when I got out.  Several moves upwards and the elevator exploded.  I guess I died...the dream was a 'redo'.

"To begin with, I dreamed that my father had been killed while working on the railroad. I seemed to be crying and could feel the choking in my throat. The scene changed and I was in C--. My aunt (40 yrs. old) told me that she and my uncle (58) were getting a divorce. I asked her why and she said that she knew he was still in love with his former wife. The scene changed again, and I was uptown in P-- with my cousin, the daughter (17 yrs.) of the couple written about above. We were crossing the main street and narrowly missed being hit by an automobile. Dream ended. Interpretation Not long ago I had a letter saying that lightning struck the freight car on which my father was on, and by pure luck he was not killed. That probably accounts for the first part of my dream, as I have thought about the incidence quite a bit. My uncle and aunt did talk of divorce once, and it is true that he has never gotten over the love for his first wife. It was probably in my mind because the day before this dream I had spoken of these relatives to another person. The day before this dream, another girl and I were almost hit by an automobile. Here it was my cousin, probably because of just dreamlng about her mother and father. Answers to questions 2. It was a morbid dream.

I'm manager of something of my department and I've been given a lot of work to do. There are catalog requests piling up. Tons of them - some involved getting outakes too. There's no way I can do all this. I should have kept checking the catalog request box.  I have lunch with Christine and Jen. We're at a pier on the ocean. I decide to go swimming since I'm so overwhelmed. Christine is swimming too - with goggles on. We swim along the pier. The water is blue with leopard stripes of green where it's shallow. White sand on the bottom. I put my feet down and the sand is really soft and smushy. I dont like it cause I feel like there are things buried in there.  Swimming along I see Christine standing and I go over and stand too. The surface is dry feeling and looks crackly. I automaticaly sense that something is wrong with this picture. I put Christines goggles on and look underwater. It's hard to tell but I think that I see a huge HUGE fucking snake. I scramble out of the water and stand there looking at the ocean floor. All of a sudden I see a chunk of the floor lift up and a big brown eye open. It is a snake! Holy shit! His head is a big as two people. We all go running down the boardwalk screaming and warning people. The snake moves along with us.  Some how the snake is now in a box the size of a pint of milk.

"Breaking Open A Clam  I'm with my housemate Stephen Ramos and friends Niles and Tim Zelling. We seem to be camping or at a cabin. We're at a small store to get some supplies and fun stuff. Stephen and I look at large packages of water balloons: 20, 100, 500, or 1000 in a package, costing from $3 to $120. Some of the balloons are very large and are too big for water balloons, I think. An old man with a shopping cart is on a beach. I walk up and look at a newspaper in his cart. He comes over, thinking I'm stealing it. I was just showing Stephen a photograph on the front page of a man catching a trout on Lake Erie. It's the fishing opener. I say that it's a trout, but at second glance it looks like a bass. I walk out into the water with my pants on, going knee deep. I see a bunch of clams, some of which are very large. I pick one up. It looks old, having a lot of algae and growth on its shell. Its shell is large: ten inches long, and six to eight inches wide. I grab it with both hands and smack it hard against a rock. I look at it and see that the shell hasn't cracked. I flip it over and smack the other side hard. The shell still doesn't crack, but it's easy to open. I open it and rip the foot out of it and throw it down on the floor.

"I was somewhere and Mom was there. I needed her to say something for me for some court-like thing. The Doctor (Doctor Who, as David Tennant) came somewhere and went to these men and he said to buy him ""three drinks, no, two"" because they thought he was crazy the last time. He then passed out.",Positive
I watched this movie and I found this snake lolly thing in the dining room. It was supposed to be 'dangerous' to put on but I did anyway. I was then in my bed. Tigger and Mittens were cuddling. I fed Tigger the snake lolly and then she was vomiting it under the table.,Positive
"Russia took over our country and they started to work on us, making slaves of us and taking away everything. Grandpa was prisoner, was to be executed in three weeks. I went out and I noticed I was followed (shadowed). I thought I would get around a corner and fly away. I found out I was might. I could fly, make myself disappear, could not be shot and I was might. I started to work on the communists. I pushed them off walls, got them by the feet and whipped them on the ground and threw them at a distance. I was tried to be killed by their gunner. He tried to shoot me, but couldn't see me. I roared above them and they all fled. The gunner and his partner hid from fright. I saw their feet stick out from the hiding place. I yanked him out and whipped him on the ground and killed him. I was master of them and they were sure because they were afraid of me. A woman was denouncing our government. I got hold of her and tossed her across the street.",Negative
"I was in math class. We were in a different classroom than the normal one, and my teacher asked me to pass out these papers, but he only gave me three papers. I started to pass them out, then went back to his desk and told him I needed more papers. He said he gave me enough and I was like, you only gave me three. So he said to go sit down. We were watching a movie in class so I sat down in a seat that wasn't even mine. Then the bell rang and I went to science.",Positive
"I could hardly forget this dream as it involved the young lady I was extremely interested in at the time. The dream was merely this. I apparently was standing on the street, and she approached me. Very passively she walked up to me, and without any greeting she said that she would like me to see her engagement ring -- extending her arm as she spoke. As I looked at the ring, I couldn't even feel involved by sentiment. In the dream I was at that time concerned by the fact that I was not overcome by emotion nor was I angry.",Negative
"I am in a 1955 kind of car and it gets stuck in a deep mud hole. One of my friends named William gets out of the trunk and helps us get out of the hole. We were headed for escape from some bad guys and the bad guys had directed us to this road. So we decide to back up and take another route. We go cross country, like hilly scrub brush country, and come to the top of a ridge and have to drive down switchback trails to get to the valley floor. I disguise myself as a Mexican young man so the bad guys can't trail us as easily. I hang out with the men, but they start to wonder why I don't go after the ladies. Am I gay? So I make a date with a pretty young lady and put my arm around her and we go away together, but then I tell her the truth that I am a woman and ask her to keep the secret. She does. Later, the car is now a hearse, or at least it used to be. William hangs out in the back section.",Negative
"Late Night Barbeque  I'm at my dad's old house with my brother Wally, friends Nat Miller, Sarah Reed, and another woman. It is nearly 2:00am. I'm watching television on the couch. I talk to Wally, who is on the porch. We exchange some odd glances and some short comments. We may have a cookout tonight. I talk to him about what we'll need for it. The television show ends at 2:00am. Nat and I get up from the couch. Sarah has left but may return later. The other woman may ask if we need to go to the store. I say Nat and I will go and get charcoal and food for a barbeque. Wally says that it's going to be difficult staying up until 3:00am for this barbeque and then waking up at 6:00am. I say I won't be getting up at six, but sleeping until 1:00pm! The others will have to get up. I walk outside. From the window, Nat says that it looks like a tornado/funnel cloud. I look westward. The sky is light colored, yellow and stormy. I think it would be a good idea to light the barbeque before we go to the store so it's ready when we return. I look for the grill. I find short small round grill next to the base of the tree near the shop. I pick up the square grill grate that is on the ground. I hear a voice in the shop, but notice no light is on there. I walk over to the shop door with the thick iron grate as a weapon. I kick the door, making a loud thud sound to scare the intruders. My dad and the other woman emerge. They're going to light the grill. I thought they were intruders.",Negative
"I was at school and I had computing. There was a big chair and a high computer somewhere. Eugene did something and him, Darius and Jeremiah went down this tunnel. Calvin, Evelyn and I were sitting on a long bench. I was sitting on the edge, then Calvin, then Evelyn. Darius sat next to Evelyn and kissed her. Calvin and I were trying not to laugh. We had all done stuff in a movie or something. There was some party thing and I was trying to find photos of Eugene. I was on this Sims 2 website and I found this guy who had made a Sim of Dmitri, but it had pink hair. He liked cricket and I was thinking that Eugene likes cricket.",Positive
"No Bucks And No Bulls  I see some deer, including big does with fawns. I see many deer, about 10. I see some moose, including big cow moose with twin and triplet calves. I don't see any bucks or bulls. I seem to be near Carter School, near Delivery Avenue on the east side of the school. A cow moose and some calves walk right by us in the alley! An Asian man with three small children walks by. The children are the moose calves, and the Asian man may be the cow moose. There is a white goat that wanders over near me. It has curled gray horns. It has a five-gallon bucket of feed that it eats. It may have grabbed the bucket itself, or a man may have grabbed the bucket for the goat. The man is from Regions College. Two Australian kick boxers walk by in the alley. One has pads on, and the other is practicing on the padded man. The man from Regions says to me, ""You don't see that (the Australian kick boxers) much."" I agree, but there have been more in recent years.",Positive

"We were in Russia. A young fellow came there and the Russian Boxing champ was Wallace Berry, our former movie star (deceased). They wanted this fellow to fight Berry, but he heard about six assistants helping him. They would hold him and Wallace would punch him. They finally knocked this fellow down into the water and he was groggy, so Berry challenged him himself. I looked at Berry and he was a big fat bully, very fat. When the man walked out of the water, Wallace punched him and knocked him back into the water. We were looking thru unbreakable glass. The American came near the glass and punched it, breaking it. I could see the cracks in it. Ann and I went into a restaurant. She sat down and I went to see what menu they had. I couldn't see anything, so I asked a waitress what they had. She pointed at the menu signs hanging on some string. One was hanging sideways, so I had to twist my head. I came against the young waitress's breast so I put my head on her bosom and I looked at the menu. It was a Chesapeake steak. My dad was getting a job for himself. He was hired and it was a very hard job at the Chevrolet plant.",Negative
"I'm in some western town. It seems that the west is still full of cowboy types, but they're more beatniks now and instead of bucking broncos, the latest fad is flying. I can see these guys flying around and it's like they have bicycles, but some way of balancing them so that they can come down and maneuver various ways with their arms. I don't see the bicycle though. One of them, he's sort of gliding around and then he very, very softly lands in a net that he apparently has laid out between some telephone wires. It seems like Audrey and I are visiting this place and it's temporary. She's got some kind of a new, not a contour sheet, but a contour bedspread, and I'm helping her put this thing on, and she's saying, ""Watch you don't break it or stretch it too much."" This all seems to be one place and then I'm out in this town again, sort of like a farmyard, or a farm town. It's strange because it's so modern. It has all these flying things and yet the john is an outdoor john. The bathroom is outside, and I want to go to the bathroom, so I go and open the door and the first thing my eyes focus on two urinals off in the corner, dirty as hell, and there are bugs, what look like bugs crawling all around in front of them and I say to myself, ""The hell with this."" This all takes place in a split second. Before I can even turn around, a bat comes flying out and brushes my head as he goes by. I think that's when I woke up. I said I don't think I want to sleep anymore. It's like it was in the recent past in California, but Audrey was with me, but she wasn't there, and also the feeling is the feeling that I have here. That it's very temporary now, and I won't be here too long. It's part of the dream. Audrey was going to paint the walls some color, and I thought that was a good idea, but now it seemed like half the stay was already gone and she hadn't done it yet, so I figured, ""Well, no sense doing it."" The hotel room was like the one in Paris. The reason all these folk singers were gathered in this one town it turned out was that was a place where someone had discovered like a whole stock of folk songs. It's like it was the Comstock Lode of folk singing. It was really like there was a mine somewhere. There was a sign pointing to it. It wasn't a mine. It was a place where a lot of folk songs had been written. There's almost something magical about it, like all these kids were here on a pilgrimage.",Positive
"I Eat Off The Ground  I'm at a gathering that is later a church service. There are several groups of people there. I stand apart from these groups, separate. I'm waiting for something.

My high school classmates Donald Dilson, Todd Warden, and Sonya Nittles are there. I'm at a church service outside in my back yard. My grade school classmate Patrick Bergman is there, as are my friend's parents Elliot and Eleanor Teavor. I stand apart from the others. As I go up for communion I may be eating something: wolfing down the last swallow. I drop the host on the ground. Father Vance Brock is presiding, and he says to me, ""We don't eat off the floor in the 20th century."" I pick up the host and say, ""I do."" I eat the host as I walk away. I say it's okay because I remember when Father Vance or someone else told us it's our choice as to whether we pick up a host and eat it or get a new one.",Negative

We are in the main church area and I ask a woman if the candy has been passed out yet to the congregation. She says yes. I ask, what about the taffy? She says yes to that also. Now I am a bit worried because that took up some time and I wonder if I'll have enough presentation for the time allotted. I hear the woman announcer say the name of this play is ""Women And Cancer."" I am surprised because the play is about pioneer women and raising their children. We begin the play. I open a large diaper bag that is very colorful and empty. I try to stand it up but it keeps falling over. I keep readjusting it. I do a monologue about pioneer women and children.

"I was down on the road I used to live on in Green City, at the bottom of the driveway where Cara used to live. Here there was a soft, marshy sort of area and in the middle of it, a tombstone. I forget what the exact words were on the thing but the gist was: some kid had run away from home and accidentally stepped into this marsh, which sucked him under and killed him. The tombstone had been placed there to warn all future runaways. I don't know how the tombstone stayed there. A whole bunch of other kids gathered and sat down around the tombstone and talked to me about it. Yeah, it's really sad, they agreed, but some kids really *need* to run away from home. Besides, there's not that many marshes out there.",Negative

In the park near the river, the outdoor movie was $9.50. They did have chairs. I saw Paula there. She was training 3 priests. I sat on the curb in front of the house, waiting for the mailman.

The tornado has a devastating effect, causing lots of damage: mass destruction. The people I'm with are safe. We are going to take a shower. Kari is in a wheelchair. I go into the shower, which is a very large open tile room with many shower stalls. I walk around the corner, out of Kari's view, and shower naked.

Hercules gets off his horse and picks up a small blue metal bow with a short white arrow. He is very casual about this, and does it slowly. This seems like it is in an area very similar to the pit-room at home. The arrow for the bow has a drawstring wrapped tightly around the notched end. He draws back the arrow with everyone standing around, and fires it into the throat of one of the guards, who also has a bow. As he does this, I feel his motions, as if I am he, shooting the arrow. The arrow was drawn slowly, with all the evil men around. The men didn't do anything about it. I run out of the front door of my home.

"There were goings-on at the Episcopal Church in Laurens. A cat was locked inside the church and she was afraid of people. She liked to sit on pianos and feel the vibrations. Don Ross and my art school sculpture teacher came in carrying a cat cage and a piano. But the cat had locked the doors behind itself. She wouldn't let them in. A crowd started forming outside the door, to minister to the cat, but she would NOT listen. She would hide under the piano or sit under a metal fold-up chair and look at the ceiling, which in her reality was the underside of the seat of the chair. There were 3 escaped convicts loose in the mall. They were trying to run a scam but one convict, who was suppose to be the lookout, just wanted to sit next to the radiator eating chicken legs. Back at the church, a crowd was forming around the door to see about the cat. They tried force and even the master key, but they couldn't get the door open. It turned out (that) Dora was in there comforting the cat and they were now friends. The church members began rioting because of their thwarted efforts toward good deeds. One guy and woman got in a fist fight in the corner and I tried to lure them out of the fight with snowballs, but I had no flavor juice. Just the snowball ice.

I said, ""OK,"" but I had no intentions of concerning myself with the town sewer. Not after how Mr. Patterson had carried on. My mother had built a strange musical instrument the whole width of the Bobo Chapel, but the strings were so loose they laid around on the instrument.

"We threw large rocks on a goose, then I grabbed it by the neck and my friend slit his throat and blood oozed out. The watchman came out, so I grabbed the goose and was taking it home.

"Slanted Wall Breakfast  I'm eating dinner in a room with a bunch of friends. We are dressed up. There is a slanted wall near the bed I am sitting on, which makes it difficult to sit up and eat at the same time. I'm eating eggs and bacon. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas comes in. She is wearing a dress with some fishnet stockings. My friend Anna Woods says it looks like Annie just shaved her legs.",Positive
"Mom wanted me to do some trick. There was a swamp thing out the back with an elephant in it. Its back was sticking out. I had to slide off it and go over this fence. I had a suspicion that it wasn't an elephant but a huge tiger or deer. After saying no over and over, I did it, but it wasn't an elephant -- it was a dinosaur. I was on its back and it stood up and was really tall and had a cone on its head. Ezra and I were stuck up high and Mom was down below trying to help us with a cardboard box. I told her to get rope and a better box. I thought that I head Eugene's voice and I could see over the fence, but it was that Salim guy.",Negative
"Kenneth is leaning out of a window and turned around looking up to the next floor and trying to kiss a man who is leaning down toward him. I watch, surprised, because Kenneth is married to a woman. Later, I am going on a vacation. I am catching a plane. I get on and realize I have not packed a thing. I had time to do so, but somehow I didn't manage to do it. I wear a black sheath dress. I have no meds, no other clothes, no books. I wonder how I'll manage. Now I'm on a boat-like thing and it's plowing through waters that look shallow, but must have a channel deep enough in it or we wouldn't be able to move. It's time to dress for dinner and a man wants to meet me, so I open a closet and see lots of formals and fancy dresses, nothing appropriate. I look through them, but don't find anything usable.",Negative
"I had just a short dream in which I was a Texan and had lots of money to give away. I want to give it away to support music or something like that. I didn't like any of the radio stations I heard around Texas. I was going to go elsewhere when I turned on one radio station and heard an opera. I didn't like that particular opera, but thought that was a sign of good cultural activity, so I decided to give lots of my money to Texas radio stations.",Negative
"Some people were after me and this guy. We ran into a shop. I had recently lost my shoes and I grabbed some more but I grabbed two left ones. I kept trying to look but the people kept turning up. We ran to the back of the store and into the toilet and locked the door. I sat at the door to hold it closed. They got in anyway. We attacked and got out. We found a fancy hotel place. There was a room with a spa bath etc. My friend died. I took his shoes which were big, but they fit. When I locked the door, I hit a button which sounded the alarm. They came and I left. Later, I came back. There was a pet shop and I got a uniform. They had a Chow Chow creature and the people were after that.",Negative

I grab up bunches of the ones with gold and rush back to the house to share my great discovery with the family. I lay the packages on the table as they are gathered there for a meal.

"I and some other women are in a room. I see water pouring into the room. I get very concerned. The room will fill up soon and we will drown. We look for an escape route. I see a window. We end up in another room, only the water is following us. I look out another window and see a huge drop off. It's a well or tower area, but I look way up and see daylight. There's an open area up there. It's our only chance -- to go with the flow of water out the window and dog paddle in it until it rises up high enough to reach that light. It's like walking into death and riding it up to life. We do so and successfully make it, only to find that area of the castle is filled with men who intend to rape us. What irony! [BL]",Negative
I and two men are in a large house. We've been up all night writing. Taking turns writing in a computer in a small room that looks out over the ocean. I am distracted from writing when I glance out the window and see how very blue the water is and I think I see a seal. But it is two black dogs sitting in a shrub tree. Then I see penguins and gulls all over. I realize it is the rocky surf and not yet the ocean I am looking at. The ocean is much further out. It is low tide. I then realize I'll never get my writing done if I spend all my time gazing at my ocean. The one man and I are a team helping each other as we write and co-writing the thing. There is a good mutual admiration society going on. [BL],Negative
"I am with a group of mothers. We all have elementary age school children. They are all participating in a play, all just bit parts. They each have a few minutes tops. I made a suggestion for improving something. We went to pick up our children. There were a lot of people around. We all arrived at about the same time. As we entered the building I headed to the left and everyone else kept going straight. Someone told me I was headed the wrong direction. They said I need keep going straight. There was as woman sitting at a table. We had to sign something to be able to pick up our children. The thing that she had for us to sign was a line-notepad that was approximately 3 x 5 inches. The pad was attached to a holder that was made of blue plastic and shaped somewhat like an isosceles triangle. She had all of our names listed on it and we just had to sign by our printed name.",Positive
"A rather complex dream of which only the following can be remembered -- scene appears to be in an army camp. My duty is to repeat, in a loud voice, the range-finding figures (elevation, windage, etc.) which are announced by another soldier. This soldier is also instructing me in ""taking down"" the breech of the gun. There is a pin to be pressed and this releases another pin and 2 screws which fall into a small, square tin box -- the gun breech apparently being partially enclosed by this box. When the screws drop out I am to see whether my fingers are small enough to go between the gun and side of box and reach down for the screws. Experimenting shows that I can pick up the screws between 3rd and 4th fingers (i.e., the 2 longest fingers) but can't turn my hand sufficiently to make use of my thumb. However, the soldier seems to feel that I will do as far as picking up the screws go.",Positive
"I remembered more of this dream than usual. It is a good example of how the scenes change. Usually all but one or two are forgotten. In this dream I came late for lunch to the cafeteria, bought steak, potatoes, peas, etc. Bill $1.05. I sat with some friends who left shortly. I was next in the chapel singing the words to a bib. Lit. theme which I held in my hand--not my own theme, the name was that of a man. Another girl played the piano. An organ student came in at 1:05 to practice. We (who?) went over to the recital hall where my singing teacher was auditioning on the violin with a quartet. Soon there was a whole orchestra and we found that we had missed the overture to Carmen. A group of singers were putting on a concert version. Saw the first act in English. Don Jose was a short blond boy who kept getting shorter, ending the scene with the words, ""I walk just like my mother.""",Positive

"In this dream I was on the street in front of the house where I used to live. A neighbor, Benny, who I haven't seen in 5 or 6 years, was there too. He was flying a kite. Benny is now about 27, but in the dream he was younger, around 20. I recall that he was having trouble with the kite. He couldn't keep it in the air, and it almost got twisted up in the telephone wires. As the kite came down toward the ground, I remember seeing that it had no tail on it, and I surmised that this was the reason why it wouldn't fly too well. I remember that the kite was a dark blue color and torn in some places. The last I recall was Benny running down the street, trying to get the kite up in the air again.",Negative
"My boyfriend Jeremy and I were going for a walk.  I wanted to show him the park my maternal Grandpa Gerald had taken my brother Stuart and I to once long ago, but I had no idea how to get there.  We walked for a while and talked, with a solemn feeling.  He stopped to look at something, and I decided to continue on, driving my mother's car.  I found the park.  Everything felt odd like the park had some strange significance somehow.  Next to the play equipment was an old building.  In front was a setup of a large hamster cage with lots of hamsters.  I walked around it and stood, watching the hamsters.  Then my high school classmates Mack and Ryan showed up.  We caught up a little.  I told them about my four jobs.  They were still in college.  Then I had to go find Jeremy since he hadn't watched where I went and I figured he would be looking for me.  The mood was kind of sad or mourning.",Negative

"I had a computer document that Bev and BJ both wanted a copy of. When I told them it was created in Publisher Bev said that she no longer had Publisher software on her computer and she made some kind of comment about what a pain that is and that it had something to do with hospital budget I think. BJ said she had Publisher. I asked her what version it was and it was a very old version like 1990. I don't even think there was a 1990 version of Publisher, or even of Windows. But that's what she said. I said, Oh. Well then you won't be able to open it because an old version of Publisher can't open a document that was created in a newer version unless both versions are 2002 or newer. Then John S was going to do some work on my computer. I had a new hard drive to install and something else but I don't what it was. It was something that I have never installed before. So he was working on my computer and he was working on some other stuff too. He got ready to quit and he hadn't installed this one thing that was most important yet. He said something about not getting it done so I started asking him if it was something I could install myself or asking him how to install it myself. Then I think Bev said something to him so he decided to go ahead and take the time to install it himself. I felt kind of bad about it but it turned out that it only took a few minutes to do.",Positive

I turn and walk into the kitchen and I look for a drawing of Ellie holding Charla (a profile like my lake Michigan picture of holding Ellie). My mother had drawn the picture. It's very sweet and cute. She accidentally drew another picture on the same paper right under it. I wanted to make a Xerox copy of it. I see two half smashed like butts on the sink of dirty dishwater and I reach to put them out, because they are my mother's and this is a silly, childish revenge. She sees me and says, ""Oh, no you don't."" I try to snub them out, but she hits me on the butt. I cry, ""Oow! Don't."" And I try to hit her back. I scratch at her chest and try to hit her arm. Finally I grab the front and side of her dress and start swinging her back and forth to smash her up against the counters that are at a 90 degree angle. I smash her to the left and back to the right.

They stayed for a short time, and during that time I was trying to find a baseball game on the radio, but I couldn't.

Onesies, twosies, threesies, but with the basketball, not a small ???. First I practiced and did it good. Then I couldn't get past onesies. I felt pitiful but there was nothing I could do. Some people could bounce it all the way to ninesies (sevens). Then I tried to print from the negatives.

I prefer being on the dry sand; it seems safer than the rock or the water. So I say, ""Let's go."" We go out to find things. I find two ink pens. I notice the tide is coming back in and warn Ellie. I see three books in a hole in the sand. I try to pick them up but the tide comes in and I get knocked down and all wet. I say, ""Oh, no. I got wet and cold for nothing!"" I go toward shore.

"Matthew had gotten some mice as pets. They were brownish-grey in color. I was helping him with them. There were several wire cages that had things that were tube-shaped and no bigger in diameter than the mice themselves.

I was sitting on the floor and frequently picking a mouse up from one area of the carpet and placing it near a cage. I said something to Matthew about how odd it was that I was willing to sit there with these mice and that I was even willing to handle them.

"I was with two other people. We had these things about the size of a credit card. They were in two pieces. We would put them together with our arms stretched up in the air, and it would lift us up into the air and through an opening in the ceiling. We had to be standing in just the right place. We had to find the right spot on the ceiling. The ceiling in this place was a wood ceiling. I don't know if we were looking for something. Someone said something about us going there to get our share. After it lifted us through we would keep entering these different rooms. In each room we had to find the thing that would let us through into the next place. When I say through I mean we would put these two things together with our arms stretched above us and it would pull us through this place in the wall. Some of them were decorated with Christmas stuff. I always had a more difficult time getting through those. I finally said to someone, about the third time, it was a Christmas thing, and I had trouble getting through. It was almost as though I was trying to break through a clear, rubbery substance. It looked like a regular Christmas display but when I tried to go through it would be very rubbery and difficult to break through. After the third time I said, All three times it was Christmas that I had difficulty getting through. I guess that tells me I still haven't worked through my Christmas issues. I've had a dream like this before, where I was going through these different rooms and breaking through these different scenes in a similar fashion. It seemed that to start this whole journey, or travel, or whatever, we had to take a bunch of pills that were various colors, sizes, and shapes. We were in this drug store or something and I worked there but then someone else that I worked for at another place came in and I couldn't let him see that I worked there. It would have made him mad. So I ducked behind the pharmacy counter and was trying to hide. But the owner that I worked for here was a pharmacist and was working back there. I finally had to say, I'll explain in a minute. As I was ducking down. I ducked down kind of in front of her and was trying to hide because this other person, I think it was a man came looking behind the counter. As he did so the pharmacist opened her pharmacy jacket enough to hide me further from his view so he didn't see me. After he left I said, I'm sorry. I work there too but he can't know that I also work here because it would make him mad. So she handed me a prescription and said, well, here. Just take care of this. I didn't want her to know that I was getting ready to leave to do this other thing - whatever it was. So I took the prescription and walked away.",Negative

"I was sitting in the driver's seat of our old minivan in a parking lot waiting to drive across the street to the post office, to mail my parents cell phone back to them. Right then, the cell phone rang. I debated answering it, because I never use it (I had merely borrowed it for a cross-country road trip). I picked it up, and it was my mom complaining and reminding me to return the cell phone. I told her I was going to do that right now and by her calling, it was only going to take longer.",Positive
"I can't decide if what I was doing was for school or for pleasure. I was in an historic home. I was there with other people that I knew. Supposedly the house was haunted by a former female owner of the house. During the visit we all went into one room for a kind of class. We had to go which makes me think it was for school. There was something about women had died in this room before when some certain thing occurs. I was sitting in the room listening to the lecture. The woman giving the lecture was dressed in period clothing but I can't tell you what period it was. She was talking to us as though she was this woman who continues to haunt the home. I was sitting there thinking that every time I am in that room I get a really sore throat. I thought it was related to this ghost but I don't know why. As the lecture continued she was talking about her ability to create bubbles or something out of this tube of liquid. We all had clear glass tubes with blue liquid in them. The tube was actually six-sided. I was holding mine between my legs but I don't know why. I think it had something to do with my not wanting to influence it with my hands. As the lecturer was talking I was watching the liquid in my tube and I realized that I was the one that was. It was like she was trying to blow a bubble out of this liquid. That the liquid would rise to the edge of the tube and then form a bubble on the top outside of the tube. While she was trying to do whatever it was I was watching the liquid in my tube rise and still hoping that I wasn't the one she had chosen because that meant that I was the one that was going to die if this legend continued of women dying in this home at the hands of this ghost. As the liquid rose it started seeping out of the tube onto something on my leg that was round but it had grooves in it almost like flower petals or a starfish, kind of like spokes coming out from the center of the circle. The blue liquid would ooze out and was filling these indentations in this round circular thing. Then it didn't ooze out from there. Somehow the liquid stayed contained in the grooves of this circle even though there were no edges on it to prevent the liquid from seeping out. The woman who was presenting the lecture and posing as the ghost approached me. We were talking about this circle thing on my leg. She was touching it and was trying to assure me that I was not going to be the next one to die as a result of this. After the lecture was over we were in another part of the house and we were still discussing it. Again I noticed a sore throat. There were other people that we were talking to in the house.",Negative

"I dreamed that my mother had died and my entire family was gathered in our living room after the funeral. We were all upset and everyone was very unhappy, and some of the family were crying. I was very unhappy, but was not crying , and I was talking to no one. I looked across the room and saw one of my sisters crying and very upset. I walked over to her and in front of everyone announced to her that I could see no reason why she was crying and acting as though she was upset. I told her that she of all people should never cry at my mother's death since she had done nothing while my mother was alive to make her anything but miserable and unhappy. At that point I was in the center of comments from the entire family, and I began to cry. My roommate then awakened me because I was sobbing in my sleep.

"I was as if reading -- seeing -- being a novel by Jane Austen (so it was in the dream, although this isn't really a Jane Austen type) of a little girl in Puritan times in New England, sort of masochistically un-fun-loving and full of religious fervor, who liked to endure hardships unnecessarily. I was not enjoying the novel, but kept up with it because it was supposed to be a classic and therefore had to be good. This ""novel"" merged into another story based on Moby Dick. A small boy by a lake was fishing, and from the dark water some enormous thing rose up and ate all of his line. He ran away. The dark thing in the water was a whale which was going to devour everything, or at least was very threatening. Some man was going to go out in a boat and fight it, I think.",Positive

"I was in the lobby of a hotel, at the desk or the bar, watching a ball game on TV.  A very attractive black girl came in with another girl, white, and stood very close to me.  She was in physical contact with me somehow, either affectionately or accidentally.  Soon, though, they left and headed for the elevator.  Suddenly I had the feeling I had been taken, and I grabbed for my billfold.  It was there, but I was already starting after them and shouting to the hotel clerk that I had been robbed as I looked inside.  Sure enough, I found only $2, where before I had had about $50.  They had already gone up on an elevator.  I started to go up another one, but decided it would be best for me to wait until they came down or send someone up to search for them while I waited.  After a while I looked up and saw them calmly sitting in a mezzanine coffee shop over the lobby.  I ran up there and they jumped up and ran for the stairs.  The other girl was my sister Nancy.  I caught one or the other of them and threatened to bash her head in with a glass ashtray I had picked up.  I don't remember whether that was before or after I had chased her downstairs, or what happened to the other one.  In the chase I would go halfway down a flight of stairs, then vault the banisters onto the next flight.  The girl I was chasing did the same thing, though, and I gradually lost ground on her.  I was shocked and upset that Nancy was involved, and I couldn't get her to tell me why.  Later, I was walking with Mother to my car on a darkened street, and we were talking about it, and she didn't know what to make of it either.  Later, also in Nancy's presence (I think), and outdoors, Jim Duggan appeared, and he either attacked me or I felt threatened by him, and I had to defend myself.  I quickly got the upper hand and had him draped backwards over the back of a park bench.  Maybe Jody was there too.  Sharon Ferguson was somehow involved too, and I went to her house to question her.  Apparently the first time she was busy or going out or something, because I came back a second time, hoping to see her mother, whom I hadn't seen in a long time.  Their neighborhood was pretty much the one where Nancy was born.",Negative

And let's see, what happened first? Samantha, Sandra, and Derek and Teresa and Paula and Patricia, and they all went off to do something, and they were splashing and ______ing in the springs and stuff, and shooting down the river, and Mom and Dad and I were sitting at an area that really closely resembled Circle Lake Park.

There were little fish symbols, and I didn't know what to make of them. And then some were normal and some were stupid things like 1 X 12 and 0 X 4 and stupid stuff like that. And also there was one really challenging one though that was 23 X 63. And I was thinking, ""Okay, how do I do this one? I don't the space to write it out, and I don't have a calculator. So, okay, I can do 9 X 23 and then do 7 X 23 and add those two numbers together and that would be the answer to what 63 X 23 is."" And then I woke up.",Positive

"Choosing Restaurants  I'm with a group of people who go to Brimson in Oak Valley. We're going out to eat. We go by my friend Gino Teavor's house and come to the intersection of Holy Avenue and Main Street. A man in our group is driving a black Suburban. My friend Tom Napper owns the Suburban, and is with the man in it. The man scratches the side of the Suburban while pulling up to the light, and then backing up next to some cement posts. Tom is angry that this happened. I'm worried that the man won't cross Main Street without being hit by a car. There is a lot of cross-traffic. I don't trust him, and I wish I were driving. I'm on a bicycle next to the Suburban. I balance on the bicycle, not moving, but not touching my feet to the ground. My friend Norman Noman and ex-girlfriend Jackie Hunter are there. They talk about the name of a cell. We all cross the street. I'm the only person on a bicycle. My bicycle is an old 10-speed. There are two restaurants to choose from: The Greasepit, or ____, which has a name similar to the Copper Lantern, but is a fast food place by the locksmith on Main Street. I ask people where they want to go. My classmate Fred Potter says the Copper Lantern-like place. We all turn right and go to this place. They serve turkey sandwiches. I go up to order. I see an order being served: it is turkey on two pieces of white bread with mayonnaise and some little trimmings. I ask the man serving it if that's all they have. He says it comes cut in half. I see on the price board that the cost of the sandwich is $4.76. I think to myself that I'm hungry, and would want three or four sandwiches. This is too expensive for me. I get on the bicycle and go to the Greasepit. People yell for me as I go. I go through the trailer park, breaking open a gate as I ride. I ride through a forest.

I don't want him to try to persuade me to go back. I just want to just be, and in this case to be without him. The tune he sings is a kind of uplifting, mid 1980's, cheesy, see-the-light song.

I went to the house and I wanted to look at the damage, but got distracted and went inside.  I was holding two red birds- some type of small parrot perhaps.  One started pecking at its feet, and the foot popped right off.  I was disgusted and saddened by this, and looked away.  I had been eating something, but couldn't continue.

It was another A&P; right beside the one that's already out there. It was a little bit smaller. It seemed rather strange to me that they would have a second A&P; there, but I decided to get in it just to see what it's like. I thought probably a lot of other people would too since it was an A&P;, and people who shop at one would probably shop at another. So I went in it and although I don't think I've ever been in the store in real life, it seems like I must have been in it in another dream because the layout of the store was familiar to me and it was rather not like you usually find in a grocery store. The spices and flour were in one place. But at any rate, I looked thru this grocery store and contrary to any of my expectations, there were very few people in it. It was a small store and I thought maybe they needed some business, but I was going to have to go to the other store because they didn't have everything I wanted. When I got to the meat counter, I was astonished, there were very little meat cuts that I recognized. There was a lot of fish. I ended up getting some round steak and flounder. While I only got these 2 things, I got 3 packages. Somehow that seemed quite right to me at the time. Then I went to the checkout counter in this little store and checkout corner, where it should have been, was sort of a cafeteria. There were several tables and booths around for people who come shopping to have their lunch. Then a boy came up and took my cart and took it back into this office and closed the door behind him to add up my food, then present me with the bill and then bring it to the car. It was a rather unusual procedure, but I went into another room and sat down and there were quite a few people sitting around there. The boy with the groceries was gone. I think I finally got up and went out thinking he would follow me eventually, and started looking for our car and also my husband. It seems I finally found them both and we were sitting in the car waiting for the groceries to be brought.",Negative
"My former room-mate had an apartment and her colored maid was working for her.

"I was outside a shop. There was a grassy area, but I don't remember a carpark. There was a lady a bit in front of me. There was also a tank or something.

It had something to do with Jude Law who was suspected of being involved with this Italian pizza place. This cop went and was asking them questions. I snuck in and heard Jude Law talking to this guy about 'getting it taking care of'. It was then a TV show and the cop was Tony Hale and his character's name was Hale or something. My character was called Izzy, but I was trying to think of a cool last name. For some reason I wanted it starting with a 'T', though I thought of Pritchard, and thought 'no, because it's obviously from Eugene' and Winter.

"I'm in my parent's RV. I'm on vacation someplace, again, and I see we're at a college, but this college is unique -- it's set up like a theme park. Each department has its own 'land' to decorate. Thus, here is Physicsland, here is Archaeologyland, etc. I stumble into the department for the study of subcultures -- everything is grungy and citylike. There's graffiti pieces everywhere, covering everything. Hookers are standing around. A street sign that says ""TWO"" is on the corner -- this was supposed to mean like Second Street, Downtown, etc. Somehow, I stumble into the Porn department. It seems that some religious vandal has been through, ripping the place apart, throwing videotapes and movie reels, film, photos, everywhere. Some bureaucratic vandals have been through, too -- the Porn department is being cut, immediately. The head of the department, a clean-cut, sixtyish, solid woman in a business suit, explains what's happening. As I stand there listening, two or three young women come in, wearing very casual, California surfer-type clothes. When they hear the news they become very, very upset -- one is even crying. they put a lot into their department, after all. Quite apart from the lascivious thought that I would *love* to see the films these ladies made, I feel very sorry for them. They're obviously seeing a lot of their work going down the tubes right now. I talk to one or two of them and make friends; I team up with a graffiti writer, too. We go back to my parents RV but they won't have anything to do with me; I've befriended scum and sluts. Well then, I think, fuck you too. We 'escape', taking the train tracks. Halfway along a strange plant is laying in the tracks, half green, half red. I immediately recognize it for a ludicrously huge celery plant. The red is the roots. I examine it carefully with a special examining hat the graffiti writer gives me. A huge freight train comes by and obliterates the celery. By way of contrast, I suppose, a BART train comes by and is nearly knocked off the tracks by a clod of dirt. Now somehow in here we end up carrying all these huge vegetables. Well, we're going to make our final escape through this person's house, but *somebody* slams a door, and by the time we get outside, it's TOO LATE!!! Guards are everywhere, and we're trapped. Just then a huge Native American man comes by and strikes a deal. They'll let us go if we divide up our huge veggies. We lay them on a table. We have nine. We would have had ten, but the celery was destroyed.",Negative
"This is kind of humorous, a lovely couple that I know, Bill and Barbara, Barb is just the sweetest lady, good sense of humor, love to be around her, so the incongruity of this is kind of funny: I was sitting in a chair holding a baby girl, and I guessed that she was about 8 months old. I was talking to the baby and I referred to her as ""Little Party Girl"" and I am sure I meant it as a word of endearment, Barbara's reaction was just completely baffling to me.

"Different people are asked to write down whether they thought I and this man were to become lovers or best friends or what. These people are couples. I am reading their responses. They've written them at various stations or places in a room. One couple describes how we learn from each other and grow and do things better because we're together.

He's got a blue-colored syringe thing with poison in it and he's trying to stab it in my neck. I fight hard, and as I finally succeed in shoving the ladder far enough for it to fall away, he lunges to rescue it, miscalculates and tumbles over the edge, screaming as he falls to his death.

"(02/25/97)[""Japanese Exchange students.""] Two Japanese exchange students are with me for a weekend. We are in a house and discussing what activities we could do.

One package he eats very strangely. He buries his mouth in a lump of the food and gulps it down, making lots of noise. I find that curious.

A lady saw me using my phone when I was texting Darius and she sent me to the office. At 2.55pm, Ezra got sent there too. I messaged Mom to get her to put $500 towards my car.

I've been in the house with my friend, and now I'm just going out past the pool, but lo and behold, down at this end you have to walk into the water on wood steps and things. Crossing to a kind of raft-thing, I then find there's no more steps all the way through this barn-like structure to the outside. I'm at a loss for a while - I'm in shorts, etc., not dressed for swimming, and not keen on it anyway. But I guess I have to, so I get down into it and find I can tread okay, I don't sink in all the way. I go on out and then realize I've left my purse and notebook on the raft. Damn. I have to go back for them, no help for it, so I do. There are a lot more people on it now, and I'm worried for a minute that my purse may not be there, but it is, almost under some others and between a couple of women sitting on each side. I get my things and [go out again? no continuity.]",Negative

"Somewhere, in a place like the Administrative Wing, there's an office like Mr Slaughter's or Jan's - beyond it is an open space. All the walls and panels are a medium dark peach. The lighting is indirect and down some. Seems like night. I'm looking into this ""office"" - which is bigger than usual - and there's a large incubator-type thing in it. I can see it has something alive and furry in it so I go look. There are actually 3 human babies in it, all asleep, and 3 huge guinea pigs, and some large hamsters. Somebody has told me to go look at the hamsters, but didn't mention the babies. I consider that odd. It seems to be some kind of experiment.I'm in a house with a young girl. I'm visiting, I don't know anybody here very well. Seems like she has a younger sister. We are going somewhere, and next door stop at a little house with bushes out front that have candy bars on them. She's looking over one and I see she's got a Violet Crumble in her hand. I'm delighted and start looking for one of my own. I'm listening to a girl whine at me, everything's wrong with her and her life, etc. As she turns to me, I see a crystal. I guess she'd been wearing it but I see it separately. It's clear but has green inside it and another color outside - maybe part of the setting, another stone. It has a silver cap on it.",Negative

We went to buy programs, and the whole place was lit up with a red light.  We started to go back to our seats, but I went up the wrong set of stairs.  At the top of the stairs, it was pitch black dark, so I ran back down and went back to our seats.  The show started and a thin lady with blonde hair came down in a trapeze.

"Three Tornadoes At Brimson  I'm with two women. We are seeking cover because tornadoes are coming towards us. We find a large sturdy church-like building at Brimson College and go into the bottom floor. It is safer than other nearby buildings with people in. The tornadoes go through. Afterwards, we are all okay. We look around. Paramedics are there. Some people are hurt. I go into a building where my friend Stephen was supposed to be. We would be on the bottom floor. The top floor, where I am, has a floor made of a web-like net. I carefully crawl across it. I call out for Stephen. He got out, and is okay. I go down a floor, where people are waiting to get out. I'm going to break a window. A girl says, ""No!"", not to break the window. A broken window will cost $60. I say to her, ""Isn't getting all these people out worth more than $60?"" Then we see the window slides open. I open it. The girl then sees the whole window slides open, so there is a larger opening. We can get out. I see a replay of what happened.

Then I was at home and I think I had a test or something the next day. I was anxious about something. Drake came into my room and we were fooling around a bit. Then he left for a moment (to get water, maybe?) and I had the most intense orgasm I've ever had in real life or in dreams. It was so powerful and still going when Drake came back. I insisted that we have sex that instant, but then my parents walked in and it was horrible! Drake was mortified, and I was furious. I think my parents just tried to ignore what was happening. Drake was so embarrassed that we would have to have dinner with them later.",Negative

There are old cranes that have been welded together to form some kind of sculpture or a kind of bridge or span.  It's not very elegant, but it looks like it took a lot of effort to do. One person (a female art student) did this apparently with some technical help over 3 years - some kind of art project. She explains it's not finished, but that she's been working on it gradually. Part of me is impressed with the sheer ambition and effort. But part of me is also unimpressed - conceptually and aesthetically it's rather meaningless and slapdash.

I show her the paintings, yellow in one room and blue in another, designs on the wall, sort of sketched in some places and fully done in other places. I am mildly curious why she chose to do this. It is ironic since she and I haven't spoken since the Mexico trip. Maybe it's a peace offering. Now I have a white dresser with a mirror on it and some pictures I want to take to the sidewalk ""Saturday market"" kind of thing to sell, only Rosemary has painted part of it blue; thick blue paint. I realize this will make it come down in value. Ironic, eh? Rosemary was trying to help. I decide it was never painted in the first place.

Then I took Bob and flew up high and I came down and up in a dive-bomber style like I flew fast. I touched a young girl's sex organs and it was a male instead of a girl. It got hard for him. Then he touched my sex organs and it was so sensitive that I had to push his hand away and he always came close to me and did it to me. I saw large black walnuts on the ground. A big truck was coming down the road, which was narrow. The big wheel and tires sunk into the mud and the mud pushed towards me. I moved to the edge of the road. We were sitting on a boat and funny bugs and salamander like things moved by. The boat was on land. A big savage of some kind came by and pushed our boat into the water and started to row us out. His enemies came along the shore and they were throwing objects at us. I held onto Bob. I was afraid we would overturn and Bob would drown because he couldn't swim. I was half asleep and I heard loudly Beachhead. I was looking for a farm. I went to Rivertown. I met Mike Farina. I was going up a hill to get one at a small store. One of my friends was to be a rebel so I got a pail of dirty water and said, ""So you want to be a rebel,"" and I gave him water as he came at me. He finally gave up, then Kogler said he was going to be a rebel. I threw some water under a door where Kogler was putting on the rebel clothes.",Negative
"I was walking through a ""Museum of Human Anatomy"" with a number of other people. We come soon to the skull display. There is one skull in full light, and another one beside it, indirectly lit, so it is mainly in the darkness. This skull has skin stretched over it, dead, straw-like hair, and eyeballs. The lips seem to be cut off. It doesn't look like he died a very pleasant death. Most of this is pretty well hidden by the obscure lighting, however. So we're walking along, and this idiot hippie guy bumps into the case, knocking the hideous head out into the full light. Everybody is very disgusted and turns away. The hippie guy says: ""Whoa... sick."" It wakes me up.",Negative
"I've just come home - we live in this shabby house on a big street, on the corner and there's nothing on the right side of it (as you're facing the house) but a busy street, some empty lots, and maybe a shopping center or a main drag. I've never actually stayed here - we've moved in just recently and I've been away for some reason. They've given me this front room that has a big window on the side and a smaller one on the front, and the only curtains are tired-looking white sheers. The overhead light's very bright, and I find when I start to change clothes that I can't do it practically anywhere in the room - with the sheers you can see the whole room, and there's plenty of traffic outside - I'm really self-conscious. I've already pulled off my top and I'm holding it against me, and don't know what else to do. I really resent this - those slobs of parents of mine shouldn't have done this to me, they just don't care. (My parents are Bonnie and a slovenly, hairy guy in an undershirt.) I try to think of something I can do but can't think of anything. There are cats here, Tree in particular but also others I don't know well and haven't been here long. One's just died suddenly, it was quite a surprise. Now another one is playing around, sort of jumping up on its hind legs in front of Tree, and gets hit in the head by the ceiling fan. Poor thing - I'm sorry, but I'm really bamboozled now. This is too weird. Later, as I'm looking for something to put over the windows (I think) I'm poking outside and start to take a box, but I look in it first, quickly realizing that's the box we put the dead cat in; I just glance in briefly and move away.",Negative
"I dreamed I was at the beach, but it wasn't a beach I knew. It was a strange beach because suddenly the sea came both in front and behind the sand on which I stood. However, it didn't look threatening. Little by little I found myself on an island. I was with other people, both familiar and unfamiliar, but I don't remember who the known ones were. I awoke, but I was not frightened at the advancing sea. It was strange. The dream seemed to have a feeling of danger, but I wasn't scared.",Negative
"My husband and I were in some very large building, something like a hotel, only I don't think it was, and we were spending the night there. In the middle of the night, for some reason, I woke up and heard this funny noise, and I was listening to it, trying to figure out what it was. And all of a sudden my husband said it wasn't something, a clock or something, which apparently he was thinking I thought it was. It was somebody counting out his reels of tape in an adjoining room, and he could hear them counting them out or something. We did hear this clicking noise. It did sound like it might be plastic tape reels. These tapes contained the data from some experiment or another that he had done and were extremely valuable and apparently this person was going to try to steal them. So my husband got up and I don't remember whether he took a pistol or not, but he went into the next room and started talking to this person. I could just hear their voices, but not exactly what they were saying. I wondered if I should go thru the other rooms and call for help. I was debating this and then my husband came back into the room with the man he had found there who was in his late 30's, say, and sort of a big man, sort of foreign-looking, although he didn't speak with any particular accent. He had a little mustache, and I don't remember exactly how it happened, but some woman came into the room and my husband had persuaded all of these people that it was about time for breakfast, and it was about 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning by this time. He wasn't trying to arrest the person who was trying to steal the tapes or anything like that. He thought it would be a good idea if we all sat down and had some breakfast, so I was trying to fix some and there wasn't anything in the refrigerator that would do for breakfast. There were a few slices of Canadian bacon, and there was a big steak that I was cooking. My husband had told me that the reason for this breakfast was to have another witness, and this being this woman, that this man had actually been here, but it was a little bit vague.",Positive
"I am at a table. I pour sugar-frosted shredded wheat things into a bowl. I pick up a cup with a drop or two of tea in it. Dwight says, ""I'll get you some more tea."" I say, ""Thanks."" Paulina is on my right. He gives me back the cup and I see that there is barely enough tea to cover the bottom of the cup. I feel robbed and say, ""There isn't very much to eat here."" My mother says, ""Don't be silly. Let me see."" I hand her the cup, which is now a huge glass bowl. As I hand it to her I feel a little embarrassed because I realize it is the size of the bowl that makes it seem I haven't enough tea. I drink the tea and realize I've picked up the wrong container and I had started to sip from a bag of coffee beans. I spit it out and wonder if all this sugar and coffee will hurt me. I then drink my herbal tea.",Negative
"The first part of the dream I was with a bunch of friends and we felt like doing something stupid and rebellious, but we figured we'd better have my other friend Sally along. Since nobody else knew the way to her house, I drove. Eventually we just sat around talking, eating cookies, and making scrap-books in the middle of the night, up in Sally's loft. I had some mini-dream about being in a computer game. Me and my family and family friends went to this Club Med, and they were all a part of the Club Med circus team, and they wanted me to do the trapeze. I'm an acrophobic, so they couldn't get me to do it. Right at the end of my dreams, Whitney Houston sang ""I will always love you."" Setting: In a car along some fairly busy road; Sally's house/loft; in some sort of computer game; at a Club Med with a 50-foot flying trapeze. Characters: A bunch of friends, though I distinctly remember Jon, Sally and Brian; nobody in the computer dream; my brother and mom I don't quite remember, but my dad and his friend Joel, and his two daughters were definitely there, and the trapeze guy, and Whitney Houston. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, terrified. I know the trapeze thing must have come from when I asked my dad last night what ""fear of heights"" was and he said acrophobia. I think my brother was playing computer games like that. And I was listening to the radio last night so Whitney Houston probably came from there.",Positive
"Red Sweater Men Singing  I'm with my mom. We walk into an academic building. There is a man and a boy wearing red sweaters practicing music on a piano and singing. We keep walking. There is a folk group practicing with all different instruments.  I am with my brother Wally, sister Ramona, and classmate Holly Tanks. My mom is picking us up. We're at the Middle Mall. Nellie Hammer, from my economics class, walks by.  I go into a building. There are fish on the wall. They are either mounted or drawn. These show fish size for different species; maybe the record size. It shows the biggest muskie was caught in Connecticut. I'm in the basement of this building. Reggie and Joel, two guys I catch chickens with, are there. There is a skunk in the basement. We run up the stairs to get away from it. We're about to catch a barn of chickens. I'm with my friend Tiny, who is also a chicken catcher. I don't have my chicken-catching shoes, and neither does Tiny. He catches without socks on his arms, and with some funky wrestling-like shoes. I catch in my Sketcher shoes. All the socks I have are hand socks with holes cut in them. I wear two or three pairs. Then I find my bag of chicken-catching clothes. I go into the barn. There are cows in an adjacent barn. The pallets to put the chickens in are in an odd fashion: several short rows with an end cap-like pallet, too. It confuses me. The catchers are annoyed with me for not working hard. I try to get away slacking off: not working hard.",Negative

James says something about ambivalent problems. - I am painting a picture on the wall of the Church: with water colors, like El Greco.

When we took a break to do this I didn't stand up to connect with someone right away so I had to sit and wait for someone to be free. As soon as I saw one woman sit down - finished - I asked her if she would take the photographs of me. We moved around to different places in the room. There was one place that had grey curtains. It was almost like a stage area. I was going to sit on the edge of the stage and have the grey curtains in the background. She didn't like the grey background. There was another place where the walls were kind of a cream/beige color. She thought that would be a better background. We went over to that area. As she was getting ready to start I realized that everyone else was done and sitting down. I said, This isn't good. Everyone is sitting there watching now.",Negative
"I was in front of the house.  There was a tall man wearing a velvet cloak.  Touching him made one man who looked somewhat slovenly into a green suit, so he looked like a superhero.  Something about this strange man or his cloak was somehow magical and touching him improved things.  My brother Stuart got to touch him as something went on.  I really wanted to touch him as well, but I was self-conscious about coming off rude, fulfilling my own needs without respect for the man.  He was in the process of something and I got to barely brush my hand against the velvet cloak while his back was turned.  The feeling was amazing; reenergizing and blissful.  Then there were three cats in a pool.  Somehow the cloaked man had touched the pool, and apparently the magical effect had transferred to the pool.  The cats were addicted to the sensation and wouldn't get out of the pool.  I reached in and pulled one out before it drowned.  The tall, cloaked figure spoke to me; he asked me if I had gotten to touch him yet, offering.  I said no not really, so I could touch him again and feel the wonderful sensation, even though I knew that it wouldn't have the same transforming effect the first touch had.",Negative

I get out and go around back for some reason - there are people around, some going along a pathway that gets you to the grounds, others hanging around socializing. I'm not terribly anxious to be noticed, whatever it is that I'm doing (I'm looking for something, or a way to do something, but I have to poke around to do that), so I give it a miss and go back to the car. I'm thinking it might be more practical and fun to go from this point on a bicycle, though I'm not sure how practical it is. I get the bike out of the car and try it out. It's really very nice, a very nice day for riding and a nice bit of path. But I think to myself, how am I going to bring the car along too? Actually I think I can do it easily enough, it'll just be awkward and slow me down and I'm rather in a hurry. But I can't leave it behind.",Negative
"A man is being chased by another man who means to kill him - I can see it all as if it's a movie. The killer isn't mad to kill him, just determined, as if he's a hit man. The other guy is nice looking, I believe I know him, and he's clever and has been able to outwit the other guy [the killer] up to now. He's still looking for a way to duck out of sight. They are walking, outside in a downtown area, where there's crowds of people, so the bad guy can't just run after the other and shoot him down. But he's getting closer. At one point the good guy struts across an intersection to fit in with other people, and the bad guy does the same. Finally the bad guy really does catch up, and turns the other to face him. The good guy seems a little bit nervous, but you can see he's trying to look at ease and amused. Typical adventure hero. He takes the gun the bad guy's holding, not out of his hand, but with his hand and moves his whole arm around some way that resembles locking arms to drink champagne romantically. Ends up with the gun pointed at his own cheek. So it appears he's going to do the job for the hit man, in a way, but he's got a little smile on his face and I realize that what'll happen when he pulls the trigger is the gun will pull the hand around and the hit man will be shot instead. (Dream ends before that happens but my reaction is a bit of tension whether that'll work or not.)",Negative

"Connie Hutchinson was in this dream, but I remember few of the details.  The relationship between us was one of warmth, with possibly some anxiety mixed in from some source.  I don't remember any physical contact between us, and most of the time I think there were other people around.  At one point, at someone's house, she sat on top of a cabinet or refrigerator, with her legs apart.  She was wearing a dress, and I kept stealing glances at her, afraid someone else would notice.

"I dreamed about our next door neighbors and the wife's parents and sister who had come down to see them, which in fact happened yesterday. And I dreamed that these people belonged to some funny religious sect, some sort of fundamentalist thing which I've been told they do. But at any rate, I went over to see them and it was in the evening, and everybody was sitting around and we were all going to sing hymns. They were going to be led by the girl's father and there was no music or anything, and I didn't know any of these hymns, but you had to sing them just right. I was sort of upset by this because I didn't feel like I could do it. But we sang a few anyway and I think I noticed at this time that they had a big aquarium sitting over in one part of the house with some tropical fish in it which didn't seem to be getting along too well, and I presume that her parents had brought these with them from their home. It seems like it was the next morning and my neighbor came over to tell me that all of her fish were dying. What they were going to do with them, they had a little flower garden out in their front yard and rain water stood in it and they were going to put these fish in it, and I didn't think that was a very good idea because if they were dying in the aquarium, it seem like this would be even worse for them, but she was sort of insistent and that they were going to do it. I looked at the place that she meant, and it was, at fist it just looked like some muddy puddles among some flowers, and then it became a little pond, a little fish pond with several types of fish swimming around init and with this funny-looking creature which I called a glass snake, but I don't think it was such a thing. As a matter of fact, I don't think there's any such thing around. It looked somewhat like a larval eel in that it was completely transparent, and you could see just right through it, and you could see all of its internal organs because they were of a different color, but it was a strange little animal. Well, it looked like it was only a foot or so long, and it looked like it couldn't hurt anybody, still it acted so vicious that we were sort of afraid of it. And I told my husband about it. That we couldn't go over there because there was a glass snake in their yard, and he didn't seem very impressed and he wanted me to draw him a picture of it and so I drew him one.",Negative
"I was working in a group to compete in some sort of dessert-making contest.  We talked about what we wanted and I went to go home to get something from my mother's cake-decorating supplies- perhaps sprinkles.  To do so I was going to take the shortcut through the Winchester Mystery House.  I went in the back door and had no idea which way to go, but somehow made it through the dim halls pretty quickly.  When I got back, there were 12 girls who were supposed to be attracting the guys and end up coupled.  I had no idea how to go about getting the guys' attention, so I started to talk to the small girl instead.  She was laying on her side.  She was only about 18 inches long, like a doll.  One of the guys came to talk to her.  One of the guys' approaches to wooing the girls was to read a poem.  I listened.  It was very sweet.

I was waiting for Susie's mother, who was going to bring us some shoes, rather old ones, that she was asking somebody to give to us, so that we could take them on the trip and not ruin our good shoes. Susie's mother, in the dream, was the complete opposite to what she really is. She was fat, tall, and dark, and Susie's mother is thin, like all Chinese, and therefore she couldn't be dark.

As I look for some, she seems to become more ragged and poverty-stricken (at first she had on a quite fancy evening gown). I look for clothes for her too (she also becomes younger and younger). Somehow we never go. Then it is a day, we are going into town. There is a grocery, and a man is arranging some candy he has just gotten. He mumbles something about, ""According to Hume...."" and I figure he is a former professor of philosophy who has gotten trapped in this little town with nothing to do but be a grocer.

"I was in a small subterranean city. Inside this city there were houses, buildings, cafes, restaurants, etc. First I was taking some refreshments with some friends: Agnes (a friend, Psychology student); Amery (classmate and friend); Louise (friend and classmate). There were two more boys whose faces I did not recognize. The owner of the café was a boy named Ernest (a fellow worker of my mother), who had something against me. After finishing the refreshments, we came out of the café, and each one went his own way. I was still terribly hungry, and since I had no money, I had to go back to the café and steal two sandwiches. Ernest realized that I stole them and he started to chase me. I don't remember how I evaded him, but suddenly I found myself walking beside Agnes. I was telling her what had happened and was trying to justify my bad action by telling her of the hunger that I had felt at that moment. Behind us there was a boy whose face I did not know, who had a penetrating glance and blue eyes. He listened to all that Agnes and I were saying. Ernest, who had disappeared from the scene, reappeared, infuriated, in front of us. He kept on chasing me. I ran and ran until I could no longer run and I let myself be stopped by some policemen who were nearby. They told me that I had committed an unforgivable offense and that they would give me a death sentence. Suddenly the boy who had been following Agnes and me appeared and stated that my theft had not been voluntary, but rather motivated by the hunger I had felt. He made them see that they would have done the same thing under similar circumstances and that, therefore, it would not be fair to put me in jail. In spite of his speech, which was very convincing, he was not able to make them let me go. Desperate, I was able to run to the main exit of that small city, which led into a more highly developed one. In order to cross the threshold it was necessary for me to climb over steep terrain and avoid being caught by the policemen. Little by little I climbed until I finally arrived at the other city. Everything seemed to be more full of life, there was much more happiness. There were children who laughed openly, and lovers strolling through the green and flowery fields.",Negative

"Murderous Retaliation To Torture  I'm at home in the kitchen. Two men with handguns are there. Another person and I are guarding these men. They are supposed to be our captors, but we seem to be the one who has captured them. We allow them to have handguns but we can't overtly tell them of make them give us their guns, or they'll react violently. One of the men has his gun pointed directly at me. Fire and flames come out of the barrel. They feel intensely hot! The man is torturing me. If I move, he will shoot me, and if I don't, he will torture me with fire. I feel intense pain, but think this is better than being shot. As this continues I feel my energy building, and being held back. At one moment both men have laid their guns on the table. I spring from my seat and attack the men with all the fury and rage that I can muster. The struggle is brief and intense. I kill both men. My sister Heather has also died as a result of my rage. There is a soda pop fountain dispenser there with the Coke emblem on it. The dispenser is razed in my rage: ripped apart. There is a thin white drainage tube in the dispenser. Chloride drips and collects in a tube in the spill tray. This chloride will kill a person. I handle this destroyed dispenser and some liquid out of the plastic tube. I then spit the liquid out and rinse my mouth out with water, thinking that I could have just ingested chloride. I sit in the living room. The fight is over. I lazily read a magazine, wearing my boxer shorts. People are dead, so I guess I should notify the authorities. I call 911. A woman answers and I tell her there has been a sexual torture and murder-I am both the torture victim and murderer. I explain this to a woman very calmly and she tells me authorities are on the way. I wonder if I will be punished for killing them as retaliation for their torture. I walk in the house and wait for the police to arrive. I'm in the living room. I look into the kitchen and see one of the men, who is white. The other man may be black. The man gets partially up, resting his head on his hands, looking at me. He's alive! I'm terrified. He will kill me. I run out the front door of the house, and know that he goes out the back door. I run around the north side of my neighbors the Stein's house. I near a man coming around from the alley, calling out to me. The voice I hear is from my classmate Jackie Hunter. I am in great danger. I need to stay alive until the police arrive. I hope that the police hurry here. I think I see a car drive east on 2nd Street across Home Avenue. It's spray painted with multi-colors, like my housemate Stephen's old car.

"I was visiting home. Mom and Dad had a huge old white house, sort of like ours now except it was on a large field with a forest in the distance. I was supposed to be flying home that day. I noticed that the sky was getting a little dark and the wind was picking up. I wondered what this might do to an airplane in the sky. The wind was getting stronger and stronger - almost viscious. I looked to the trees as indication. They weren't even swaying, they were being blown and bent. The trees were bent half the way over. I couldn't believe how strong this wind was.  There was a stream in our field. The wind was pushing the water and making tidal waves. The wind was a continuous thing but more like one strong travelling gust that was blowing everything in it's path. The gust was approaching and water was everywhere. When it finally passed, I watched it push the water of the stream so that huge rapids formed. After it passed the water receded like a wave on the beach.  We went outside and found all of these army greenish metallic pods on the ground about the size of a smushed softball. I broke one open and it was black inside like charcoal. The green skin was soft. I dont know what they were but they were left over from the big wind storm.  I was at a sort of inside picnic. Set up with table of families I've know in the past....the Martinez's, the Jenkins. I was given a plate of sort of TV dinner'ish turkey and mashed potatoes. I hardly ate a thing because I was talking the whole time about the big wind. No one seemed to be interested.  I went over to the table where Camilla and Jenkins sat. They had had a new baby that I wanted to see. It was a little boy that looked just like Richard. He must've been the size of my thumb and he was sitting in one of those baby harnesses in a tea cup filled with milk. I went to touch him - everyone jumped. The teacup was broken - right in straight halves and they had been balancing together somehow holding the milk. When I touched it the milk went all over. They seemed annoyed so I said I'd go get some more milk and maybe a container if I could find one.  I was at a store. I think there were a whole bunch of raver-type people there. I saw Dolores in a bathroom. We didn't have much to say. I asked her what she was doing now and she said ""working for peace"".  I go to a party with Jessica and someone else. We all take Ecstasy and go to the 1st floor of this place. Not much is going on and I dont feel anything. There's hardly anyone around and no music. I think I hear stuff going on on the 3rd floor so we begin to go. On the way I see a guy with a bunch of packages. One is for me from my mother. Inside are 8 or 9 E's. A crowd starts to form around the guy and he throws a few E's out. I catch one. Walking away back to Jessica, people are throwing balls around. I keep catching a lot of them with that nice hard smack in the hand. We go upstairs and nothing's up except Diane is there and Yelena from work is trying to get people to sign up for the World Health Organization. I try to avoid her because I don't like her. I still can't feel anything. I think about my mom sending me the pills and conclude that she looked it up in her nursing medicine books. All of sudden the party is over and people are leaving. [The Martinez's, Camilla and Jenkins = families of my bestfriends from 4th through 8th grade; Richard Jenkins = The Jenkins' son; Dolores = best friend in the 4th grade; Diane = an aquaintence from college that I was never really friends with; Yelena = woman I worked with that I didn't like; Jessica = my best friend since college]",Negative

I am happy they like it and assure them I will be happy to edit it. I know it needs it. Now I am looking at a survey Lucy has filled out. I read her answers and decide I will answer the same way. I notice she checked on the SEX question that 50% of the time she has sex alone, 40% of the time, sometimes with people and 10% of the time she has sex with someone.

"This dream has the atmosphere of foreign intrigue.  I meet some girl at a beach, not Bayview Beach, though.  We get along pretty well, but I then I see her smoking, with some older bald-headed man.  It turns out that they are spies, or criminals, or something.  We know that they have taken a cab.  I ask Daddy if it was a Yellow Cab, or what kind it was.  He says it was just a plain drab colored kind of cab.  He, Jimmy Duggan, some other people, and I station ourselves at various points in the city, and feel almost sure of finding them.  Frustratingly, I have a lot of trouble seeing-everything is fuzzy or cloudy.  Finally we go home and wait for something to turn up.  I look at a rack of my clothes and wonder what to put on.  I don't want to wear the same blue shirt with the black squares.  I catch sight of a really pretty blue one that I have forgotten about having.  I look closer and it is two notebook paper wrappers with the name of my hometown newspaper written on them.  Inside each is a small pad of blank paper.",Negative
"I was roaming about in a ravine which was quite similar to the one that surrounded the junior high school I once attended. I think that I actually had the feeling that it was the same one, but at the same time, it seemed to be near Reserve.

At the same time that he was lecturing, the boy in back of me was approximately my own age, was brushing his hair and this seemed very natural at the time. I also remember noticing a blond girl sitting to the front and right of me who was said to be very attractive, but whose face I could not see.",Positive
I was experimenting with stain removal on carpet. May be related to waking life paint stains on Matthew's carpet. It had something to do with the oxygen from my breath and timing.

I gather up all my strength and yell, ""You'd better sit down and right now!"" He just melts like a scared pup into the chair. I walk away feeling some pride at winning.

"I was driving in a car with 2 other people, 2 men, males. I don't remember who they were or their ages, whether they were friends or unknown people, but the three of us were driving to go to either to perform a robbery, a hold up, perhaps a murder, I don't remember which, and we were on our way across a causeway, perhaps McArthur Causeway, I'm not sure. I noticed as we were driving down the causeway there was a boy riding on a bike, a young boy perhaps 6 or 7 years old, 8, and a man in a car, I don't remember what he looked like either, but a man about 35 or 40, who I had never seen before, kind of was riding alongside the boy. The boy was riding on a bike on the causeway. The man looked out the window and patted the boy on the head and told the boy to pull over to the side of the road. Evidently by this time we had passed them and I was watching in the rear view mirror. So I knew that something was fishy about this, that the man was trying to tempt the boy to get into his car perhaps. So I told the men that I was with that we had better turn around and see what was going on so we stopped there and the man was talking to the boy and he said to him come on get in the car. Obviously he knew we meant business or we had caught him doing something wrong because he got immediately in the car and we drove off with him. We were trying to figure out what to do. I said we should take him to the police, but the other men didn't want to do that, mainly because I suppose I think we had guns ourselves with us and we were going as I say to make, perform this robbery, or hold up or whatever. So we decided not to and we just dropped him off when we got off the causeway. We figured it would take him a few hours to get back to his car and by that time the boy would have gone. That was the end of the home dream.",Negative

"I dreamed that I was spending some vacation with Gianna. She was living in this humungous house and her dad was really rich and worked for NASA. In one room there were a lot of beds all lined up against the wall. People were lying on the beds, and each had on a pair of shin guards. Underneath their shin guards were their stories and how they had been injured and why they were lying on these beds. Whenever Gianna or I lifted the shin guards to read the story, however, they woke up and started laughing at us. Then they made some sarcastic comment that was supposed to be satirical and making fun of a movie. Gianna and I realized that we were on the set of Scary Movie 3, and that's why everyone was making satirical comments. When we got to the last bed, a woman leapt out of nowhere and grabbed the shin guards away from us. She asked us if we had tried them on, and we said no. She then told us that it was a pair of deadly shin guards, and that whoever tried them on died the next day. Gianna and I went back to the main part of her house where a lot of maids were cleaning the tile floor. We started to watch a DVD before her dad came in and told us he had to leave again. Gianna was really upset. He got into this enormous truck and began to back out of the driveway before he began to fly and took off into the stars. Gianna and I went into another room where there was a fruit snacks factory. A large pipe would deposit fruit snacks into bags in short intervals. The pipe had been clogged and everyone was trying to fix it. Then this dream ended and I began another one where I was in Paris. Some friends and I were walking down a small street and spotted a good-looking cafe. We went inside and it turned out to be a sort of cafe/ice cream parlor/bakery/candy shop. We all went inside and tried to decide what to have. They had some of the weirdest candy, like ""Antique M&Ms;,"" where there was fruit inside the chocolate part. I went to go buy an ice cream cone, a coffee, and iced tea. I spilled the coffee as soon as I got it. Not wanting to pay for another. I filled it up with water and complained that they had given me water instead of coffee. They refilled it for me, and then I woke up.",Negative

I suddenly realized that we had not lived in this apartment for years and I had walked into someone else's apartment and made myself at home. So I was kind of embarrassed. Then I met my grandfather who actually has been dead for 10 years or more now, although I didn't realize this in the dream. He and I went on uptown to get something to eat. We went into several food stores and apparently my grandfather's idea of getting something to eat involved buying a loaf of bread and some raw hamburger or something like that. He was being very economical. He was always doing for his economical traits, to put it mildly, while he was alive. I wanted to go on and actually find a restaurant.",Negative

Followed him through a bad party of town into a room down an alley.  They assigned me to a table.  It was a severe-case detox facility.  The people were volatile; it was scary.  True danger.  We barely escaped.  Then, I was telling my parents about Willy.  Something romantic was growing between us.  And of course there was talking with my boyfriend Jeremy.  I had a decision to make.  Love with Jeremy is strong, developed.  The situation with Willy had a spark.  He was tender, and it seemed like a good prospect.  Later in the same dream, I had to get a goblet of holy water.  I was trying to take it outside to someone without spilling.  Outside I crossed a bridge and started to cross another, going horizontally.  They were trying to dispose of a rocket about to go off.

I don't remember what else happened with that. We were changing Rachel S's diaper and she had a big growth near her genitals and I was afraid to ask Bev about it.

My elephant stops to get a drink and fills his trunk up with cold water and sprays it back over himself for a cooling bath. ""Oh, no,"" I groan and try to avoid a bath. I help rub the water over his skin.",Positive
I watched the sunrise. There were red flames and you could watch without hurting your eyes. I asked Mom if she had seen it and she said she hadn't. I had taken a photo. Darren was there. The house was like the old house. I was in the bathroom and Mom came in and she had extra rings on. They were silver diamond-y ones (like gangster's wear).,Negative
"I was in a strange hospital built like a museum. I called a colored patient on the ward named Shepherd. Later an officer from a former ward I had been on appeared in the dream. He looked on as blood began coming out of my mouth. (This officer's name was McCruden. An incident which led to my being involved in a plot to escape happened on that ward. Mr. McCruden was in charge of the ward when the plot was uncovered. This happened in December, 1960. It left me with a sad memory.)",Negative
"I am somewhere in Florida in a gulf city and trying to reach the beach. Looking at a map, I see that most roads lead toward the water, but that only one or two actually pass over causeways directly to water. Next am in a small boat in one of the bays between the beach keys and the mainland. I drop a flat, yellow plastic box in the water by accident and it sinks. Then boat suddenly touches bottom. A shark flashes by and then turns back and heads for boat. To say the least, I am frightened because boat seems stuck.",Negative
"I was stocktaking in a big clothes warehouse. There were rows and rows of clothes up to the ceilings and I was hoping someone else would have to do them because I didn't want to have to keep climbing up ladders. The supervisor of the job didn't have enough guns for everyone to be scanning at once, so some of us were wandering around trying to find something to do. At one point me and another guy were tidying up some of the floor racks that had clothes just piled on top. Later, we started taking barcodes out, and then the supervisor gave us check sheets - which was like a map of the area with houses and the houses represented something or other. There was some house where these twins lived and they had an exact copy of themselves (so 4) and each pair shared a bed. Anyway, later I was doing some more wandering, when the supervisor said we needed more people to be guarding the entrances and she referred to me as the 'sheriff' and put me at the front entrance. There were zombies or demons or something around. I wasn't particularly scared, just slightly nervous (apparently used to this). I walked back and forth for a few minutes, when I saw a group of 4 of them in a line shuffling backwards towards us (two of them had been our staff, another one of the warehouse's staff and they'd been possessed. Pretty sure they were demons since they were intelligent, but we called them zombies). I ran in and called out and said 'there's 4 in a line coming towards us!' and she told me to sound the alarm. There was a big red button on the wall and I pressed it. The alarm sounded and people just came out of nowhere grabbing weapons. I got a rifle but it had no ammo and I was still looking in the bag of ammo, putting some into the gun (it only held 2 at a time) when they entered the room. There were 2-3 entrances on each side of the building. One was near me and a demon came through and I shot him right in the head. Lots more kept coming. There was also a building next door (about 5 metres from this one, exactly the same) that sounded like they were getting slaughtered. When we'd finished them all off, we looked next door and no-one was left alive. Then shadows started going weird and these things that are hard to describe, but sort of like a stapler remover - there wasn't much to them, they were solid black and had one sharp pointer on the top and bottom. They also had this deafening squeal. They were shoving their pointers into people's legs and such and dragging them off. One stabbed me in my leg and it hurt like hell and they didn't seem to respond to the guns. I then had a knife or something which seemed to get rid of it.",Negative
"These two guys were walking away and these two other guys walked the other way and said something to them. They realized they had had sex with them. One of them looked like Ryan Merriman. The two guys went to the shop and were getting stuff plus something to do with sex and they were embarrassed about it. They were looking at stuff and I mouthed to the store guy ""call out"" so he did. I was looking at the ice-cream and most of the tubs had lids off.",Negative
I was at Nana's. The cops were searching for drugs. They said they found some and I protested. I ended up with some girl on the run from someone. There was a guy with raccoon eyes and he went into our place. We ducked into this abandoned shop. There was nowhere to go and I hid behind the counter. He came in with goons and looked around but didn't find me. We now had Kurt from Glee with us. As he went to leave he said something and two guys found us and tried to get us and we fought them and ran. There were guards outside. They moved and we left. We went into a shop through the back windows. It was a Muslim shop with food shops etc inside. They came in after us and had to make small talk with people as they made their way through. I bought water at one place. We went into a clothes shop and changed our clothes quickly (it was in a montage). At the end of the montage I was wearing a big black coat and high heel boots. The guys found us and we fought again. Then we all talked.,Negative

Either I have shaved them when I was really drunk and don't remember, or someone else has cut them off without my knowing! I'm upset. I really wanted to have good length, full sideburns, even if trimmed. Whoever cut them off shaved off too much the bottom for me to trim them while still leaving them all along the side of my face.

"I was working for NTNS but we were in a huge warehouse. I had been cleaning up and organizing. I found some racks with children's clothing so I rolled them over to the children's section intending to transfer them later. When I went back to do it, Darren was there doing it. I went on cleaning up. I was finding lots of racks with wheels that we didn't know we had. I ran into a stock boy also cleaning up, moving things, and throwing things away. We had a discussion about why they had saved all this stuff. I was then approached by one of the committee chairs about a problem. It seems someone had given two families a very large amount of clothing free and used my name. I tried to tell her I didn't do it. I finally found out that Darren and Angie Ho were responsible for one and a woman named Debbie [unknown in waking life] the other. Darren and Angie were operating as an independent agency helping the underprivileged. They helped themselves to our stock. They did have an office our building. Even after we told Angie Ho she couldn't do this, she continued under a disguise and alias. I finally caught her and turned her in. Also, she was posing as a government employee giving advice on raising and caring for children. I reported her as unqualified and mentioned that BJ would be great for this kind of work. The committee chair still did not believe me. We found Debbie, but it was her word against mine and the committee chair believed her. I found many different rooms on different levels, piled with boxes full of supplies, racks, etc. I also wound my way around an upstairs workroom and back out again.",Negative
"The time was afternoon, and no train had passed for several hours, and there should be one along any minute now. I walked through the gate on to first track and look to the right. A train can be seen in the distance. I suddenly remember that the noise of one train sometimes drowns out the noise of one coming from opposite direction, and such an occurrence now might get me run down, so I step off of track to watch the oncoming train. It proves to be a freight. First, there are a couple of box cars, then a small engine (much like a switch engine); then a very big freight locomotive which I want to see more clearly. Opposite where I stand is a ""cut,"" and in some way this shuts off my view of lower portion of the big engine, and I am unable to see its drive wheels, which are what I am most interested in. First 3 or 4 cars beyond engines are flat cars filled with black men, evidently laborers. Rest of train is made up of flat cars loaded with wood -- mostly stumps, logs, limbs, etc. -- which apparently was picked up in some timber along the tracks. Some of the stumps show signs of having been trimmed before being loaded -- i.e., the roots are all cut off at about some length, and some of the roots ""evened up.""",Negative
"I was in a car with a young Kiefer Sutherland and some others. We found out that I may have been related to him. He went to this neighbourhood, which was creepy, to look for an old lady. The houses were all falling apart and some had skeletons (real) hanging on the front of their doors. We went into this house and a female friend got left behind (we had to run to the car). Kiefer was talking about 'breeding' with me. His house was huge. Chloe (24) was there. She met with this guy on a balcony. Someone got a mint chocolate chip mint ice-cream and I decided I wanted one. We all went to get one. It was dark and the place was closed. It had animals in cages. We opened the cage and then had to put the animals back. Mom, Dad and Ezra were there. Mom was behind us.

"Dorothy S, her husband, and I buy a house together. We're beginning to move things. I was going through my kitchen things trying to determine what to keep and move with me and what to get rid of. I suggested to Dorothy S that since she cooks so, so much more than I do that I thought it would be best if she took care of moving things into the new kitchen. I wanted it to be comfortable for her since I do little in the kitchen. She agreed with that. I was going to get some linens and make the beds but then I realized that we had only moved one bed in, in a guest room, because we all still had at least one more night sleeping in ours at our old homes. My older and middle brother were both there helping, along with some other people. Bill F and I are someplace that looks kind of like a storage facility, but it is part of where I've been living. In one part of this building there are inside walls that do not go all the way to the ceiling but are connected with a horizontal surface. I had stored some of my things up there. Most of the things up there were filthy, dirty. Bill F was sitting on this surface at the corner where the two inner walls join. I was standing on a high rung of a wall ladder that went up the side of the shorter of the two inner walls. I was standing so my waist cleared the top of the ladder. A third person, I think it was Matthew, was walking around up there, bringing the things over to Bill F and I. I would decide whether to keep it or save it and then Bill F would act accordingly. Matthew brought me something that looked like a painting or a similar type of wall-hanging. The back was covered with a think layer of grey dust. Then he brought me another and this one was even worse. It was covered with not only the thick layer of grey dust but also large dust balls. Bill F knocked a couple of the dust balls off. Matthew and Bill F thought I would tell them to throw them both away because they were both so dirty. I told them I definitely wanted to save them as I really liked them and they had a lot of value to me.",Positive

"Last night I had a dream about Aaron and Britta again. It was similar to the last dream I had about them, in that Aaron wanted me to be friends with Britta, and he didn't try to hide her or anything to spare my feelings. He just outright showed affection for her and everything. And again, I just felt so helpless, like I couldn't do anything to make myself feel better or change the situation, because I wanted to be with Aaron, but I also wanted to stay friends with him, so I had to be friends with Britta. The dream was odd though because Britta wasn't a pretty blonde girl, but rather a tiny Vietnamese girl. And I liked her. And even though she was the Britta, Aaron's Britta, there was some part of her that secretly wasn't. It was weird, but I knew this to be true. Anyway, this is all so stupid because it shows that I am just anxious about seeing Aaron again and worried that he will have gotten back with Britta.",Negative

"There had been a lecture going on earlier about projective drawings. The instructor, who was a male, had been talking about pre- and post-test results and he had been talking about one particular case which I think was a murder or some other type of criminal protocol. Somewhere along the line I had been a subject in a hypnosis experiment and it seems as if some drawings were going to be made by me while hypnotized, but I had not achieved a sufficiently deep state of trance. I had not quite awakened, but I did not seem able to progress any deeper into the trance. The hypnotist was saying something about if I had enough confidence, I could let my eyes roll to the back of my head and this would produce the desired depth of trance. I'm not sure whether the hypnotist was also the instructor or not. Then it seemed as if I was almost awake and the instructor was holding up an ink blot to the class and asking them what factors or what determinants could be used on this particular card. He then asked this question specifically of one girl in class, but she did not reply immediately, and one of the men to her right spoke up and said that you could use color, shading and texture. The card had some purple coloring on it. The class seemed to contain about 20 or 30 adult students. Then it seemed as if a voice were reading a protocol and at the same time an ink blot was in sight, so that the students could know which areas of the card were involved as the voice described different details of the protocol. One thing mentioned was at one part of the card there were two mice that were colored purple, and then there was an explanation of how they came to have this unusual color along with an explanation of how the scoring for each dream was determined.",Positive

Merle and I are in a gym kind of room. We're trying on other people's impediments. Merle has arm braces on and then a furry fake animal fur arm covering. I am to wear the furry covering on my arms. I have a hard time putting them on. They are long and floppy and I can't do much with them on. I think it would have been better if I'd put the metal braces on.,Positive

He seems friendly and helpful. I feel relieved he's in a good mood.",Negative
"I was at home. Dad and Ezra were there. Dad said he was going to go out (it was night), so I asked Mom to bring food over. She came over and this cop car went past slowly. It was being dodgy so we swapped Mom's car for mine and then these guys turned up and pointed a gun at Mom's head and mine until they got something. I don't know what happened but they left and we they got back they said the cops pulled them over. I was telling Dad, who was watching something, that the guy on the show he was watching was in Monty Python and that he was my favourite Python (obviously, Michael Palin) and that it was his birthday tomorrow.",Positive
"This dream was short, very vivid and made a deep impression. It took place in a very dingy and depressing room which was about 20 ft. square. The room was part of a prison. One wall was lined with bunks five high. I was in the top bunk. A door was in the wall that was perpendicular to the beds. The room was not painted and was not plastered but covered with cement and had the gloomy gray color of cement. The blankets of the bed were pulled up to my neck and were of a blackish gray. A guard (whom I didn't know and whose age I didn't notice) came into the room with a package for me. I tried to get out of the bunk to get the package. I threw the covers back but I couldn't get down to the floor.",Negative
"I was walking near the city auditorium and church. It is twilight. a police car comes by with large 8 foot by 8 foot board on it with curved edges--like plywood with holes in it, curved as with steam to make it bend into wings. I looked up in the sky and the same piece is sailing upwards where it hovers like a martin, kite, or prehistoric flying monster half a mile up. I assumed it took off when cops came around the corner too fast and an updraft lifted it like a glider. Then it swoops down with a graceful parabolic curve, just clearing my head, and it enters a house ... and I know it is a steel sheet. It goes right through the wall of the house, parallel with porch, through the picture window where I see people playing cards. It travels at table-top level and I assume came to rest beyond the house in an alley. I do not go in, knowing the dead bodies and ugly destruction. I don't want to be a gaping curiosity-seeker. Later I read in a paper where five people killed, when it caught them playing cards in the early evening.",Negative

We had a fight and he kept hiding in nooks in the birdcage, but a friend and I got him.",Positive
"I was in a carpark. Dad was with mafia kind of people. They were taking my car somewhere and they gave me this other car in the meantime, but there wasn't much space between cars and it was squishy to get in. Then we were at Midvale shops. I parked at the side of the road and checked the map book. I told people to go. I was then with characters from Friends. I was dating Chandler and Rachel was dating Ross. Monica was with someone too. Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey, Ross and I went shopping. Rachel and Monica bought lots of clothes for their boyfriends. I kept leaving my wallet in random places. We were in the sleepwear section and Monica and Rachel were like 'oh we should buy the guys pyjamas' but the guys weren't interested. The pyjamas were folded on shelves and I touched one of them. It was soft and slightly silky and unlike anything I'd ever touched before and I called them over. The guys touched it and wanted one each. The girls ended up choosing this other one which was just as soft. Then they were shoes and they had pink and I chose blue. The pink one also had green and were very child-like.",Negative
"I had to take an Ethics exam, and I didn't know a thing. My mind was a blank, and I could feel the professor looking closely at me, thinking I was trying to cheat, but this was not true. But I was moving so much in the desk, and wasn't writing, that he must have thought I was. It was an hour filled with anguish, but then I laughed a lot because they told me I had gotten a very good grade. I laughed because I hadn't written anything down. Afterwards, I felt terrible because my mother told me that they had probably given me someone else's grade. Then I don't know what happened. There were lots of dolls and my mother told me to pick out one, but they were all so pretty that I couldn't decide. Then I saw a doll who was looking at me with tears coming out of her eyes. It was a doll with a baby. It was a pink doll, with short, curly and messed up hair, and it didn't have any clothes, only the ticket in her hand. I chose that one, and they didn't want to sell it to me and all the other dolls were laughing. And then it seemed to me I wasn't in a doll store any more, but in a place with lots of babies who were crying, and I got frightened and I don't know what happened.",Negative

"I don't know where we were, but Raquel and I were far away (like a few hours drive). The train only came every 1-2 hours. There was one coming in a few minutes but she decided to catch a ride back instead. There was a big truck thing and a fat dude was driving. We asked if he was going into town and he asked where we were going and we replied ""Centerville"". We had to sit in the back. Raquel jumped out after about one minute. I told him to stop and I tried to go after her but I had to run through some sand and it was hard to run. She pulled up with a Ute and I got in. We then tried to get on the freeway, but ended up at a factory place. There was lots of smoke and we had to drive through it, so we wound up the windows. It started coming through the aircon (which didn't work). I said that I got lost here once with Mom. I was then out of the car hanging around outside the factory. There was a box of kittens and they were really cute. Someone called my name and it was Ezra and he was moving sand?",Negative
"The SAID sponsor committee. Some kind of document, or information, that most people don't see and something about the difficult things that need to stay hidden from most people. I either need to make sure I keep it to myself or we need to make sure it stays within a very small group of people. There was something about recognizing people close to us, like family members who support us during the difficult parts of being an SAID volunteer. Recognizing how important that support is, how much we value it. I said something about someone in my life. I don't recall identifying who that someone was. I have a sense that it wasn't Matthew, but it had to be him. I said something about him being my torch bearer. As soon as I said it I realized how accurate it was. It made me that much more aware of how important that person is and how much I value their mental and emotional support, especially with this part of my life. It was related to him even just listening and how valuable that is to me and wanting to recognize him for that, to make sure that he knows how valuable that is to me, how important it is to me.",Positive
"Mom and I were at some weird place in the forest. It was dark. There were these hamster like animals with long snouts. They were doing some weird things, so Mom left a note on the cage saying that they had fallen and hit their head. We got a lighter, some gas and a lantern and it made a little explosion when we put them together. We then had light. We were walking down a path and if we leant forward and walked a bit faster, we would suddenly just go really fast, so we did that. Then we were at a village with a place to sleep. Then it was Eugene and I. We were in a room. He was in bed and there was another me and I was watching her. She was like ""Oh, I need my cappuccino"" and Eugene and I were like 'what the flip?'. He couldn't see me. I realized I'd been 'separated' and had changed the part of me that didn't like coffee. It was sometimes a game and I was little and jumped onto the bed and collected coins. Then I went in the kitchen and collected the coins in there. Then Ezra, Mom, Dmitri, Eugene and I were in a car. Mom went to a petrol station and Dmitri was in the driver's seat. This guy went to Ezra's side and asked him to write a note about the car and started going to the driver's side to take it. I locked the doors and then I was in the driver's seat and I took off. I was going really fast, but the guy went into a car and was following me. We ended up in a shop, still driving, and the cops were chasing me.

Behind us there was a fighter jet that had been hit by the Iraqi army and was on its way toward crashing into the ground.  I woke up temporarily.

Anderson asks if there isn't a heater on the car, as the weather is snappy. He has a screwdriver and is opening the heater vent, but I explain there is another ""valve"" or cut-off next to the engine, and until this is adjusted very little heat will come through. We reach the entrance to a bridge leading off to right, and though I somehow believe we should turn on to this bridge, I finally continue straight ahead. This second bridge is a makeshift affair, partly resting on roofs of houses. Presently we enter a large court, surrounded by buildings. I ask Chester where we are but he doesn't answer. I repeat the question several times and then realize Chester left the car sometime back; and I am rather annoyed by the failure of the person in back seat to tell me when Chester left.",Negative

The guys around me start scrambling to pick up the other bills. I shove a bunch in my pocket. One of the guys takes a $20 bill out of my pocket. I catch him and take it back. There are a few little kids trying to take photographs of me as I leave, as if I have done something wrong. I go into Carter School and a kid follows me in.

I identify with him, saying I took a class nearly the same, but nothing happened with chickens. I walk past the entrance of grandma and grandpa's room. The door is open and the bed is shaggily made: grandpa is getting older and doesn't bother to tuck in the edges. My mom walks out of the entrance hall into their room. She is wearing only a sweater. It goes down over her hips. It looks like she is wearing only that. She asks grandma and grandpa to borrow a pair of pants, because she's cold. I say she can borrow on of mine, that I'll have one that will fit. My mom is running in a race later that night.",Positive
"Cliff S returns. I was one person on a team that was helping to run an event. Cliff S was also on the team. He was single again and had heard that I was too. He came up to me and gave me his high school class ring. He had ordered two of them, way back then, and had been keeping one to give to me some day. He was wearing one of them and it looked normal. The one he had saved for me looked just like and it didn't. The stone in it was a couple of inches high, reminding me almost of an obelisk. The stone was ruby red, just like the stones in our class rings. I was thinking about the fact that we never did get that first date that he wanted so long ago.

Everyone was very happy and she was to start attaining her divorce the day after this party. Her husband came to the party but left very early (as he always does).

"Free Hotel Soap  I'm with a man and a woman going to a hotel for one night. We must draw a map for our driver so he knows how to get to the airport in the morning so we can catch our flight to Australia. We have a city map of Melbourne. We take it out and give directions: Take highway 19 into Melbourne to the airport. Then we drive in a large limousine-like vehicle. We arrive at a large, fancy hotel. I am with my friend Matt Yams in the Grocery Getto parking lot in Oak Valley. We have driven a small car there and parked in the northeast corner of the lot near the bus stop. There is a van parked to our right, and a car to our left. Matt has gone in the store. I need to urinate. I look to do this by the car, shielding myself from view. The people driving the van return to their vehicle and drive away. Matt comes out of the store looking very clean. He has showered and is wearing a white shirt with a blue apron. We're in a hotel room bathroom. There are a few inches of dirty, soapy water draining out of the bathtub. I ask Matt if that was from his shower. He says yes. I pick up a nice washcloth and some large bars of soap to take with me. There are five or six bars of soap around; I take three or four of them. I ask Matt what time we're getting up in the morning. He says half past six. I say, ""6:30?"" He says yes. I figure that gives us one and a half hours to get to the airport, which is plenty of time. We seem to need to be there at 7:00 or 5:00am. I'm in the break room at Grocery Getto. I quit my job there, along with another man. The man has some stuff in his locker that belongs to another employee. A coworker, Todd Mohs, is there.

"It was like Civilisation IV. I decided to build a city, except it was more like a cottage next to a road. Then Ezra and I were in a car there at night. I plugged a cord into a power point on a pole. We parked under the street light. I put the seat down and tried to sleep. Ezra heard a noise. There was a dark house behind us and there were bushes rustling. I turned the car on (it was a US car) and drove around and chased some guy. Then we were walking and Rover was with us. A lady from the house was near our car and let us in. Rover wandered out and I couldn't find Ezra. I went in and realized they were dodgy and ran. I picked up some thin sticks. We were together again and went back, but nothing was there. Eventually we realized we were trapped there. My tooth was wobbly and I pulled it out. There was a young cheerleader girl. A guy who looked like Michael Cera was also in the first season of Arrested Development and he wanted to lose his virginity. An older lady said she'd do it. Then a guy at some place took this girl into his room and told her to do something and she was allowed to wish for something. He had sex with two women and at the end cried out ""Oh shit! Fuck!"".

We are both pretending the valentine isn't for me and I am actually confused if it is or not, so I pretend nonchalantly, then I gather up some belongings I'd been collecting.

I think about protesting but let it go. Now I'm on a bus. A young, good-looking man named John is standing. He wants to dance. I go to him and offer to dance with him. I take his hand, the opposite way from normal. I am the girl, so my right arm should be out, but I take the lead with my left arm. I say in a way of explanation, ""Oh well, it's my dream, after all."" Then I change so he has the lead and I say, ""I guess it is John's dream, really."" We dance. I pull us cheek to cheek. He hesitates and pulls back slightly. He tells me a long, polite story. I say, ""Well, I guess what you are saying is that I'm good looking for an older woman."" He didn't want to hurt my feelings. I say, ""I don't feel it. I don't like it, but it is true."" I let go and walk to the front of the bus to watch the scenery. Several women and the male bus driver are singing. I join in, loudly harmonizing, showing off for John in the back of the bus. Suddenly there are bushes across the road. We drive through them, not even slowing down. But with a sense of shock I see that the road has suddenly ended in a huge lake and the bus is free floating through the air and crashes in the water. I say, ""Open the door so we can swim out before we drown."" The driver opens the door and we get out. Lucy is afraid. I reassure her. We paddle toward shore, which is close by. I notice the water is muddy and I then stand. The water is only waist deep; there is no danger after all. Then, someone says, ""Look! A water fall,"" and they all go wading down the shoreline toward a thunderous, huge water fall. I say, ""Oh, oh"" because I will follow them and don't feel comfortable about wading in unknown muddy water. I could step in a deep hole and be in trouble, but I go anyway. Now it's a highway again that ends at a cliff edge that is glassed in. We stand and look down to see this waterfall. The people are in my way and now the glass wall is only 3' high and down a slope. I lay down on my belly and scoot in closer. All I see is an empty cafe with a sheet of water coming down the far wall. Pretty tame. I go up one level to see if I can get a better glimpse. This time the far wall is beautifully carved like natural rock formations in the form of two bear faces. I go up to the top level and still can't see the full waterfall.",Negative

They Eugene came with this big blowup like thing. They caught him so we opened the doors and let him in. We got down and ran to the car and then left. We were in my car and I didn't have much petrol. We ended up falling off a cliff but we were okay. We went back to Eugene's building. Then I was at this hole in the wall where I had put stuff when I was younger - stuff that was worth money such as drugs, rocks, a big fat fish and 'dog' fish (which were cute).",Negative
"I dreamt I was about to get married and at the last minute I changed my mind. I was embarrassed about the fuss it was making, and afraid of what my mother would say. In my dream though I knew that not getting married was the right thing to do and that my friends and family would understand.",Negative
"I had a strange dream. Someone named Chuck Mahoney had made an album. It was bad. Someone said, ""Here's his second album. Isn't it lucky someone took a chance on him and laid the money down for a second try? It's really good, his second album."" Then Raul and all the men from my past came in. I felt embarrassed. Then a man and a woman were facing each other. A question was asked of the woman. The man was fervently hoping she'd answer correctly in his favor, but she answered ""money"" and the man was very sad. He looked at me and said, ""In some cases, divorce is very good.""",Negative
"(02/06/01)[""River and cabin dream continues..""] I am in the cabin again. The river is more normal now. I have a 6 or 7 year old daughter. My husband is gone and has been for weeks or months. Traveling on work, I guess. The daughter is cute and smart. She has two neighbor friends (male) over and they are playing. One boy is typing on a toy machine and asking interview questions. I think this will be good skill building for him.",Positive
"I was leaving either work or a performance of some kind, in a big marble building.  I was walking with someone else when I realized I had set my attache case down somewhere and forgotten it.  I went back and couldn't find it.  I spent the rest of the dream looking for it.",Positive
"(01/30/00)[""Saved from the monster.""] I am camping with Dovre. We find a spot and leave the vehicle and walk to another spot. Tall beautiful trees. We are waiting for my parents to join us. A man comes by and shows us a cute squirrel in a tree. He feeds them. He asks to borrow my nightshirt I am wearing. I let him have it and also take off my underpants. Then I feel exposed and ask Dovre to go to the other camp and bring my jeans. She doesn't want to go so she gives me a spare jeans and shirt of hers. I realize later that saved my life because my night shirt was given to a monster who came looking for my scent and would have eaten me if I'd worn my own clothes.",Positive
"Deli Court  I'm about to eat dinner. I look in a refrigerator case. There are some loaves of bread in it. Some of the bread comes with meat: it looks like two small loaves of bread with a clump of sliced meat in between them. There is one loaf of bread for 35 cents. It is from the 36-hour famine. It looks good to me: it's a big, long loaf of soft white bread. I grab one bottle of beer out of the refrigerator. Others are eating with me. I think of getting a beer for each of us: that would be a nice thing for me to do. My old flat mate Glen Ryan and my coworker Herald Jamison are there.  I'm in court, which is a deli. Herald is on trial. My name is called to go to the witness stand. I'm surprised, and feel pressure. I'm sworn in. I put my right hand on a tub of hummus. I hold the tub with my thumb around the edge and my four fingers over the top. I try to keep my hand flat while holding it. The woman bailiff swears me in, asking me if I promise to tell the whole truth. I say, ""I do."" As I'm sworn in, my right hand and arm falls down, it seems as if the bailiff isn't holding the bible (hummus) anymore. I quickly glance at the judge to see if this makes a difference. The judge doesn't flinch, so I guess it's okay. I'm then on the witness stand. It's about six feet square bounded by a one or two-foot high fence made of wood or wire. The judge is to my right, at about 2:00. There are some ovens and some deli cases to the right of the judge. The prosecuting lawyer is questioning me. He is a young blond man. He asks me the name of the deli manager. I say her name is Patty. I don't know her last name, I say. He asks me if I see her in the courtroom. I say no, she isn't here. He then asks me if the inspector is there, meaning the health inspector at Mountain Market. I stand up and look around the courtroom/deli. I really don't know who the inspector is. By process of elimination I come up with a few people in the room who could be the inspector, based upon where people are sitting and whom I know has some other role in the room. I point out one man, and say that could be him. He is wearing a gray sweater and has gray hair. He is a big person. I say I don't really know if he's here: when we work we all have different tasks, and I just haven't taken notice of who he is. The lawyer then asks me several vague and indirect questions. I don't know what he's trying to demonstrate: where he's going with his line of reasoning. I'm very direct with him. I say very firmly, ""Why don't you tell the court where you're going with this."" He arrogantly says that he will. He then brings up my criminal history. I immediately feel threatened and think he may expose my speeding ticket or expired tab citation, or my stealing meat and cheese from the deli. He starts to talk about my life. He is speaking pure lies, trying to degrade my credibility. He says I missed bail three times. I realize that this guy is talking out of his ass: he doesn't have a clue about me. I yawn and stretch and scratch my head in contempt for him. I look around and see my friend Sam Kingsley and a woman who works at Mountain Market. By their facial expressions I know they know that the prosecutor is making it all up. The prosecutor rambles on without making a point. The people who know me know that what he is saying isn't true. My lawyer, who is Herald's lawyer, but seem seems like my lawyer or is on my side-because I seem to be on trial-is a woman with short straight dark hair. She is pretty. As I'm testifying a timer for the ovens go off. Patty, who is near the judge's bench, switches some food, maybe ribs, in the oven as the trial takes place.",Negative
"It was in the middle of the day in the dream and I had just woken up from a nap. I was in a cabin at a camp. I went outside and all the counselors were sitting outside on a picnic table. The counselors were my friendsÑonly about 15 years older, and I was older also. We were all counselors and everyone was really happy. My friends are guys and girls. During the entire dream I was really happy and had this really weird floating feeling, like I was on a cloud. I woke up from the dream feeling really happy, relaxed and just really good.",Positive
"I was at SVSDC. It was a huge, open space, the size of a very large warehouse, and very industrial looking. It felt chaotic and claustrophobic to me as it had stuff everywhere. I can't identify any particular things, just lots of steel. I saw Doctor C. I was happy to see him and he was happy to see me. He made a comment implying that he had decided I wasn't going to go visit him anymore because it had been so long since I had went to see him. No one I knew worked there anymore.",Positive
"I am at the community college again, wondering if they have part-time jobs for counselors. Andrea says maybe in a few years. I am now walking with Jim (dean of something). He likes me and I am distracted a bit. He is showing me some cute things for sale in the community college store. He tries to interest me in looking at things. I realize this is his way of helping us be closer, so I try. He shows me a small ceramic footprint which, when you open it up, is filled with sand. I see a candlestick, black and slim with ceramic cats on it. It is very cute. I am trying to see the prices. Some of the more ornate ones are two or three hundred dollars. The slim one is maybe $10.00. He wants me to go have a salad and sandwich with him at the cafeteria. I feel kind of interested, but not supercharged.",Negative
"I was at a shop. Mom was there. We were there to do a drug deal. Then a fat blob (literally) came and we hid from it. I was with someone, who later was Calvin, and we were crawling and running from the blob. It caught up with us and said it had its stuff. I left. I was trying to call Mom to pick me up but she didn't answer. I was waiting outside and Evelyn was there and she said she'd get her car and get us.",Negative
"I am in the passenger side of a car and we stop to see a piece of furniture in a garage sale on the side of the road. It is a wooden display case that has rows of small drawers or boxes that rotate like a display watch case. I am intrigued and think it will be perfect for my small things and jewelry. I see a large price tag on it that says $89. I think I can afford that so we get out to look. The family that is selling it is very excited and bring me lots of accessory things that go with it free of charge, a large, plastic yellow top which I think looks cheap, and so on. I decide to buy it. Now I see a small chocolate Eskimo pie man who is going out to explore the world. He hops along and I sort of follow. He decides to go into a cafe where this man has gone in. A small tiny woman his size comes out and says, ""Oh, you are my size."" She likes that. He goes on. Inside, he hops into a refrigerated display case, glass, and stands with other stick figure candies. I now go to find the man. I see him settling in at a table and I go sit at the table next to him, pretending I don't see him. He sits down next to me, surprised. He is tall, lanky and dark-haired.",Negative

"I dreamt my 6-month-old niece was eating a big chicken leg (fried). I was alone with her and she started choking on it. I tried to get the chicken leg out of her hand, but she wouldn't let go. Her coughing was loud and deep, like a man's. I was running around the house looking for something to stop the cough, but I never found anything. I was pretty frantic about the whole thing.  I felt excitement and panic and it was unpleasant. The setting was my sister's house, her den and kitchen.",Negative
"I was walking through an area about a mile square. The buildings appeared at first to be all seven stories high. Then I noticed that what appeared to be a sky was the underside of streets built at the seven story level and supported by the buildings. The streets were wall to wall, which gave the appearance of a sky. I went to the upper level. Later, I walked over an overpass, and I passed some caged monkeys.",Positive

I am very disappointed, because I would much rather play with them than with strangers.  We start looking for a place to eat.  There are two cafes in the building, and both of them have a waitress whose body is painted black and white and looks like a cartoon character.",Negative

I am at an inn over 100 years old. Across the street are some people and one of them is a woman who claims she was Alford Packer.

He is making it difficult for me to interview the woman because he keeps putting her down.,Positive
"I was at the beach. The waves were getting bigger and bigger and I started walking away. They were massive by this point and I started to run. Dad took us to his house and I said it wouldn't be safe and that I had had dreams before of huge waves. There was a big window and we saw the wave come crashing through. We started going down these stairs, which were flooding, but we found our way down. We were going down the street. More waves were coming our way. Someone hosted some party which was all painted and fancy, but there were stingy rooms. An old guy complained and I explained about the waves. Apparently aliens were stealing our water.",Negative
"I was on the farm and a civil war or feud was taking place. A man named O'Neill, tall and thin with black hair, said he had a treasure at bottom of muddy swampy lake in our horse and mule place below our barn. ""I'll kill anyone who comes close."" He dives in and comes up; assumption is that it's there, perhaps in a chest. I go around to come in at back, some bullets still flying around me. I get to back side of large pen behind the barn and climb a hill-cliff to be above him. At top I'm not at our farm; I'm in suburbia like house, oak trees and edges of lawns. I throw rocks at sea creatures or rocks of same shape, like stinging rays and squid; one shaped like this seems to move from my rock or alive... Dogs come out and I throw at them; my brother comes out and I almost hit him. Dream stops.",Negative
"I dreamt that I was in church along with many others. We were listening to a sermon by our pastor who had just died a week ago. The choir sang a beautiful hymn, and we all applauded loudly. There was a great deal of levity and laughter, but no one seemed to remark about this case of extreme bad taste. The pastor left the pulpit and we all sat still and very quiet as if we were waiting for something else to happen.",Positive
"I was at the SAID conference. I had spent the night with Ben D. We were getting ready for the day, the first day of conference. He had a presentation that he was getting his materials together for. Either we went to Macy F's room or she came to ours for some reason. We were chatting. We left to go to one of the main conference areas. We walked into the area where the exhibitors and products were to be set up. The room was full of many exhibitors, and only other exhibitors than what I had scheduled. I was dumbfounded, and angry. I stopped and spoke briefly with one of the exhibitors. I asked if they had rented a booth here and they said no, they were just paying a percent of sales. I asked what percentage they were paying and they said it depended on the item. Then I asked them whom they spoke to about being here and they said Loretta M. I immediately became furious. I began moving around the room and speaking with other exhibitors. They had all spoken to Loretta M, and they were all pay percentages of sales as opposed to booth rental. The amounts they were paying all varied. Ron L and a business partner had one of the booths. He had some type of expensive equipment they were showing and selling. He was being charged 45% commission. I approached Loretta M. I was so angry I could hardly speak, but trying to tell her that this was not her place to do this, and especially to do it without my knowledge.",Negative
"I woke up and I wasn't sure if I was dreaming. I got out of bed and went downstairs to the bathroom, I think, and then looked out the kitchen door. It was dark outside, and I was pondering whether I should leave the house and take the risk that I might be awake. I decided not to go out. I went to the den, and looked at something with writing on it. As a test, I closed my eyes and opened them again, and this time it read slightly differently. This still didn't make me lucid, however, and I wasn't positive I was dreaming until my dream faded. I'm driving a truck down my driveway. I realize the brakes aren't working, and I try to use the horn to tell everybody on the street to get out of the way. I think I almost hit a couple cars, but I don't. I drive up the street, putting my foot to the pedal as hard as I can, and I get the thing moving very fast for fun. The ride sort of felt more like a motorcycle than a truck.",Negative
"Donating Sperm  I'm donating sperm. I'm standing at the counter where a woman is getting my file. My sister Ramona is at the counter. I feel embarrassed with Ramona there. The woman looks at my file, which is a pink folder, and says my sperm were 90% dead. I say that I know that. I'm uncomfortable and embarrassed. She gives me the things I need to donate: the cup is shorter and wider than the one I had before. I think it will be easier to aim into. She points me to a room across the hallway. I go out into the large, wide hallway. There are many doors. I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to go into. I walk down the hallway, looking into rooms. One room is large and empty: classroom-like, and has religious artifacts around it. I wonder if it's a good idea to ejaculate in that room. I'm near the end of the hallway. I see my friend Simon Naver walk by, around the corner. He sees me and after pausing, he comes over and we talk a little bit. We shake hands: I don't get a good grip. I ask him how much money he made this summer, because I hear he made a lot. He says he made $9,000! We talk, but are uncomfortable doing so. Our high school teammate Tony Kramer may be there. I leave, and walk back down the hall to the office area. There are several famous movie stars in a room: a man and a couple women. A woman was raped earlier, though she didn't realize it. As a result it hurt have to have sex when the group was donating sperm.",Negative
"I dreamt I was going to the university. When I got there some students were starting to riot due to a fraud that had been committed. The university was the Museum of Art, and the students were assembled in a round park in front of the Museum. Suddenly they started to throw stones and the guards who were policing intervened. They started to shoot and then I started to run. I ran and ran through a street with no pavement and suddenly I was in a big avenue where I found my grandfather who asked me where I was going in such a hurry and what was happening. When I dream about streets and avenues, they are sunny, including the park and the art museum In the dream are in a combination of yellow and beige tones, a sunny kind of day.",Negative
"I was coming back on a plane with Ezra. As we were landing we were going towards stuff that was on the runway and the pilot turned and we spun around and went into the water. We got out easily. I went to the toilet and I wrote this letter and donated this book etc and then put it in the bin. I changed my mind and took them back. I went through a scanner thing and it beeped so I emptied all my stuff. This lady said ""I miss Michael (she was reading from my letter)... Have you got a boyfriend?"" and I said ""No"". There was a wig with my stuff and I said ""oh, that's not mine"". Mom was there too. Also, she would send Rover on flights all the time because he liked them.",Positive
"I dreamed that it was morning and that I was to wake up the other men sleeping on the second floor of my fraternity house. I picked up a dry mop (my roommate is a part-time brush salesman and frequently has such in the room). Grasping it by the mop end, I proceeded to go around waking up all the sleepers in the house. This I did by poking them in the chest with the handle of the mop. The last I came to was my roommate (roommates since last September -- his age 24). Instead of the chest I poked him in the genital area and was surprised to find that the handle penetrated into his body to a depth of several inches. I wiggled the mop handle around to waken him, at which time there appeared several other men who seemed to be quite astonished. The last thing I remember was asking him how in the world it had been possible to make the insertion without injuring him. I can't remember what his answer was.",Negative
"I am aboard a ship. The admiral is a disgusting, somewhat filthy old man who approaches me and I show him my teeth, partial dentures. Someone puts the teeth in the admiral's mouth and I say, ""You have to have places empty between certain teeth so the plates will fit."" But the teeth strangely enough fit his mouth and he looks a lot better. Later, still on the ship, I see him dressed as a woman. I am completely amazed, since I know it is the admiral, yet now he is thinner and beautiful. His wrists, I note, are thin and clean and his hair is quite stylish. In fact, he is the center of attraction among the passengers. I can't believe it is the same person.",Negative
"We had a new apartment. It's an open sort of garden apartment, and right next door to a brick office building like the Judge Baker and Children Association in Boston. I'm standing at the window looking across into an office, and there's Evans _________, and I remark to myself that he must have two jobs. He catches my eye as I'm looking over at him, waves and then comes over to the apartment with a group of people, and we have a big party up on the roof. Audrey comes home. Then there are just the two of us there together, and there's something about my mixing a drink. Then the doorbell rings. She goes downstairs, comes back and says that there's somebody selling the Saturday Evening Post, and I should go down and tell him that we don't want any. I say why the hell don't you tell him, and she says she's too embarrassed. I had the image of the salesman being a young boy, but as I was going downstairs, I saw thru the bottom of the door, and it was the front porch of the house that I grew up in on Summerset Street in New Brunswick. I saw under the door this foot and it was a club foot which explained why Audrey was too embarrassed. She probably would have wanted to buy the magazine out of sympathy, but then she would have had a hard time explaining to me why she got the Saturday Evening Post. Anyway I opened the door and feeling a little sheepish myself, I said that we didn't want the Saturday Evening Post and closed the door. The scene shifts and I'm in a large city that's old Boston which is being changed into New Boston. The most distinctive part is a very old and elaborately decorated, with lots of facades, church. It reminds me of the church alongside of the harbor in Lisbon as you come in, and Calvin and I were talking about Portugal last night and how death-like it is. There was a similar quality about this old Boston. It seems like it was late at night and there were no people around. There wouldn't have been many people around even if it was daytime because the whole place was in a state of disarray. I was in a taxicab, and he driver was pointing out all the different buildings that were going to be torn down and rebuilt. Then all of a sudden he started up this unbelievably steep bridge, so steep that as I was sitting there in the car in the back seat, I could feel kinesthetically that if a little breeze came along, the car might tip over backwards. It was going up almost perpendicularly. I was frightened, but didn't say anything, figuring the taxi driver knew what he was doing. He probably took this route many times. Still I wondered how he stood it. Then I remembered having taken the same bridge myself when I was driving back from Cape Cod one time. It was late and I was in a hurry to get home, and so I overcame my fear of the bridge that time and went over it, but I was so frightened that I wouldn't do it again because the saving of time wasn't worth the fright that I had to go through. This reminds me incidentally of the same kind of experience down in Yucatan and ___________. I was going to climb the __________ stairs and got up 10 or 15 steps and decided that while I wouldn't have any trouble getting up, when it came to coming down I would probably feel very frightened and decided it wasn't worth going thru all that. Then somehow or another I'm not in the cab any longer, but I'm walking on this bridge. It's dark out and I have to watch very carefully where I walk. There seems to be holes around. It's a rather rickety old bridge, part of Old Boston. There's a vague feeling that there are other people around and possibly getting ready to put on a stage production of some kind. They are rehearsing. I think there are posters, the kind you see along the New Haven railroad through Connecticut advertising the Broadway plays. Then the scene shifts again, and I'm in a kind of hospital or university setting. The point is that I am studying for a second degree, another Ph.D. This one in physiology. I'm thinking whether this means that I will have an MD or whether it will be a Ph.D. in physiology, and I decide that it will be the latter. There's something about a girl in this. A large-boned blond like the blond in the picture From Russia with Love. Very good-looking girl, and I think she's nude and somehow or another I'm focused mainly on her abdomen and belly button. There's something about a diamond shape. Diamond shape like a large square of light that's flashed on her abdomen. No particular erotic feelings, although I don't quite understand why not. Then I see the same girl and she has clothes on. She's sitting at a table as though in a cafeteria talking to this other guy, a clerk or something, who works in the hospital or university and she's very openly and candidly telling him about her latest boyfriend and different difficulties that she's having with him. I'm feeling quite envious or inadequate that she's so easy going with this guy and not with me. As I woke up, I was thinking about the impression that these two degrees would make on people. On the one hand, having two Ph.D.'s doesn't show because you only put it down once. On the other hand, it would be very impressive to the few people who would find out about it, that I got a second Ph.D. in physiology, and passed up an MD because the training for both is so close together, this would look like a very scholarly move. There was kind of a conflict going on. On the one hand, getting the Ph.D. in physiology would have been genuine on my part as would passing up the MD, but I seem to be looking around for some little grain of, some little bone to throw to narcissism in there trying to get credit for something.",Negative
"I was on the side of a road. I'd made a bet or something that I could hitchhike. I was wearing skimpy clothes to help get picked up. Rebekah was there and she was a hitchhiker/prostitute. I said ""she may be expensive, but I'm [something I don't remember]"" and we laughed but she said ""you know what I do every night?!"" and she did some stupid thing because her mother had died or something. Then I was walking down another road. It was a long straight road, and I walked past a road to the left (like a T-junction) and a cop was parked on the side of the road. The road was now sandy and bumpy and this person was driving waiting to be out of sight of the police before picking me up. The cop came and ended up crashing. Then it was Freaks and Geeks and this had been a test. It showed one of the main female characters having sex with someone and then all the secondary characters were masturbating each other. I was like ""ok..."". Then Mom took me home. It was late, I think. Darren was in the car. I had to transfer some stuff I had downloaded. When I came back to Mom's, they were on porn sites. I was then watching Lost, but Laguerta (Dexter) was on it and she couldn't remember anything she did after getting in her car the night before. Then Ben and Juliet (both from Lost) were talking. I thought they were going to kiss and I was thinking 'ew, Ben's too cool for her'. Then Juliet was with some other guy. Laguerta remembered had seen the dude and had either had an affair with him, or had found out about one.",Positive
"There were several episodes with my wife Bonita and my daughter Christina and me going around various places.  I remember, for instance, sliding down a big hill towards a swimming pool or something.  No snow-just a hill covered with dry grass.  The only other thing I remember is Dede Schaffer giving me the news that Bonita had had another baby, and it was a girl.  I saw it, and it looked just like Christina.  I couldn't hold back the tears and started to cry, because we had had all the children we planned to have and didn't have a boy.",Positive
Last night before I went to sleep I was watching a TV program about the final episode of Friends. This dream was kind of an extension of that special where they were continuing to interview the actors and writers from the program. In particular they were talking about how some or all of the actors may reunite on the spin-off program. One thing in particular that I remember is that they should all reunite at Thanksgiving because on the program the six of them always spent the holiday together.,Positive

I am holding a carton of cigs, the carton is bright red and the cigs are not Salems, so I keep looking. I see a display case with ""novelty"" cigs; they are Salems. One jar is full of fat candy cigarettes with chocolate tips. Another has cigars, fat, with a ""fringe"" on it. I decide to take the candy cigs because the regular ones can't be found and they are better than nothing. Then Ginny brings me some of hers, the real kind.",Positive
"I was taking a music theory course with Mr. Hanover and that it was the first day and he wanted us to, I thought that it was kind of near the end of the period and so I got up and I was starting to follow Melinda out the door and he's like, ""Hey, where are you going?"" And so we sat back down. He put this like practice thing up on the overhead, he gave us each a little notebook about the size of a, about four times the size of a matchbook, and it had little tiny shapes of staff paper in it. It was kind of like a measure note pad, and we were supposed to, except these little pieces of staff paper were like dated and titled and stuff, and we were supposed to keep our little practice things in it. And he was going to collect them, like writing a sharp on this line and putting this something-or-other on that space, and what does this mean, what does that mean and stuff like that. I don't remember too much about what it was. And I dreamt that instead of doing the practice, I was writing a story in this thing about someone being a very kind and gentle musician and nobody realizing it. And then I woke up. That was kind of dumb, huh?",Negative
"I was at school at the library, because I had Biology. Eugene was there on a computer. Calvin and Genevieve came later and sat next to Eugene.

During Accounting, we had to go get our photos for the yearbook taken. The Year 12's had to go to the library. Farrah was there, saying hello. Evelyn came. It was Lillian's turn and she was talking.

Ezra came in and sat next to me (we were at a desk). He knew my password for DreamBank and I was on it later trying to find out how to change the password. It looked different and had a forum. I couldn't find anything about changing your password. I was then in a lady's home and I had to leave (I was with others and we were on a mission thing). I had to drag this heavy carpet out.

"Drowned Black Cat  I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson in the Big Resort Area. We canoe along. We're dragging a yellow minnow bucket. A black cat is right next to the minnow bucket. The cat drowns. We are swimming in the water, dragging the cat and the bucket. It seems we're on Little 15 Mile Lake, and we get lost again. He finds our orientation, and we head southeast, to make a loop in the time we have. We're using his Grumman canoe. There are two yellow canoes ahead of us that make it to the portage before us. We go past the Jordan portage to the Lora portage. It's 90 rods long. The water we cross is turbulent. I carry the canoe on the portage. The yoke is very close to the back of the canoe and my view is obstructed by the back seat. I say to Kevin that we forgot the bent-shaft paddles! A man at the portage tries to drag two aluminum canoes by putting the bows of each on each of his shoulders and driving his legs. I pass this man, running carrying our canoe, which is really light. We come to an open area. I am leading with the canoe. Kevin follows, with a younger kid and a man in his party. They want to take a photograph of me because I handle the Grumman like it's a feather, even running with it. I stop for them to take a photograph. The front of the canoe bends like I am carrying a carpet. The open space we've come to is a motor home park. There is a blacktop road, and open camping area, and some store areas. We walk in towards this tourist area. I see many northern pike that swim along the side of the road, where there is a four or five foot wall that drops down to the water level. I think we may be able to get some paddles here. Kevin asks about the amount of propane we have: he thinks we may not have enough. There are big ice cream cones in the tourist area.",Negative

And I showed it to them and they said it wasn't the thing that she said, and the main said, ""Well, just go on in."" So I went in and I was walking around. I think I was by myself. I don't remember too much about what I saw around the place, but I do remember one of the features was a carousel and there weren't many people getting on it. And because there weren't many people getting on it, it wasn't really _______.

The man next to me, leaning against the counter, wears a nautical cap (with a bill) and asks me if I expect to see the boat races that afternoon. He describes the boats that have been entered to represent Washington, D.C., including a large of powerful one of 300 horse power. I answer that boat riding is detestable to me, and I believe one must be brought up on water to enjoy boating. Therefore one of our party points out some striking exceptions to such a theory. Oman and I each order a cup of coffee, and I get a piece of toast also. The waiter carries the coffee pot over to my seat and fills my cup first. After consuming the toast I am still hungry, and look around trying to discover what other food is available. Up to this time I have impression that the meals are free, though I notice the waiter marking ""5 cents"" after one of the items on the menu, indicating that one of our party owes 5 c. for this. Presently I order something like an omelet, which must be cooked on a sort of electric grill which already has a piece of toast on its top. However, the cook partly lifts the toast and slips the omelet into an interior compartment.",Negative

"My dream happened in the H. tunnel. I was with another person, a woman; it seems to me it was my mother, but I am not sure. We had to go through the tunnel, but it was closed on both sides by portals. Then we opened one of them and we started to walk and then to run because the bats' screams terrified me. I placed two objects, like books or notebooks, over my ears in order not to hear. I was afraid that they would bite me, especially my legs. At last we got to the other gate, and the person who was with me started to go out walking on her knees. I walked with my feet because the idea of kneeling on that floor was revolting to me. At that point I woke up.",Negative
"In the dream it was the very last day of the semester of school, and for some reason my girlfriend and I had to buy her father perhaps a watchband, but it had something to do with glasses. Some accessory to glasses, I mean some accessory to drinking glasses. Something like a watchband is to a watch, this was to glasses, that he really needed. We wanted to buy it because the next day would be the last day of school. So we went to a little shop I remember. There was a little Jewish woman proprietor and she said that the next day they wouldn't be open until 12 o'clock, what does she have to kill herself for, and so on and so forth. So we looked at the stock that they had and I didn't like it too much. So I said to my girlfriend, ""Let's go. ""We'll look at another place before making a decision.""",Positive
"Henry Min lent me a canoe and sent me on a trip down a river that wound through a canyon-indoors.  It was like a business that he ran.  It was fun as far as it went, but it didn't go very far.

"I was working in a store, but in the open.  It was a pretty dirty place.  Behind me was something representing a cow.  It wasn't the whole body-only the front, perhaps.  Attached to it were four or five bloody hands, resembling dogs' paws.  I could hardly stand to be there.  Someone told me that if anyone had handled a paw originally (there had been only 2 originally), they might get the disease too, whatever it was.  I was horrified, because I remembered examining them earlier.  I wanted very badly to get away.",Negative
"I was at home where a girl and I were sitting on my couch watching a movie. Then this huge snake came through my door and I grabbed my girl friend and we ran into my room and I opened my closet and I saw all these guns.

So I ran up to the snake and blew its head off, and then I woke up.",Negative

"Audrey is having some people in and they're socializing around the place. I'm going from room to room looking for a place where I can work. Then I'm working on an open table on Eastern Avenue in New Brunswick. People are coming and going. There's very loud music coming out of this one house and I assume that it's a place that I own. Then I got to this spot where I sense that the house is that I own, and there's just an empty space there. I'm very puzzled for a moment. Then I locate the music again and it's coming out of another house, and the other house belongs to somebody else, so I can't do anything about it. I see a couple of women walking around in there and they seem to be having a party. I get back at the table and start work again. Then David comes along in his little red car. I don't remember David's last name, but it's the David that lives up at Ijourie's place. He's parked and he's outside looking very closely at the paint job on his car. As I pass him on the way back to the table, I say, ""Hi there, David O,"" and he doesn't say anything. I figure, well, he hasn't heard me, but I just let it go at that thinking I'll get back to work. Then it turns out that David and this friend of his are out to give a prize to somebody for some art work, and I say half jokingly and half seriously that any time he wants to look over my work, he can, with the idea that he might give it the prize. He says no, they're not doing that right now. They really came here to have a picnic, and he opens this bottle of pickles and starts spreading meat out, soda pop and bread all over this table. So I go back to the apartment and now it seems it's getting renovated and there are lots of repairmen around. There's another section to this dream. A female Ph.D. is like an usher and is saying to me as I come into this building, ""Don't forget your Ph.D. card."" I guess I had lunch and then there's some business about the check and how much of a tip to leave this waitress. I give her $4 and she gives me back 1 peso and 50 centavos. I'm thinking in terms of 50 centavos will be enough of a tip. Then this woman pulls her dress down and she's naked, standing there naked. Then I recognize that it's Shirley MacLaine. She has a strand of red hair sort of greased and twisted around one of her breasts.",Positive
"I was sitting up in a tree with Dora, trying to figure out what my name was. We were thinking and thinking and we couldn't come up with anything. Dora said if we left soon we could see the monkeys pick bananas while they were still little. An elephant was bamming against the tree trunk. This steady rhythm was putting me to sleep. Dora said, ""My mother says at least when the mean boys are down there doing gang whistles and throwing sticks we know we're not alone."" If we were dying and we were alone nobody would know and it would be sadder. I was folding up a piece of paper and sticking it under my leotard. There were no drugs in it but I knew the way to fold it. It was about time to go to college. It was a long drive and we were running out of money. Dora said a couple of girls were looking ethereal, like angels, they thought because they'd lost too much weight and they couldn't think straight. First we had to drop off other people. I was last. I needed socks. When someone gave me $20 back I had $21.44 but the bill at the shoe store was $76.44 and I couldn't figure out why. I didn't even need any shoes. I needed socks. It was a shoe store. ??? had been given a choice in ???. The red plastic brown trash bag was filling and the chimney at all crazy angles like it'd been in a bad storm at sea. They asked Michael what he had to say about the house they'd given him and he said it doesn't believed it would be in the neighborhood. I also picked out 8 hairclips I didn't even like. They had stupid butterflies of them. They ran the bill up too high. I wanted some knee socks. Knee socks. I wanted white or black but they only had tan.",Negative

"I am on a camping trip. We are gathering some firewood, bringing it back to camp. I seem to be part of a Boy Scout troop. I wander off a side path that leads toward a redwood, and this completely changes the dream. I am beside a bay of the sea. The bay has partially flooded this slum area of the city. As I watch, a large, brown whale swims in right beside the old, deserted slum houses. Then I float around this bay on an air mattress. The water gets rough at several places, and I almost fall off the mattress. I worry about being swept too far out to sea, or out to where the whales are, but it doesn't happen. The slum buildings are no longer deserted, but are lived in by slum dwellers, who are controlled to a great extent by a crooked politician-gangster. I seem to be a doctor, now, who is also doing a little surreptitious investigation of the whole setup. I, and a companion I don't remember, were looking around the area, but trying to be inconspicuous. Somehow we are arrested and jailed in this old building where I perform some sort of medical duties on a sick man. I get out somehow, but almost get lost getting out of the building, for it has many doors and it is confusing. Now the crooked politician has one of his strong-arm boys watching me, as well as eavesdropping occasionally himself. I am talking to a secretary (who seems to be Arlene Morgel) who works there in the area, perhaps for him. I pretend to be a reporter, just collecting human interest material on the boss. I ask about how he perhaps came up from a poor, slum background to be a successful leader, etc., etc., to impress the boss who may be listening. I think the secretary knows I am faking all this too. The boss's name is Mr. Bowpas, or Baupas. I woke up at this point and made some notes. Then fell back to sleep and dreamed a completion. The secret, illegal way in which Mr. Bowpas was making his money was by manufacturing and selling ice cream (strawberry) in a factory that was hidden under the water of the bay. I pictured a big cask under the bay when I thought of the factory. The dream now takes a more international turn, as if this were a small country instead of just a slum ward, and I dream that the new prime minister is revealing this illegal activity and not letting it go on, although he could have taken it over for himself, as many politicians in the past had done.",Negative
"I was walking along with the traffic and a policeman was also with me. I took off a part of a job finished and he would inspect it. I took off about four pieces of finished product and he inspected them. Then he said, ""Let the traffic roll on or we will bottle it up."" I looked at it as it rolled on in two lanes and the road was muddy. We looked at an old mansion. I noticed one of the small decorative small steeples was missing part of the top. Then a city official stopped on the road by the mansion. He knelt on the ground and said a prayer for the official who lived in the mansion. I thought that was a very wonderful thing for a man to do.",Positive

"I went to the CAS office to retrieve something I had left there. Bill C needed to leave so I told him I would let myself out. He didn't seem to be okay with that. I became very angry and lashed out at him about not trusting me and how I don't deserve that mistrust and never have. He didn't say much, though I could tell he wasn't totally convinced. He did, however, finally decide to leave and allow me to let myself out when I was finished. It looks like I'm someplace other than the CAS office and there are quite a few people around. They seem to be getting ready for a costume party. Brian F is there and I see him walk into the men's room wearing nothing but a Tarzan type g-string. I told him if he was going to wear that I would not have anything to do with him. He assured me he wasn't going to. Later it seems that it was someone else wearing that costume. I'm now standing by a soft drink vending machine. For some reason I decide the money needs to be emptied out and deposited. I take it out and put it in a bank bag. I was going to put a note on it and put it in Jennifer C's desk drawer. Then I realized that she and Bill C both might get upset with me for doing her job. I didn't know what to do then.

I hurried the same way I hurried when I finished a final in this room at the end of last quarter. I was so relieved in the dream that I didn't go back to get the purse.

I see some shelves high on a wall but as I look more closely, they are thin old wood boards that won't hold much. I need more space.

I am impressed. It looks like I have more space. There are two dining tables. One rectangular and normal. The other round and black. But the top of it breaks off. Now that needs to be fixed. I see a curtain like a hospital room curtain. I look behind to see what mess might be stashed back there. Not bad. Pretty clean.

We continue arguing and I am not afraid that he is a police officer, and I tell him to basically fuck off. The cop leaves after we argue some more and then he leaves. After he leaves, Allen, the girl and myself decide to build a fort out of the couches like I used to when I was a little kid. I feel pretty good about the whole situation because I did not let the cop tell me what to do.",Negative
"The remembrance I have of the progress of this dream, I was standing in front of a desk. On the desk was seated one of the girls in our dorm who is a year ahead of me. I seemed to be being interviewed and then I realized that I was trying out for radio club. Next I was aware of one of the fellows who is in radio club. I don't know him very well, but I do know that he is in his 20's. He was looking me up and down, considering my fitness for the club. The girl at the desk said I think she will be okay, don't you? He replied shortly no, her legs and ankles are too fat. The case seemed to be closed and no one argued his decision. That is all I remember before I woke up.",Positive
"Ezra and I were in the water. The only way to get out was to get over this platform, under which an octopus/squid lived under. We kept trying to get on the platform, but the squid thing kept coming out. It grabbed me and pulled me under and I couldn't breathe. I got up onto the platform and the squid thing bit me on the right side of my hip. I jumped up and got fully out of the water. [When I woke up, it hurt where it had bit me].",Negative
Releasing Fish  I am fishing. I have caught five or six small northern pike. I try to release them. Some of them can't be revived. I know they will die and float on the surface of the water. I think this is okay because birds or turtles will eat them: they won't be wasted.,Negative

"I am the only guy in a room full of pregnant young women. It seems like all of the women are either teenagers or in their early twenties. They are also all attractive girls. I am talking to this one girl and she asks me if I wan to se her stomach. She seems like she is only about five or six months pregnant because she is not really huge, but it is obvious that she is pregnant. I tell her that I am a child development specialist and that I would like to see her stomach. She is wearing a dress and without hesitation she lifts the dress above her waist. She is not wearing any underwear and she is naked except for the dress covering her breasts and shoulders. I look at her stomach, but I am more surprised that she is not wearing underwear and that she does not seem embarrassed at all. Basically I am turned on by the whole experience, but I kind of feel bad because she is pregnant and I feel like I is disrespectful to lust after pregnant women.",Negative
"In this dream I was working in an office somewhere, but I felt I didn't work there permanently, but just temporarily replacing someone. I was working with just an undershirt and slacks on. They had a small stairway in this office that would take your to offices overlooking offices on the first floor. I remember frequently running up these stairs to do something and upon descending I noticed a piece of buttered bread that was lying on someone's desk and it made me very hungry. When walking to my office even, I noticed pieces of buttered bread all around and there was even one on my desk. I ate it but was still hungry. When leaving to go upstairs again, I went over to a few desks with the break and broke off a piece and ate it as I figured they wouldn't miss it.",Negative
"Something was going on in the mobile home park across the street.  There was a man who looked like Jack, an Indian man I chat with online.  He had a gun, and whatever he was up to, his intentions were trouble.  My parents and brother Stuart and I ran to see what was going on.  In running we encountered a woman with a gun, and we told her not to let the man take it.  In a cluttered room, the man takes her in a struggle.  My family and I stood off to the side, helpless.  My dad had a large knife, and he was scared.  The fear cracked him.  He made only one motion of the knife in their direction.  Before I knew what happened, he took the knife to my left forearm.  He struck my mother and I struggled as he turned back toward me.  He was stronger, and sliced me again.  He was trying to kill us so we wouldn't die at the hands of the other man.  When I awoke I felt the pains of the cut on my arm.",Negative
"My father, my brother X. and I are standing in a line at a bank. My turn comes and I step up to the cashier's window to cash a check. After receiving my money, the teller asks, ""Do you want the free coffee with that?"" Suprised by this offer, I accept and am handed a coupon. I think to myself, ""I wonder what 'coffee' means."" I'm then taken (alone) to a big ballroom or dining hall in the back. At the door I'm handed a cup of coffee and a plate of pastries. I walk up to some round tables in the middle of the room and see that there is bread on the tables and that many people are sitting and eating. ""Oh, it's a whole Continental breakfast,"" I say. I look for a place to sit, but the occupied tables are all full. Before sitting down I realize, ""The bank is in a hotel."" I go back to the cashier window, which is now an ornate desk in the hotel lobby, and see that my father has just gotten some money and is walking away with X. He sees me and says, ""Oy, I didn't get a breakfast."" From his tone of voice it is clear that he regrets forgetting to ask for his free breakfast.",Positive
"The setting of this dream was a zoo. I didn't recognize it as any particular zoo. There was a young woman, a teacher, I believe, who was making a big ruckus about removing the ducks. The officials who were all men were taking the ducks away, for some reason that I can't remember now. The teacher was objecting to this. There were children playing with the ducks. I was an onlooker.",Negative
We were in a cave or out in a dark field. I heard lions roaring. I think they were in a cage. Bob was a small boy. He had a skirt on and I was trying to pin it on his shirt so he would have cover for his sex organs. I was trying to hang something up by driving nails into good varnished wood. Seemed like a dresser or some kind of molding. I saw iii in the entries for the weight.,Negative

"I was doing a play, and we did lots of improv work. I think it was a school play, though it seemed like an acting camp I went to over the summer. Then we were doing the play, and the music was all off, so we had to improvise in front of the audience. Then I was really made at Olive (who happens to be my worst enemy), so I called her a bitch and then I woke up. Setting: In a theater, and backstage. Characters: summer camp actors; Olive, my worst enemy. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. Olive was being really bitchy yesterday, so I know where that came from.",Positive
"In this dream the figure of the place of central hall, I had had a debate with myself earlier in the dream as to whether or not her hair would be parted in the middle and combed down on the side of her head so that it was long and sure enough later in the dream, there's a very clear image, crystal clear image, of her with her in this style. Her hair is blond, bleached, I believe, and she looks exactly as she does in all her pictures. The feeling upon seeing her as I had predicted was one of slight disappointment and she somehow appeared vitalized because of it. The female that I'm describing is the contemporary jazz singer, Peggy Lee. There were activities that led up this image, but I don't recall them. As I saw her. It appeared to be something akin to an interview in which there was visible a picture of her from about the middle of the bodice up, and she was engaged in conversation with possibly some interviewer. She was smiling warmly and even radiatingly as is often seen in her pictures on record albums and other places.",Positive
"I was with Ezra and someone. There was music playing and A Glass of Champagne came on but it was slow. I sang along and at the nickelodeon-y bit, I 'sang' it.

I was telling Mom that it should've done well.",Positive
"There were a lot of people. There are a lot of people in my dreams. In this case we were sitting at this very very very large table, something vast like 20 feet in diameter or bigger. All these people were sitting around this big round table. I knew that it was round because it was rough around the edges like the bottoms of our chairs, the new chairs that we got and it was very thick and it was like the people were...there was no arguing, there was no...they were just sitting there not really doing anything, nothing ever came to pass. There seemed to be no purpose for the people sitting there and yet I can remember the vastness of the table. I almost think that they weren't sitting as much as they were just...suspended at the table. It felt like we were sitting, but the more I think about it the more I think that the chairs were almost suspended, they were kind of floating. My weight didn't feel like it was pressing on the chair but the people were just kind of talking, but there was nothing resolved or purpose to be there.",Positive
"I was at school and we were hanging in a classroom. Calvin left and I went to look for him. I found him and he said something about ""Logan"".

I got the wrong bit of paper. I ran back. Somehow inside, Harlan had sticky tape. He and his friends tied me up on this bed. I got out of it and I went back to the gym.

Jeremiah was next to me and a yellow hat was in the way. Mom worked at McDonald's. There was a really cheesy burger. The shop was set up strangely and it was hard to wash up. There was weird soap.

Roland was wearing a black shirt that said 'Rainbow' in red and I realized it was the band. The bus came and it was the 451 and I then realized we needed to take a train.

"We were back in my parents' house: me, Laura, and one of her friends. We were hanging out in my old room; we had brought some stuff in and were preparing to clean it and some other things out. One of these things was a black backpack with a book on 'Black Magic' in it. Inside this book -- rather, on top of it, between the covers -- was a huge mass of yellowish-brown chunky material. I knew this to be 'human remains', and it was somehow associated with the Ku Klux Klan and racist politicians. It was something I had found in the house.  We all had to take showers before we left because we were all dirty. Laura took hers, and I took mine. I came back into my old room, naked, and saw that Laura's friend was about to touch the 'human remains'. I told her not to do that, and let me tell her the story. And by the way, the shower was free. So I lead her over to my parents' shower and I begin to tell her the story about the human remains, but then I notice that my parents have come back home and are in their bed (which is right by the door to their bedroom). In fact, my mother has sat up and is glaring at me. I realize I'm naked, and immediately I jump into the bathroom and begin looking for a towel to wrap around myself, but they're all too small. After finding two smaller towels, I discover a big one that will wrap around me. I exit the bathroom thus covered, and find that my parents -- rather, my mother -- is about the house causing a ruckus, moaning and crying because Laura and I call elsewhere ""home"". ""Let's go home,"" I say to Laura. She says: ""Wait. I have to train these vines first.""  In my old room there is a huge box with these foot long, caterpillar-like things in them. These are the vines. Laura has twisted each one with another, sometimes a smaller one, sometimes not. These are writhing and turning like animals, and swimming around on the surface of the box like bacteria under a microscope. They are bulging out at the ends.  ""Look,"" I say. ""They're trying to sprout. Shouldn't you put them in water?""  ""Naah,"" says Laura. ""They'll live.""  ""We should pack up the rest of this stuff,"" I said.  ""Why is there so much, anyway?""  ""Remember?"" I say. ""We thought they'd be coming back tomorrow. We had an extra day.""  I start going through the box in the closet. I dispose of the 'human remains' out the window, take the perfectly clean book entitled ""Black Magic"", I take a few other books, and leave in the closet a few adolescent romance novels. None of the stuff in the box was mine.",Negative
A man and I are looking for something or someone. At first we are outdoors. Then we move inside what appears to be a large garage. We observe what I think is the biggest frog I have ever seen.

"I went to this Chinese restaurant with a friend and we both already had some Chinese food with us. We walked in and this old Chinese guy, presumably the owner, reached his hand into my friend's one and started feeling all the food. He went to reach into mine and I said no. He showed me he was wearing clean gloves and I reluctantly agreed. After feeling around he said it was ok. Then some people were sneaking around out the back looking for something. They were good and the Chinese owners were bad. This black guy and his white girlfriend were in this bedroom looking for something. They heard the people coming so quickly got undressed and pretended to be having sex (she was bent over and he was behind her). His penis was huge; unnaturally long. The old Asian owner came in and saw them. The black guy was like 'sorry we just couldn't help ourselves' and the Asian guy just kept staring at them and then encouraged them to continue. The black guy hesitantly started having anal sex with her, only putting in a little bit and then after a few seconds she said she had come (she was obviously in pain and just saying that to make it stop). But the Asian guy wanted more so he put his penis around the side of her face and she somehow put it in her mouth backwards (so the head was pointing out) and started pushing her head back and forth.

"I dreamed a cat irritated me, so I decided to put it outside, even though the winter was cold. As I took it by the neck and opened the door, the cat turned and bit me on the finger and sunk all its claws into my hand. I put the cat on the floor and killed it with a ball-pen hammer. I looked down and there was blood on my rubber boots that I was tracking over the linoleum, which I quickly wiped up with paper towels, thinking of what lie I would tell the children if they walked in. I put cat in white wax paper sack and ground was frozen, so I found soft, dry dirt and I dug a ""cathole"" with my bare hands under the edge of a raised garage. The next day, that garage was torn down and a new one of cement blocks was in its place. On the wall 5 feet above ground was my briefcase and in it was the white sack with white cat inside. Children and I were out walking and looking at fall leaves, and as they looked at bright leaves, I dropped it in a post office box. As it hit the bottom with a thud, I wondered if the sack may have had my address on it, and worried about another return.",Negative
"I was a graduate student named Kessen or something like that. I had figured up a sign of some sort of a study, which showed how much experimenters influenced their subjects to produce the type of data they wanted or something like that. And I was going to have Gardner Murphy as our experimenter. But somehow it was as if nobody was supposed to do an experiment like this. I kept finding myself forgetting what the experiment was about and thinking I was going to do some other type of experiment. Finally I got to talk to the psychologist Gardner Murphy about this and explain the real experiment. Then I pointed out to him some sort of how we had both forgotten what the real experiment was about, to show how important it was to get this experiment done. It was a real strain all through this dream - which was much longer than I am able to recall - to keep the real experiment in mind and not get sidetracked on some sort of innocuous substitute.",Negative
"I only remember this dream vaguely: I was cleaning my house, dusting the furniture in the living room because we were going to have guests that evening. Everyone at home was busy. I did not know who was going to come to the house. After dusting, I saw myself wiping the floor. It was daytime. I don't remember if I spoke to anyone. I saw everyone at home who lives there. Afterwards, the dream becomes fuzzy, but at a later moment I saw that the guests were all of us who lived there. A group of friends of ours had invited us to a very nice restaurant that I know. They were giving a dinner party in our honor. People were greeting us and I got to see a table decorated very nicely with delicious food. I did not look at the locale too much, but it was big and elegant. It was nighttime. That is all I remember. Note: I also remember that I thought, when I was at the restaurant, that we were the ones offering the dinner party, but when I realized that it was being offered for us, I did not mind it at all. I did not place any weight on that fact. I was happy.",Positive
I was at home and something happened to my room. My bed was at my window. Dad said that nineteen things had disappeared so if I saw anything weird I should tell him.

"The area to the west side of the house was much bigger, and Dad had made like a little petting zoo. And there was this one thing with this stone wall and this railing like they have at Jungle Park, and there was a little pond with about three or four mallard ducks in it. And there was one duck that somehow got outside the little area, that they had like an island of sand and then a little pond for them like they do at Jungle Park for the flamingos. Well, I took some bird seed out of a can and I had climbed up on the wall, and I was giving the ducks some bird seed. And Dad said that I used up all the cereal that wasn't wet with milk, and [laugh] I said I had given them some lettuce too. And I can't remember what else we had back there, and I can't really remember too much more about my dream. I remembered something else. I was laying on the bed naked with Clark, and Clark was asking me like, ""Can I touch your boobs?"" And I told him, ""No, of course not,"" in kind of a joking manner, but he was like trying to touch me anyway. And I was like pulling his hand away and stuff. And then he tried to touch me down lower, and I took my seat and I clawed his hand and his other hand was coming towards his chest and I bit it.

I go to find some videos to show George and we all decide to order up a video movie to watch for fun. I ask everyone if they want to do that and they agree.

Most of the squares on the grid have numbers in them. Others have nothing in them.

I was in our attic with one unidentified male companion. There was a large box full of coal which was supposedly a furnace of some sort. I raked over the coals with a long pool bridge to see if I could start a fire. (Had played pool recently). The fire started and began to flame very high (was not conscious of heat). Flames were somewhat confined by cardboard which didn't seem to burn. When flames reached ceiling we looked for fire extinguisher. Male companion get extinguisher which was hanging up in rafters; got it by climbing up in rafters; handed it down to me (hose type extinguisher). Extinguisher was leaking fluid and we weren't sure we could use it to put out fire. Was not panicky due to fire; didn't seem important after we got the extinguisher.,Negative

"I got a letter saying that I had a dentist appointment at 9pm tomorrow and it would cost $87. I also had something else to go to at 10.40[m. I went to some place and checked my phone for the Movies group and Dad had posted and I asked why he was in that group. He said Gunnar invited him. Then Dad was with me and we went out to the car. Rover and a black dog were there and it kept going in my car and then lying on top of Rover. I tried to get rid of it and it somehow 'fell up' into my car. I waited for the owner to come out and then it was tiny and in a bottle. There was a greenhouse type of thing and the door was thin and wiry, but started to crush me. Ezra and his friend were there and were ignoring me. I couldn't breathe and then managed to get away. Benjamin was then there. I was in a car with him and Mom and it was awkward. He said he was getting messages all the time recently and Mom was like 'oh, because of Izzy, she's always checking her phone' and he said he doesn't go online with his phone.",Negative
"Most of the dream I can't remember. I think I had been on a camping trip, and on the way back we stopped in something like the Star Dome; I lifted up the flap of this big rubber star shaped thing, and inside I saw what I thought were three bats. When I got out, I think I remember being back on the camping trip, in a place similar to a camp site we stayed aton a camping trip I took with my dad. Now, everything after that is a blur, but I seem to remember some man (who I think represented my father, though didn't look quite like him) being shot, and as some police man dragged him off he handed me a strawberry smoothie. I also remember meeting with the 7-8th girls, but I don't know where or why. Setting: Inside something that was star-shaped, and made of rubber, blown up like a balloon; some parking lot, unrecognizable. Characters: There were three bats with red eyes; I think my friend Chloe got in there (she went camping with us this summer); some man who I think represented my dad; the My school 7th-8th girls. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, shocked. Bats and camping are a little weird, but I think seeing my father shot (which probably came from some movie I watched) is a little disturbing. What could it symbolize? Nothing, I hope.",Negative

"It's night. I'm returning to my apartment in a dungeon-like building in New York. It's dangerous. I want to get inside. Once in, I see someone banging on the window. I should be frightened but I'm not. The small man tells me about a job offer in social work. He resembles a VN vet seen in a store last week. I go to the interview. A young black man performs a comedic act. Then a young woman tells me about the job. It's clear she has done this many times. She pitches an entry-level job as if it is exciting and desirable. Until I ask, she leaves out the actual work details, which are to administer cognitive tests to children. The location is vague. A female cashier I speak to talks up the job but I'm more interested in her bust than what she says.  I don't want this job. It reminds me of past experiences in life. I don't want it at all. I don't immediately decline, but ask the female interviewer to send me details. Then I walk towards an open area with trees and grass. There is a table with fruit on it. I accidentally drop some on the ground. Several policemen sit at the table for lunch. Recollection ends here.",Positive

"I was working at the CAS office. We had a special event going on, but I'm not sure where we were holding it. Bill C had hired three more people. One was a woman around my age. She had black hair and was about the same size and height as me. Another was a woman, probably in her early 20's, with shoulder-length black hair, thin and very pretty. The other was a man in his early 20's, somewhat short, thin, with dark hair. The young woman was in front of the group with another woman, speaking to the audience. It wasn't until later that she was working for CAS. I was sitting in the audience with the other woman. Later, the four of us are sitting together in the audience, talking. I was thinking about how great it was that I was getting along so well with these two women. The young man I could tell was going to be a troublemaker. He was sharing Bill C's office space and he felt that gave him a distinct advantage over the rest of us. He kept saying he felt bad for us that Bill C was giving him such special treatment, asking him to do certain things rather than asking the rest of us, just because he was working in that space. I patted him on the knee and said, trust me. I've had my turn being the office lackey. The things he was referring to were the kinds of things an office lackey would do. He made some comment to insinuate that I misunderstood or didn't know what I was talking about. I am looking out a window. There is a clown or some such person out there with some fireworks. He waves to a child standing inside to come out and join him. The child goes out and takes a lit firework item from the clown and throws it into a moving limousine. I was concerned for two reasons. One is that it was dangerous but the other that I thought the limousine was carrying some of our clients coming to our program. It turned out that Santa Claus and some other people were in the limousine. They all jumped out and were running around yelling. Santa's beard was on fire. I seemed more concerned about how setting Santa's beard on fire would affect this child.",Negative

"I have all that I need. Initially there is no image. I am communicating with someone, though I don't know who or how. I mentally recognize that there are four things that I need to complete something. Whoever I am communicating with is trying to get me to see that I have what I need - that I have those four things that I need. Three of them I pretty quickly get that I have those. The fourth one I seem to be struggling with, understanding or seeing or believing that I have it. These four things aren't objects, nor do they seem to be skills or knowledge. What comes to mind is what I consider to be the four elements of wellness - mental, emotional, physical and spiritual. There is a sense of calm and confidence. Matthew and I are going to a fair at VE. He is driving. We come to a place in the road where three roads form a triangle. We are at one point of this triangle, so we could go right or left. Where we need to be is on the road that is running horizontal in front of us. That is where the entrance to the fairgrounds is, directly in front of us. For some reason Matthew just cuts across the triangle instead of taking the road to the right or left and then connecting to the other. He makes a comment about now being able to see why more people don't come here, because the entrance is (difficult, or hard, or dangerous or...). There is a few inch drop-off on both sides of the road. As he cuts across I see the one, but I don't think it's that bad. He is just inching forward as though he feels it is much worse than I think it is. I'm getting concerned that it is taking him so long to cross the road because we are now in a position that if a car came from either direction and was either driving too fast or simply not paying attention they would broadside us. I'm getting very nervous and anxious. I want him to just hurry and get off of this road. I wonder why he is taking so long and being so slow about it. Then I notice that the drop-off on the other side of the road is more significant and you can't actually see how significant until you get almost on top of it. That's the entrance part of the fairgrounds. It isn't a paved road that we are pulling onto from the road. It is just dirt and sparse gravel. That's part of the reason for the significant drop. There is also a quite a dip in the fairground road that we're pulling onto. If it were raining we wouldn't have noticed that dip because it would be filled with water and the water would mask the depth. As soon as we enter we're facing a fork in the road. He chooses to take the right fork. I immediately tell him that I don't think that is the way most people enter the fairgrounds because we seem to be in a livestock area. There are barns, hay bales, a few animals, livestock trailers, and not many people. I have an image of a breaker box on a wall, like the type of box that holds the electrical breakers in your house. On the right side of the box there appear to be two keys inserted. One near the top and one near the bottom. The part of the key that goes into the box seems to be typical in size and appearance, but the head of the key appears to be about an inch and half square, noticeably larger than the head of a normal key, and/or there is something that size attached to the key. There is a similar key inserted on the left side of the box, also near the top. The one that fits into the left side near the bottom is not there. It is either missing, or I have it and don't realize it, or I have it and just haven't put it in yet.",Negative
"I was home napping. A football hero came over to visit. I got up. I offered to help him fix something to eat. I found a box of macaroni and started to boil those. I was looking for something to go with it. All I could find in the cupboard were stacks of 1 layer, frosted cakes in boxes and cellophane bags. I looked in the oven, a pan of stewed tomatoes. I stirred it with a spoon (that had holes in it).  It was not very effective. My brace was lumpy and mis-shapened. My foot hurt to walk. I was embarrassed. I tried to adjust the brace. I thought I had it on crooked. I went into an adjoining room and called to my mother. She was stepping out of the bathroom. The football guy walked by the door.

Before my lesson, I got in a simulator and practiced. At first, I was terrible. I would go up really fast and down really fast. It was really awful. I practiced enough to get the nuance that by the time it was time for my lesson I did really well.

"I saw a bit of some bad movie and this guy had a male and a female guard standing on a rocky ledge. The whole place was outside, and was rocky. There was a big ditch next to it. There was this other guy with them who was very flamboyant and gay. Something started controlling the guards and they walked off the edge, killing them. One of them got replaced by Steve Sandvoss. This girl on the internet was in love with him and she was 15. I was then at some place with Mom and Ezra. There was a TV show and something was getting killed on it. Giovanni was on it in his leaver's jacket and said ""is it live?"" and he was going to be in some movie. Then we were there and it was a Friday the 13th movie, except Robert Englund was in it. Someone decided that I was going to be the first guy to be killed and Giovanni was the girl. The place it was set at was not far away and we were walking there. The actor playing the killer, was actually a killer, and I said ""do you really trust him?"", but we had no choice but to go there. The room we went to was really green and had some red/brown in it.",Positive
"The Answering Pen  I'm in my Brain, Mind, and Behavior class. It is in one of the large quad rooms in Wonkers Hall. My friends Melanie McDyss and Erica Lange are in the class. We're going over a test that was just returned to us. I got a 54 on the test, which was the highest score. Melanie got a 53. This is the first time I've ever scored higher than Melanie. We are all asked the question, ""How do we know... (something)?"" I answer something about the bipolar spatial map in the brain. There is another question that one got credit for if they put their name, as if that is proof for their being. My answer was about driving by the Powerton power plant, where I remember something about learning a special lesson on color. When one is responding one holds a pen: the answering pen. I give the answering pen to Melanie.",Positive
"A famous woman like India's prime minister is walking down the street. She sees a car with a man in it and then a car with a woman in it. She has a premonition that the man will try to run over her and the woman will save her. As it starts to happen, I am her. I see the car coming at me and I throw myself up against a wall in defeat because I'm trapped. Then I think, ""Oh, how awful,"" and turn around in the nick of time and leap straight up seconds before he hits me. I roll over the top of the car. I yell at him, ""You almost killed me!"" He smiles and shrugs. I say, ""Give me your name and insurance."" He gives me a card. I say, ""I'll bet this is the wrong phone number."" He grins. I say, ""I'll take your license number. It is RE 7-12."" I memorize it and then walk toward school. As I near the door, I see him walking, whistling happily behind me. I say sarcastically, ""Here, allow me,"" and I open the door for him. He shrugs and accepts. As we walk in he says, ""You aren't ever going to forgive me, are you?"" He sounds upset like he doesn't understand why I'd hold a grudge on such a minor thing.",Negative
"Ezra and I were wagging. Nicolas was hanging around. We had to run past Mr Norris etc. The next day, Dad found out we were wagging. Mom had been picking us up. The next day we went to this oval place which had a tennis court. Eugene came. He saw me and then left. We all had to run through these 'accordion' doors. There were these elevator things and moving blocks which we had to jump over. It was a big Phys Ed obstacle course. I ended up in this dark room which was mainly a big hole, but had platforms with beds on them. Mr Quinlan was watching over. Eugene fell down and Darius was trying to help him. I was reading his stuff and looking at baby pictures (though it was actually all about Rafe Spall) and it had his mothers name and stuff.

"Bill C hired a bunch of new consultants. Bryan N no longer worked there. Bill C had hired another man older than Bryan N but younger than us, who was going to be working out of Bryan N's office and managing all of the new consultants. There was a young blonde woman in my office and there were 2 or 3 other people working out of an office in the back. Where the door to the supply closet is in waking life was the door to a large room where we had set up quite a few workstations. All of the new consultants were going to be working out of this office. There were two young women with black hair and one young black man. There was another woman there who was helping us with the physical aspect of getting everyone set up. It was Amy Wynne from the TV program Trading Spaces. There was a computer in the back work area that was supposed to be mine. One of the dark-haired new girls was working at it, viewing a video. It didn't look like a typical computer tower. It was sitting on top of a table and from what would be the front of the tower the computer was very recessed from the shell and it looked very dark inside the recess. I could see that the employee had inserted a VHS tape into the front of the computer for viewing. I said something about this not being my computer. Amy said the new girl had my computer at her workstation that it didn't matter which one I had. I was emphatic that it did, stating that I had certain software on my hard drive that none of the others did and I needed my own computer back. So she started making the switch. About that time Bill C walked up and I said that I didn't have an office. He asked why and I told him that one of the new people was in there. He said he would talk to the new sales manager and have him take care of it. I went in to see him and he got up immediately and started getting the new person out of my office so I could get back in there. I went to the back work area again and the two dark-haired girls were doing something at that computer. One of them said something about a Goddess. I said, Oh. That's fun. Someone I can talk to about Goddesses and things. Later I was thinking about how Bill C would react to that statement so I was thinking about how I could truthfully explain it to him so it would still be okay. My explanation went something like this. I believe in God and that God exists in each of us. I know that some people refer to God as Goddess.",Positive
Girl Writing Dream of Five  I get up and walk down stairs. My mom is teaching piano to a little girl in the living room. The girl was just going to start her lesson. She was writing her dream down. The number five is on her page. I tell my mom about the four-spirit dream that I had.,Positive

"I was walking around in a tough neighborhood with a group of friends (fraternity brother). As I walked I picked up heavy sticks until in my right hand I carried a large knife and five sticks. We crossed several individuals who looked as if they wanted a fight. We met a group of boy scouts (men of all ages) and passed them. Suddenly I seemed to realize that, the boy scouts were actually enemy soldiers invading us. I rushed back, alone, to warn our army and found that they had surrounded the enemy. We were on a group of hills around the enemy in the plain. I took a gun and started to shoot. The countryside turned into a large machine like a tank. We were on a raised portion of it and the enemy were sitting in a large section in the middle of it. After we had fired at them, we jumped down and to our surprise were captured by the enemy who were still alive. Then as an onlooker I watched loaded airplanes fly out of the machine to attack the country.",Negative

Then there was a stranger's car on a rack. His one tire was off the rim, so I gave the car a little start backwards and forced the tire as it moved and the tire went on the rim.

"I was driving cross-country -- to what end, I'm not sure.  I arrived in the city where I went to college and got to the Lingermans' house just as they were leaving to go to the ranch.  It seems I had about a week before continuing my trip, or returning, or whatever my plans were, and I told them I thought maybe I should drive up to my hometown and visit Grandpa and Grandma.  The Lingermans were already backing their VW out of the driveway, and they very sarcastically, for some reason, quoted what I had earlier written or told them, that I would spend that week in my hometown ""visiting relatives.""  Maybe they were sarcastic because what I had just told them sounded like a feeble excuse to get away, while I had already told them before that it was legitimate.   Anyway, I thought it was quite out of keeping with their character, and I was annoyed.  Still in my old college town, I believe, I left my car somewhere to have some work done on it.  When the end of the day approached, I was downtown looking on newsstands for Consumer Reports-more to tell me how to get to the place where my car was than to find out what was wrong with it.  I was afraid of not finding the place before it closed.  Without the car, I would have to walk enormous distances or take the bus, and the bus service was lousy, I knew.",Negative
Nicolas got his license (he was older than me) and so one day he had to take me school. He was swerving all over the road and went really fast. I was telling him off because you don't know what's around the corner; there could be people in the middle of the road. I was then at school. Calvin and Samantha had made a list of 'quotes'. They were random ones like 'school made' which was for Evelyn and Darius and 'Izzy's boyfriend' for Eugene. Samantha was pregnant.,Positive
"I dreamed that apparently it was my mother-in-law had some relatives come down to stay at the big house next door. There were quite a few of them altogether. We were all over there at the large house eating. One of the girls got something in her eye. One of the older men took it out with a handkerchief. Then they asked me what I thought of that for doctoring. I said, ""Fine, as long as you use a clean handkerchief."" Then one of them was using a tractor towing, it was a large tractor towing a small grass cutter at the end of a long rope to cut the grass. As he made his turn, I noticed that the line had gotten tangled up, but someone ran out and straightened it when he started pulling the lawn mower again. Some of the kids were playing in the far back of the house, and there seemed to be an excess of water back there. It was like grounds under water. That's about it. Hall: He didn't recognize who the girl and man were, but he thinks they were relatives. There were not only his wife's relatives, but his family was over to this big house. The man who was driving the tractor and the lawn mower was known to Sam. He's a physician here in town. That's wrong. This M.D. is a relative of Sam's wife. Sam doesn't remember if any of his family was there, just his wife's family. The kids that were playing out in the yard were some of her relatives too.",Negative

"My wife Anita and I were cleaning up our house that we were moving from to a new state.  We had already sold it, and the new owners had already taken possession, but for some reason we were inside finding stuff we had left behind.  We were in the attic, which was a big place, not crawl space, and there were big clumps of dust clinging to all the walls which could easily be swept off.  There was an exit to the roof, where I found a lot of old clothes that had been intended for Goodwill and somehow had been left on the roof instead; they had gotten wet from rain.  There were also some nice building materials inside.  We asked someone --a realtor, presumably-if we could leave those, and she said we could.  We were going to clean everything up, but it was going to take some time, and we didn't know when the owners would come home and what we would tell them.  Anita apparently went ahead and engaged a cleaning service, because two men came, and one of them had a vacuum cleaner.  It was such a huge task facing us, that for a moment I was actually willing to pay them to clean it.  But then I realized we were under no obligation to clean it, because the sale had already taken place, and we had no responsibility whatsoever for any conditions which may have been present when they accepted the sale or which developed later, so I let the cleaning crew go.",Positive
"I was in this kind of semi-dark house with a tile floor, and there was a stairway like ours and there was a light on in the stairwell. But I was sitting like on a wooden chair in the middle of this living room floor, and I was babysitting this little boy. And he was like jumping up and down on the couch and stuff, and I think there was a coffee table over in front of the couch, like in our living room. And, like I said, it had a tile floor and it was kind of semi-dark, but there was light coming in the window and there was light coming from the stairwell. And this boy -- he'd come over to me and he would lean on my leg and, well, how do I say it? He would get himself hot from that. And then he would go back to jumping up and down on the couch, and I think he would do it over on the couch too. And in my dream I wasn't really concerned or embarrassed. And then his mother was there, and I was sitting on that chair on his mother's lap, and he was still running around, checking over things and jumping on the couch and coming back and doing the same thing. And that was really all there was to it, and then I woke up. That was crazy!",Negative

"I concentrated in my dream and French fleet came to me and a house was thought of. Someone took my pan from my work and put a cardboard box there. Bindas was going to pick out some names from cards. He dealt me cards and when I was going to look at them, most of them were cellophane. I was walking around with only a shirt on. You could see my penis and I was ashamed for I knew people were looking at me. I brought an extension light from one part of the basement on 68th Street and put it in another part. One of them paid 13 to 1. John Bindas had a new suit of clothes. I took a good look at it. I ran my finger on it and it was so fine I could see the pimples on his leg thru the pants. I was looking for my belongings in his house. I moved the long extension cord again. I took my key out of his door. His wife walked in with two dolls, a boy and girl. I kidded him that he now had a boy and girl. I jokingly talked to the dolls and to my surprise they talked back to me. They were the image of human beings. The girl said Charley Petritus was buried today.",Negative
"I have acquired a large mansion with extensive lawns and gardens of a formal nature. I am well dressed, slim and trim, in black patent leather heels, black skirt and a purple and black flowered halter top with spaghetti straps. I look out over the vast lawn and see African dancers. I am surprised they aren't Native American like I'm used to, but realize things move on and this must be honored as well. I go out to dance with them, but stay on the outskirts of the huge circle of dancers, being careful not to be disrespectful and intrusive, but wanting to be a part of it all. I dance South American calypso kinds of steps. After that, I decide to go see how the man I've hired to clean up and weed the garden area is doing. He's been there two days now and I think I owe him $75.00 by now. I go to the garden and he's got lots of area cleaned out. The plants look like large lettuce leaves all closely grown together. Then a woman asks where the door is, and I turn and look at the house. I see where the door was and go around the house to the left and find a door. I go in to see what's inside this new shop; nothing much. I figured out it's a lunch counter, but so new the menu isn't up yet. I see Ellie eating a sort of thing like a taco/hotdog. I ask her to come over and help me retie my left strap on my halter. It's two straps that had been tied together but she chooses to tie each one separately. It seems to work. I go outside to find the gardener man to pay up my $75.00. He wants a written receipt and I say, ""I have lots of paper, no problem."" Only as I pick them up, each sheet has some scribbles or notes or lists on them. I can't find a fully blank sheet. I offer one with only a few scribbles on it (like Charla's drawings), but he refuses; it must be blank. Then I realize if I'm going to keep this vast lawn area kept up, I will have to hire a gardener full time or it will all become overgrown and wild. I look up to the windows in my mansion. I think, ""It's too bad don't have very much money or furniture, but if I carefully place things at the window, I can still manage to enjoy the view of my huge lawn and garden.""",Negative
"This dream is to a certain extent a nightmare, especially considering that the characters are related to my family. In another report I had a dream that had the same people in it. It's about my being in a town to the south of Lima, called San Vicente de Canete. I was in the main square of that place when I suddenly saw my mother and that we were trying to meet my father, and suddenly my grandmother and my aunt appeared. We looked for a way to try to not meet each other face to face. But in order to do this, we went through all sorts of obstacles and adventures, until the dream ended.",Negative
"I was walking down Euclid Ave. near 105th. I then found myself in a building. There was a room with a counter and a woman behind it (like a counter in a department store). There was a door with 4 members on it. I was supposed to get married in the room. I spoke to my dad on the phone, telling him to come to the wedding at 8:30 p.m. He told me he was wondering about if he should bring an extra tie or go home after and change his tie because he was going to see South Pacific afterwards and would get his tie stained at the wedding. He told me if I needed anything, I should ask the woman. She took me into the room off of which was a bathroom. She showed me the bathtub and handed me the soap. As I was washing, my boyfriend and my economics teacher came into the bathroom. I remember it was 8:10 and I wondered if we'd be ready on time.",Positive

"This dream takes place in the navy. It seems that I'm going to summer camp and we arrive by plane to the summer camp. The first thing I remember is that I'm in small building where everyone is to do something or other. There seems to be no one in particular in charge except for the top sergeant. He has a book of rules and regulations in his hand from which he eventually reads and there's a group of fellows in my room. It seems that later on he picks one out in particular fellows in my room. It seems that later on he picks one out in particular and bawls him out quite severely. In this group there is one new fellow. This is his first time and he's quite impressed by everything. He is commenting to someone else how amazing this sight is to see this chief petty officer chewing out an ensign. This is not the case at all. One of the men is a commissioned officer, they're both non-commissioned officers. He seems fascinated by all these rules and regulations, telling me, and _ of the things he said are not rules and regulations, but just part of the chewing out of being unmilitary or something. Then it seems that the scene switches and it's later in summer camp. They've just come back from some type of duty and again there's e a group walking into my barracks. We're all talking. Somebody mentions the fact that there's someone upstairs who is renting a room. This is somewhat unusual on a military base. It turns out to be a sailor who has gotten a leave or discharge or something and he is unable to leave for one week, so he has to remain there as civilian personnel for a week and rent a room. There was somebody with this guy who was renting the room. Then someone recalls that we had landed at the beginning of summer camp and gone to this peculiar little shack like building, the first thing and we had to laugh about it, how typically disorganized things are. This is supposedly a chief example. There's one character who appears in this dream that I know from school. His name is Clay. He's a rather snobbish, obnoxious sort of person. He just appeared vaguely in the dream. Day residue: I start summer camp in a number of hours actually. This character named Clay is in the naval reserves. I've been speaking quite a lot today about summer camps and how quickly things are always fouled up in the military service.",Negative
"My dream took place during school, at a place in the hallway where many people meet between classes. There is this girl I know who has been flirting with my boyfriend (in real life), and that day I had gotten very mad at her for that reason. I may have been thinking about it before I fell asleep. But in my dream, Natalie is sitting on the brick bench in that part of the hall right next to my boyfriend. I'm walking up the hall and I see them. She's staring at him and talking and he's sort of flirting back. All of a sudden when I reach them, she kisses him on the cheek. I yelled something at her, and hit her across the face so hard that her head hits the cement wall behind her. My boyfriend is just sitting there with his mouth sort of open, surprised.

And I was looking in the refrigerator while I was waiting for my grandmother to be ready to go, because my grandmother was also going to go on the walk with me. I was looking in it and seeing the different foods, and the light, the way it came on in our fridge when I was younger and I could still see.

"Joe Bacon played Essakno or Essemonetta, some name like it, and it was a winner and paid $79. I was driving along the highway and found a spot where to park and I went to see a fellow who owned a lot of property to hunt on it, but he wouldn't give me the satisfaction of ownership. I went for a stroll and when I came back, I met the owner and I told a little fellow that the owner thought I was a gangster I was on Broadway Ave. I walked up to 72 St., then started to walk to the north and there was a big horse following me as I went along. I didn't like it because I was a little afraid of him. I was in the city.",Negative
"(06/15/1999) Evelyn  and I were in the darkroom. There was a very complicated process for processing film. The first part was the regular way. Then the part took several weeks. The film strip was very long. About 30 feet. After processing it you had to swim underwater to the island (1/2 mile there, 1/2 mile back = 1 mile total); and the man was there trying to rent out lifejackets--which were not necessary or even practical, because you had to swim underwater to process the film. Then when you got back the reverse negative printing took place. return from swimming 1 mile underwater with negatives held anchored in mouth. 2. heat water until steam and bubbles come up and the water boils out; salt crystals will have formed all over the scorched but not burned pot; attach 33 gallon black trash bag to enlarger between light source and easel. You are now ready to begin printing the reverse negative full size prints. Exposure time: 2 weeks. It was time to go, William said and Evelyn was waiting the 2 weeks for her paper to expose. Since she was still working, I dumped out my empty oatmeal box full of crayons and searched frantically for 'periwinkle blue.' Some crayons were broken. Some were not. I found cobalt blue but it wasn't the same. They had changed the color names to be politically correct.",Positive
"I will give my talk on Tuesday. On Monday I get a tryout at the house of an old man I know, attended by some people, among them Freud. I make a few false starts, but finally I get it right and say, convinced that this is true, ""Everywhere where people dream they think that they are in an entirely real world."" An old man to my right shakes his head vehemently. ""That is not true,"" he exclaims. ""I don't agree either,"" Freud adds. I am flabbergasted, realizing how true I thought this reality to be. I am flustered. People begin to leave. I sit back on my chair again. The room is now almost empty, except for Freud and some stragglers. ""Well, I must be going,"" Freud says. I still want to talk to him. ""So, Dr. Freud, you don't believe that the dream world is real?"" ""No,"" he replies. ""While dreaming you never reach the boy. And you'll always stay at a distance from the things that you are afraid of."" ""That is true,"" I say, ""but that doesn't make it less real."" ""Well,"" Freud responds, ""that's not the case. You're wrong."" This old man Freud, who doesn't look like Sigmund Freud--his face is much rounder--speaks with certainty. He wipes my argument away with absolute authority. I say, almost desperate, that everywhere in the world where I've discussed dreams, people always considered the dream environment real while dreaming. ""Well,"" he concludes, ""research the dream reports of one hundred and one dreamers and you'll see that it is not true."" Then he leaves. I sit in my chair, totally stunned. I want to write a letter to Freud to get back to this discussion. But I know that he is long dead. That I can't write an old letter. I know that I am in two worlds. Then I realize that if I send it to the Berggasse in Vienna, Freud's home address, it will obviously be a new letter and it won't get anywhere because Freud lived long ago. I am sad that I won't be able to reach Freud to continue the discussion.",Negative
"I am at a church service and there is a kids play going on. I am with two of my ""best friends"" from grade school, Barbara and Joan.

"The predominant background for the dreams practically throughout the night was a scene of little activity in the sense of, well, you take like a block in a city and people just sitting. There are just a few here and there together as if, well, baseball season is over so we'll just sit and wait for next year or something. I guess there's no activity. This seems to have been present for dreaming for a whole night. Upon awaken, I was talking or saying something to a young girl. I have no idea who it was. It was jus as if it was someone who just happened to be on this sort of block. She was turning off as if to leave the area. I do not recall what I said. As I said before, I don't know who it was. It seems as if in most of the dream I was talking with someone in the sense of different people in different towns. There was hardly any activity as I said earlier, just talking as if someone had come across on this inactive block or street, like a square, with nothing in the middle, just grass. Like I said, people, a lot of people, just a couple of people here, a couple people there, sitting on benches. It seems as if everybody was just waiting. Again, I had the feeling that now that season's over, just sit here and wait, and it seemed like the predominant thoughts were of sports and baseball. Most of the people waiting seemed to be old men. The benches were white. Again like I said, there was very little activity.",Positive
"For some reason I had to go back to the office building where the CAS office is located. Obviously, I was very bothered by this, wished that it could be avoided, but knew that it couldn't. I was trying to figure out a way that I could go where I needed to in the building but avoid running into Bill C or anybody else there or to avoid even going by the office or to risk being seen by any of them. Most importantly I didn't want to come face-to-face with any of them, especially Bill C. I must have seen someone from the distance because I decided to go in to the women room thinking that I could go in there and actually go in one of the stalls and just stay there for a little while and give whoever it was time to get where were they were going. If I'm in one of the stalls then there's no chance of Jennifer C coming in and seeing me. And if I just wait for a little while then I can slip out and get where I need to go without seeing any one or without being seen. I'm thinking now about how I can get back to my car without being seen or without seeing any one. I think about going to the far end of the building by the deli to exit the building and then walking around the outside to my car because if I walk around the back of the building they would have to actually be back there for them to see me or for me to run into one of them and that would be highly unlikely. I don't know if I had parked at the front of the building where I usually parked or if I had parked at the one and where I sometimes parked. If I was parked on the end then there would be just a miniscule chance of seeing someone or being seen. If I was parked at the front my chances increase considerably because they might see me through a window or I might run into one of them in the parking lot since that's where they parked as well. Maybe I was just thinking that I should have parked at the end of the building recognizing that then it would have reduced my chances greatly of seeing one of them or being seen by one of them. Regardless of any of this, I was unsuccessful. I came face-to-face with Bill C. We were only a few feet apart when we realized that the other was there. So there was no chance of acting as though we hadn't seen each other. I looked up at him and didn't say anything immediately. I get the sense that it bothered me a lot more than it bothered him to run into each other. I think he recognized this and was trying to be especially pleasant or friendly. I think he probably knew how much I didn't want to see him. I may be recording this in the wrong order. Alot of this doesn't make sense to me. I am in their office suite to do something. I was talking to Jane C and as in previous dreams she was sympathetic with me about what happened and seemed to be on my side. She also suspected that I did not want to see Bill C. So when it was time for me to leave she said that she would go into his office and stand at the end of his desk and talk to him so that I could go out the front door of their sweet without him seeing me and without me seeing him. She offered to do this because I would have to walk by his office door to get out of the office suite. There were several women working there. Jennifer C didn't work there anymore though. The receptionist was now a woman with a very unusual name something like Oneka. I recall seeing it on something on the wall or maybe on a tall file cabinet. It's in big block letters may be you when you try block letters. I would guess her to be around 60 years old she appeared to be in very fit, good physical condition and a nicely dressed her hair was nicely taken care of in a style that you might expect to see on someone 70 years old. Very pretty silver-gray hair. I don't know if she knew that I had worked there before or even if she did I don't know if she knew anything about what had transpired especially regarding my leaving the company. I'm having a conversation with these women which included Jane C and the receptionist, it seems that the conversation is about things that they're working on right now or the ways that they are you are doing things right now or maybe some of the changes that have taken place since I've left. I'm having a conversation with Bill C and it seems that he is trying very hard to mend fences. He's trying to do this, though, without actually mentioning anything that happened. Certainly he's trying to do so without any apologies or accepting any responsibility for anything that happened. I had a sense that my name had come up in conversations between him and Bill C over the past year and that it wasn't in a positive or flattering way. I know how sarcastic bill can be. I know that he doesn't always speak kindly of other people. For some reason I think that when my name came up it was related to specific events or situations or maybe specific things that I did or put in place while I was there. Bill C and I are walking out to the parking lot as we continue to talk. As we approached the door of their office suite I hear Bryan N behind us make some kind of a wisecrack. I think he said, maybe like the directory? He was implying that there was something negative about AE directory that I may have created while I was there. I don't recall creating any directories but I have a feeling that he was referring to the new employee manual. I nor Bill C acknowledge what he said. We just keep walking. After we get outside the building in the parking lot I said to Bill C that I suppose he and Bryan N have had a lot of laughs at my expense over the last year. His response was a sarcastic agreement with me as though he was trying to make me believe that it wasn't true. One of the things that I learned about Bill C though, that was his way of avoiding admitting that he had done something inappropriate or wrong or hurtful to someone, especially if he was aware of it at the time he was doing it.",Negative
"I'm having tea and sandwiches in a cafe garden in Sri Lanka with Juan. It's my treat. This place feels more like my country than Sri Lanka in terms of the countryside. I ask for the bill. It comes to something ridiculous - far too expensive for Sri Lanka - about four times what it should be. I get very angry with the waiter and refuse to pay that much. He insists that is the price and ends up getting very upset, because he says his boss will take it out of his wages if we don't pay. So I give him all my money but I'm still slightly short, so I start scrabbling around on the ground under the table for dropped coins. I do find some, but one of them is fake - it's a very soft metal. So I finally leave owing the waiter the rest. I intend to return to pay him. Juan doesn't have anything to contribute.",Negative

I notice Jerome's eyes look odd, sort of big with wrinkles around them. He is standing at my desk and I go near his desk. He says to me, ""Are you intending to use my desk or yours?"" I again am aware of wanting to be obliging and say, ""Oh, my desk, of course. It would be silly to change desks since yours is already set up.""

Soon after, there were lots at his door and he was stabbing them all with sharp things and then he found his mother and asked if all the doors and windows were locked. She said they were. They closed the blinds and snuck along under the windows. They looked out a window and they could see the entrance of the store (the store was circular). There were some vampires lining up. They went out another entrance and they turned around and started coming at him. He managed to kill all of them.

"I was reading about the Arrested Development movie. Michael Cera had said he wasn't going to do it, presumably because he thought he could do better. I was like ""how can you do better than Arrested Development? It's the third best show ever... and that's pushing it"" (as in, the top 3 are all so good, it's hard to make them lower than the other). There weren't any comments from David Cross at all. There was a character called Gaius. I was talking to this guy (I was me, but different) because I wanted to get into some film group. He mentioned something and I said that ""I'm not wanting to sound like Battlestar Galactica"" but he refused. Someone said something and shot all others (it's hard to read).

To the left and in front of the toilet were two closet kind of spaces, but instead of doors there were shower curtains. They had so much stuff in them that the shower curtains were pushed out a bit rather than hanging straight down. I pulled the curtain in front of me to the side a bit to look inside. I was talking to one of the sisters about professional closet organization. They had either won the service or someone was donating it. I was telling her it wasn't going to be anything elaborate or expensive, but rather something simple, neat and yet much more functional than what they have now.

"The dream seemed to take place in the same locale as 096 and out on the porch of this house there was some apparatus set up for an unusual game, a game of skill, it was supposed to be. I don't understand now how it could really work, but there was a sort of rectangular box, say about 2 feet long and a foot wide, and in the center of this you place this little flat circular thing to which one end and shading into it very nicely and geometrically was this triangle pointer so that overall the thing was sort of cone-shaped. And on the bottom of this there was sort of a circular part with sort of a pointed piece of metal that stuck down, and I guess several other something had to be there to balance the thing. And you place this in the center pointing to one corner of the box. And then in the opposite corner you were supposed to do something in some manner with your own hands without actually touching the disk thing which would make it go up to and get to this other corner and have the pointed end of the triangle touch the corner. And it was a very delicately balanced thing. As a matter of fact, now that I remember, there was a little pointer underneath the pointed end of the triangle too and the whole thing was so sensitively mounted that any little thing would jar it. And as a matter of fact, it was picking up all these seismic waves, supposedly earthquakes all around, and there were so many earthquakes, however it seemed sort of strange there would be so many because this thing was constantly moving. And the method, I can't understand the method by which you were supposed to get this thing moving, going in the right direction, because really you weren't supposed to touch any part of the thing with your hands because it was some sort of parapsychological phenomenon. But it was supposed to have something to do with magnetism and that's really all I remember of this very complicated game.",Negative

"I was climbing down a very steep mountain with a girl whom I don't know and going to see some friends of ours in a jail, apparently during a war or something. While walking along this narrow path, I told the girl to watch out because there was a quicksand pit up ahead. We walked around that, and then when we went a little further, there was this 6 ft. wall on the left, and it had bars like the bars of a cell. There was warm lava coming down the mountain and in order to keep from falling down, we grabbed onto these bars and started going hand over hand to this jail cell. When we got to it, I climbed down to the window that was guarded by bars and I felt kind of guilty because I wasn't in there with them, and I asked if there was anything I can get for them since I was outside. One guy wanted a bottle of wine and told me the exact name of the wine and I remember writing the name on the wall next to the barred up window. Then I retreated from the window and found myself in a 4-walled one-story building with only part of a roof. While walking out of this building I saw some men running at me who were part of an army or something. They were running at me with machine guns because I had been talking with the prisoners. They were shooting the guns. I had a bottle of wine on me for this man, but I don't know where I got it from. The wine turned into a pint bottle of Vodka. I know Vodka was combustible, so I threw it out the window of this 4-walled structure and I figured that the army would keep firing at it with their bullets and it would catch on fire, and it did. It got on fire that which spilled out of the bottle, but the bottle itself didn't catch on fire. One of the men reached over and grabbed the bottle and threw it back into this four-walled structure where I was. Figuring it would go off, I ran outside and found myself in the company of this beautiful young German blond. Apparently she was a ballet dancer or a girl who was interested in gymnastics or something. She was very graceful in her movements and she was showing me certain movements and certain steps and said she could show me these steps better if we would go inside the gym. There was a half-constructed gym, it still had sanded floors and wooded beams supporting the interior of it. We went in and she started showing me these graceful movements and what not.",Negative
"Caught Closing Early  I go into the Middle Mall the same night that I closed the mall early. There are few people inside. Another employee, Bill, is in the office, which is in the mall now, instead of being a back room. I talk to him. He says I'm in luck: our boss Andy isn't here. I tell him why I have closed the mall early. He says they still like to have someone at the mall until 10:00 pm. Another employee, Dale, has some photographs of different sizes. They have a pornographic feeling to them. Some of the photographs are of good-looking men; others are of giant cartoon characters.",Positive
"A large rather horseshoe-shaped house - name ""hacienda"" comes to mind - I think it has red tile roofs, some parts are 2-story. A large group of people are staying here - house is neither my house nor a hotel, or an apartment building as far as I can tell, it may be an institution of some kind, like a school. The people here are more or less homogeneous - mostly my age, equal men and women - all engaged in something, which I think is putting on some kind of production. We operate together, but there's a lot of us and we have smaller groups for various tasks. [The house is old but not antique-y like some of my others. Lots of greenery around, reinforces the Mexican look of the place - or Southwestern, anyway. Whatever it is, it's a well-established one, comfortable and well-suited.] I'm in a back hallway, darkish, the only light comes from a window in the outside door at the end and a light on the telephone ""booth"" - one of those wall-things. Somebody who reminds me of Nan is using the phone. I wait for her and someone comes by us. For some reason I'm concerned, don't know why. Goes on down the hall. ""She"" finishes her call and we go down the hall ourselves and out and around to a gathering of people in a large, bright room with a lot of long tables in, I suppose, it's a dining hall. I don't see any food but maybe we're just finishing a meal. Anyway, we're all talking amongst ourselves and the guy who walked down the hall comes in and starts to berate me. It's all a lot of nonsense, he's really quite wrong, but he's really wild and seems to be coming unglued. Somebody (I think the guy next to me) faces him about it and he says (to wit) ""Aha! You think I can't/won't do anything about this! We'll see about that!"" And he brings out a large cobra. Everybody gasps and pulls back and he threatens with it like a madman and runs it over his fingers and all. I seem to be the most panic-stricken and I run, after I stare at it mesmerized for a minute, looking to see if it really is a cobra and if it isn't maybe this isn't so bad, but I think it is and this is big-time serious. I run out of the place and he follows. I run across the courtyard to a set of stairs and a little bitty sub-courtyard/patio and ask if they'll hide me. [Apparently not - I know I am back in that hallway again. May have been before the stairs or not. I do spend rather a while running from this guy. I am really afraid of that snake - they are really poisonous.",Negative
"There were two girls and myself sitting around a table in H-- Hall. We were watching a fellow and girl come down the steps. Each of us knew the fellow and one by one we told each other of our experiences with him. Each story was similar to the other. There was a fourth vacant chair and we expected the girl he was with to fill it. Interpretation I went all summer with the fellow in the dream. There are two other girls I know who have gone with him in the past and have had the same outcome - when he feels both are getting too serious, he stops dating the girl because he can see himself with a girlfriend but not a wife. Now he is going with a fourth girl who probably we all unconsciously hope or expect to end up the same way as we did. Answers to questions 2. Complete relaxation. Fun over conversations.3.

"I was taking this music class on Saturdays from 10:00 to 11:00 at Westport College, and it was kind of put that way loosely because we could go whenever we wanted. And it was supposed to be so that it could be getting credit without actually interfering with the rest of my schedule. And so I went there and it was given by this man, this kind of older man, on this huge front porch of this building. It was almost like a stage that this class was given on. And there were like five or six people who were in a van and the rest of us who were just kind of like there. And I guess we were going to take turns being in the van or something. But he was telling us how when one person leads you have to follow them, and if they decide to do one thing or another, it's kind of disrespectful to ask them about it. It's really just the opposite. And so I think we did the Bruce Hornsby song that I've been listening to, I think that's just the way it is. And I wanted to talk to the guy, but the guy thought that I was coming over to criticize him, and he ran. And then I dreamt that my place where I was studying ethics was like up high on a cliff, and I was going to find a better place, but it was so hot. And I dreamt that Merrilee was involved in all this because she was kind of the music teacher's assistant, and they were holding this seminar on a Saturday, and they weren't sure who was coming. And I said I was coming, but I didn't know about anybody else. And that's pretty much it, I think.",Positive

"Moose With Calf  I'm moving in a vehicle of some sort with another person. We are going past a wooded area. I tell the person to go slower, to look for moose. At the end of the forest we see the backside of a moose! We slow and stop, looking at it. The moose backs out of the brush, and we see it has a calf climbing on it, like a young monkey climbs on its mother. The calf is about _ the size of the cow. I tell the other person to keep our distance from them, because of the calf. We move away, down the road.",Negative

"Nete or Nate Nelling  I get a ride home from school with my friend Sal Watson in his truck. At the same time, I bike in the snow and the rain. I get tired out. When I get home, there is a note from my friend Hannah Reed to call her. I know it's her because she spells her name with an ""H"". My mom is just leaving when I get home. My sister Heather is still in the hospital. My friend Nete Nelling just called. He actually spells his name Nate, but I know that now it is Nete. He has strep throat and cant' go to the baseball game or the Olympic Volleyball with me like we had planned. Nate and I sit in a bar on the floor and talk. He had a tough trip with his girlfriend Emily. He drinks a Killian's Red. I swing on a gymnastics bar and try to touch my feet on a piece of light green paper on the floor. I have a beer. Nate tells me about Emily's father Dick, and how Dick never used to let Nate drink beer. Now Dick lets Nate drink beer; ""Just as long as I don't want one,"" Nate says.",Negative
"First there is a war going on. I wear a helmet and a bullet hits me on the top of my helmet as I am lying down in a crouched position. I pick up the spent bullet for a souvenir. I was lucky and the bullet didn't harm me. Now Jennifer H is very sad. Her girlfriend is going to commit suicide. She will drink poison and die. A woman like Katrina is there. I drink the poison too. I am afraid and yet calm. My death is certain now. It's a weird thought that my life is ending NOW. I lie down. I notice Jennifer sitting on the floor near her girlfriend. The girlfriend is in the last throes, gasping and all bound up like in a cocoon or shroud. She turns her face toward Jennifer to say something to her. Her face is contorted. She changes her mind because it's too exhausting to struggle against the enclosing death. I realize I am nearly at that stage now, my poison worked faster than hers. I suddenly think of my girls and how sad I won't be there to watch them grow up. I ask Katrina for paper and pen to write my last wishes. I think of my girls, then I think of my women's group friends and then I look at some of my writing (on yellow legal pad paper) and say, ""Well, some of this was pretty good."" It seems so strange that I am about to be nonexistent, inconceivable.",Negative

I tell him I'm going to kick his ass on the court. I am then in the practice and I'm determined to do well. The practice is some sort of aerobics/dance/basketball practice. I have no, or bad, shoes on, and have no traction. My mom is there. She talks to the coach or instructor.

"I arrived in a sort of historical park, having come in from a train or perhaps carriage ride.  I looked around in a sort of barn museum.  My parents were around somewhere.  I remember circling the barn, perhaps looking or waiting for them.  At some point later, I was like the rocketeer, I believe it was.  I left the dark wood-paneled office of the lawyer, as if someone had died.  The scenery as I flew like riding an elevated BART train.  Saw an apartment building with half the walls missing.

"I'm in my bedroom and I see two cages, one for my guinea pig and one for the hamster I used to have. I look into what I think is the hamster's cage, and I'm surprised to see she's still alive. All of a sudden, the ""hamster"" is out of the cage, and there's some dialogue (between me and the hamster?). Then, she's on the floor and starts running. She runs downstairs and I'm afraid a cat might get her (until I realize she's a guinea pig, not a hamster). There is a very wide kitchen door that I try to close but the guinea pig gets out of the house. As soon as she sees the outside, she runs even faster across the street and keeps going. I run after her. I see her in the yard across the street but then she keeps running. She runs a little further into someone's backyard, where there are leaves all around. My grandmother is there, and I try to tell her to be careful where she walks because the guinea pig could be under the leaves. Then, all of a sudden my grandmother sits down on the ground, and says something which I don't remember. I think she might have stepped on the guinea pig, but it was right next to her. There's a puddle or small pond in the yard, and the guinea pig then swims through it. I manage to pick her up while she's in the water. She seems to be purring like a cat, and it seems all she needed was a bath.",Negative

"I was walking down a ramp with a strong feeling of having done something of great importance. As I walked along, one woman said to another (although I was not conscious of seeing either) that mine would have made the sixth abdication in a century. I had a feeling then of belonging to English royalty.  As I went into the street, it was raining, and I had to walk carefully, for it was very slippery. It was at night, and the lights from the shops on the streets reflected on the wet pavement. I began to cry, and a friend of mine came up to me to beg me not to commit suicide. I assured her that I wouldn't, saying that a five-minute walk in the rain would fix me up completely. I then lay down on the pavement and cried and cried. Interpretation My act of abdication produced in me a most intense feeling somewhere between the martyristic and brave ""I can take it"" attitude. My friend who begged me not to commit suicide, I realize, has appeared before in a minor part in a recent dream. I do not know why, for I see her seldom, and am not on intimate terms with her, although we have known each other since kindergarten days.

However, I was waiting on an elderly woman customer who couldn't make up her mind what kind of drapes she wanted to buy. She kept taking up my time all afternoon, so that I was unable to go to lunch at all. Finally I became so irate that I became very antagonistic toward the woman. She informed the supervisor, and he told me to be more courteous and wait on the lady. Finally she decided on the purchase, paid me, and left. The currency she paid me looked rather suspicious to me at the time, but I angrily went on about business.

"Jo V moved in with me at 2 am one morning. I didn't realize that she had until someone told me. It seems as though I went to the backroom, of the show Cheers. Carla came back. It was really a mess. There was stuff everywhere, stuff all over the floor, paper all over the floor. I was trying to clean up and Carla was trying to help me. There were playing cards all over the floor. She was picking them up and putting them together. I said, No. No. There are different kinds so we have to sort them by deck. We started sorting them. Now we were in this large house. It was an older house, very cool house, with many rooms. I went to this one room that was being used for storage. I could hardly get the door open. There were all kinds of Mickey Mouse and Walt Disney things in there. I thought it was very cool. I suggested to someone that we should use it to create a Mickey Mouse Room or something similar. When I heard that Jo V had moved in, I went back to that room with the intention of clearing it out for Jo V to move into. She had already done that. It looked very nice. She had set up her computer equipment in a big, open room. It had three tables, set together in u formation. She had at least one very unusual piece. It was a rectangular computer screen, I think. Very long but not very high. There were several children. Jo V and I were showing them something on the computer. There was something about these children needing to go to bed or go to sleep. There was also something about criminals. Maybe they once owned the house and were now trying to get it back but weren't able to. At one point I may have been a teenager. I wanted to go someplace or with someone and was being told I couldn't. I was figuring out how I was going to sneak out and do what I wanted.

"I was dreaming about a man who was relating a story to this, he looked like an Omar Sherif, and he was telling us how he was taking these candid camera-like shots through an electern with a hole in it.

It was s special offer deal where you send the film into so and so, and they would send it back to you. It was easy to take the film out.

"There was something going on before, but I don't remember what it was. All I remember now about this dream was that I was having my whole room, my studio, repainted, and not just that, but we were having the kitchen and I think the stairwell and the studio repainted, maybe even Mom's room. And some things were all messed up and turned upside down and messed around, and you know how it is. And I was in my room here, and they had just finished repainting it, and it was twice the size that it usually is, I think because when we were repainting it when I was 16 just before my birthday, we did repaint it, and it was like, it looked twice the size when all the shelves and everything were out, and my desk was out because it was being repainted. And anyway, I came in and they were starting to move furniture back in, in my studio after the paint job, and my desk was like big and black and the top was wooden, but the bottom was like plastic, you know how modern things are. And on my south wall there was this cart with like a ton of books on the bottom and a ton of CD's on the top, and it was like real ____ and said that it came from like a friend who was cleaning out the closet. And I could go through their CD's and books and keep any of the ones that I wanted for like DJ stuff. And so I started looking through them in a very orderly manner, and I laid a few on the side that looked like good party mixes that I was going to put on and listen to once my sound system was back together, because only furniture, but nothing else, was in there at this point. And then Dad came in when I had like two or three laid aside, and he was saying something like, ""Do you think you can put all this stuff back together?"" meaning the sound system and all the equipment. And he said, ""Then after you do that, you can resume and maintain your privacy,"" or something like that, and I said, ""Sure, I think I can do that."" So even though it was like a monumental task -- not only the sound system, but the mixer and the computer and everything was like all, all the components and everything were just laid out on my bed. And he was like, ""I think that attempt is going to fail. I know it's going to fail."" And then I woke up.",Positive

And Mrs. Dougherty was kind of pacing around and talking to us, like she does, and kind of instructing the other people as to how they were supposed to stand and all when we went on stage, and then all of a sudden, in poured the class and they were noisier than anything. And they were just real loud and ruckussy in their sound filled the auditorium, and trying to get everybody quieted down, I don't remember exactly how. But we were supposed to be taking pictures for the yearbook, I guess, and everybody had to be in long pants and some kind of a shirt, which really didn't make a whole lot of sense, but that's how it was in my dream. And then Mrs. Dougherty was explaining how some of the boys were so fat that they couldn't even sit down in their chairs. And then I woke up and it was like 6:00. Then I went back to sleep and I had another dream. I dreamt, first of all, that I was in my bedroom and that it was daylight. And I had this bathtub full of Christmas decorations, which that's the place I was storing my presents for Christmas. But I was taking the bears out and putting them around, and this one bear I hung on the door, and it was this snoring musical bear where it had a three-way switch to just snore or just snore and play music too. And the other thing was this reindeer. It was just like the mechanical one that I used to have, only the mechanical one doesn't run any more. But in my dream the mechanical part didn't run, but for some reason it was playing 94.9 and it was sound, and that just made me go bananas in my dream. [laugh] I closed my door, I closed both of my doors so they latched in my dream, and [whispering] I kind of perched on the bed and then it was the bathtub that I perched on. It was so wild that I was kicking my legs around and stuff, and I was holding onto the railing. [regular voice again] Oh, that was another one of those embarrassing dreams. I hope nobody ever listens to this tape.

"I was so excited during this dream as I realized that I was lucid and was sharing this with my family. They didn't know quite what to think. Many of my siblings and in-laws were there with their children. But the children were much younger and not in the same chronological age order, or not represented as such by size, than in waking life. The first time I realized that I was lucid is when Chris A was just a baby and Matthew was about three times his size. I said, Hey, you men this is a dream! They all looked at me kind of funny, not quite sure how to respond. I said you can tell because look at the difference in sizes between Chris A and Matthew. Chris A is significantly older than Matthew is and it should be the other way around. I don't know if we are all having this dream or if it is simply that I am lucid, but this is definitely a lucid dream. We went about what we were doing, changing diapers, working in the kitchen, eating cookies and such. Mari Kate S had curlers in her hair and was very small. Chris A came up to me again but this time he was about 4 times the size he was earlier. I said to everyone Look, another example of this being a dream. Chris A is now 4 times larger than he was a couple of minutes ago! This is so cool!",Positive
"My Dad Gets Stopped  I'm with my dad in a car he is driving. We turn from Friends Avenue in Wilmerton onto Main Street going west. There is a police car across from us. My dad went through a red light. The police car lights come on. My dad pulls over, then drives farther, and finally pulls over by Farm Store. The police officer is female. She asks my dad for license and registration. I open the glove compartment. It is cluttered with five or six ice scrapers, lots of little notebooks, and a bag of small oval insurance cars, less than a couple inches long. The cards are gold colored and have names written on them.  The officer is riding in the back of our car. We are near my home in Oak Valley. We pull over. I get out and start looking at all the little insurance cards. I tell my dad he is not taking any of this seriously; his attitude is ""Oh, well..."" My friend Nate Nelling pulls up in front of my dad's car. He and his girlfriend Emily Zates were going to stop by about 8:30 that night. My friend Stephen Ramos is at my house, but I have to ride with the officer and my dad back to Farm Store so she can get her car. We start off down Home Avenue, where there is a stop sign halfway down the big hill. My dad goes through it, without stopping, slowing only a little bit. I scold him, telling him his easygoing attitude and laid-back ways get him into trouble.",Negative

"This dream is really something produced by fantasy, although the previous night I had several encounters with those people who are actually repudiated by society; I am referring to homosexuals. The dream starts when I and some classmates from the university go on a trip to the center region of Peru. When we are around Chosica, we see a reform school for that sort of person, and before our eyes they continued to behave in a rather unmasculine way, as though our presence didn't disturb them, and furthermore, they were offending us men. Therefore, we began to criticize them, until one of them picked a fight with me and we started to hit each other, until after a long effort I was able to defeat him. That's all.",Negative

Ginny says, ""Now it looks like French provincial, not that dark, brooding Victorian brown you had painted them before."" I agree that it looks nice.

Jumping fence after fence, in what seemed to be the same paddock, my horse was frantically trying to escape these men. Finally the strange men must have given up for I heroically entered the paddock and easily captured him. I remember bridling him and then what happened I don't know for I seemed to be on some sort of a wooden contraption that bobbed up and down in an odd way.

As we moved out of the pew, Matthew stayed in front of me instead of minding his manners, stepping back, and allowing me to walk in front of him. I tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around and looked at me. He immediately realized what he had done so he stepped to the side for me to get in front of him.

"I am delivering a guest lecture for a colleague in a modern college auditorium which has a lot of high-technology audio- visual aids set up. The audience in the lecture hall is small, but a video camera broadcasts my face to a medium-sized television screen. I feel that I am not effectively making my point, which is about books written by a forgotten author. While still talking, I fumble around with cables, trying to connect the video signal to a larger screen. Finally it works and my image appears on a movie-sized screen hanging from the ceiling. I feel more confident now because this picture is much more impressive than before. I show one book by a favorite author -- I can't remember who -- , holding it up to the camera for all to see. In it is a bibliography, which I read aloud. As I read each new book's title, I hold up that book, and its front jacket appears on the huge screen above.  Every book is more obscure, and harder to find, than the previous one. These books are precious and meaningful to me, but I wonder whether I am getting through to the audience.",Positive
"Several days ago I dreamt I was recently married to a young man I know well. He showed me the apartment in which we were to live.

He assured me that it was to be only our temporary home. We arrived at the place so late at night that it was nearly morning. Suddenly I noticed an older woman. My husband explained to me that she came to hide here while I was asleep. Then the door opened and a man's voice said: ""Is my mother here?""",Positive

It was sorted by categories such as alcoholic, non-alcoholic, wedding night etc. There were windows all around the house (it was like made of windows except for one wall).

"I, the dreamer, is watching a scene. I seem to identify with the married man. A woman and a man get married after a short, but loving, courtship. Soon after they are married, they begin to have misunderstandings and fights. They are always angry at each other and can't seem to reconcile it. They are miserable, yet they love each other. There is another man, an architect, who loves the woman and she goes to visit him. The jealous husband, who has another kind of career, follows her and comes into the house. The two men talk. The husband is angry and belligerent, but after a while the other man begins to understand that the husband is a good man, but hurt. So he helps the husband understand, and brings the woman and the husband back together, even though he still loves her. But now he is best friends with the husband and cares as much for him. The husband and the woman go out to the car to drive home when the woman's parents come to get in the back seat. They are argumentative and negative at the husband, who in his new-found understanding, doesn't tolerate it anymore. He tells them to shut up. The woman at first is upset and then understands that is right. She smiles at the husband. [BL]",Negative

"I was working in a large office. There were quite a few employees and many rooms or offices. I don't know who all of the employees were. One of the employees was Cameron Mannheim from a TV show about attorneys. I suspect that it is a law office but I don't think it was because of her. There is also a baby at the office. I think the baby belongs to one of the employees. We are watching the baby while the employee is away. I'm the one that gets stuck changing all of the diapers. No one else seems willing. I couple of times I picked the baby up and felt the diaper and realized that he needed to be changed. The baby's name is Brian. My brother Brian F is in one part of this dream. I am pointing to each of them saying, Big Brian, little Brian. I said it a couple of times, as if I am introducing them to each other but I say it more than twice. I leave the baby in the kind of seat that you lay newborns in. I thought I had left him with Cameron - that she was going to watch him for a few minutes. When I went back to Cameron to get him he wasn't there. She said, What do you mean where is he? I just walked away for a minute. I panicked prior to that thinking that I might have walked away without making sure that Cameron was going to watch him for me. When she said that I was reassured that she had agreed to keep an eye on him. We panicked because he wasn't there. We started going to all of these rooms or offices to look for him. Alot of these rooms were two rooms in one. The first room was small, maybe 8 ft by 8 ft. At the back of the room was a door to another room that was an even smaller square. We would go in each, open both doors to check and the moving on to the next. We were going all over. Cameron had gone into one room and a man came out. I think there was a meeting with some attorneys going on in that room. This man had on a white shirt with a tie. He was balding, short, small frame. He said, well, we may have what you're looking for. Then another attorney came out holding little Brian. He said, We just thought you might like a break from watching him. I'm thinking, Well that's great but you don't just take him without telling anyone. He had him bundled up in a blanket and hat and such. I wondered why he had him so bundled up because we were indoors and it wasn't cold.",Negative

She said I could leave, so I left, but I forgot my backpack. I didn't realize that I didn't have it until I was at the store. I went back to work and asked my manager for my backpack.

"This dream is fragmented. First there was an awkward scene. I was in a bar. It was fairly spacious and mostly empty with black walls, a very high ceiling, and tall chairs on chrome posts with round black tables. I was having a drink with my partner. I went to the bar, and on the way bumped into some ex-university colleagues. I got chatting, and bizarrely, I told them a story about an infidelity which was completely made-up. On the way back to the table, I felt a terrible sense of stupidity and guilt. Why would I have said such a thing to these people? When I returned my partner picked up on my awkwardness and became suspicious and angry. Next I'm in a large underground leisure complex with interesting organic spaces that flow into each other organically. The walls are stone or concrete but pink in color - like a pink sandstone. It reminds me of some modern architecture I've seen in the past - perhaps inside the modern pyramid entrance to the Louvre. The leisure centre is bustling with people - mainly women, who are darting into saunas or pools or bathrooms in towels. The atmosphere is highly sexually charged.",Negative

His home was called something weird like Bertz. His street was Schub and I asked Mom where it was later and she was like ""why?"". The lady at the desk (where you had to sign out) told Calvin that she would refer us if our birthdays were in January. We told a teacher and they said she had lied. I went to the toilets and some were open. I went into a cubicle and this girl stood outside, asking if I was female. They gave me a dildo. I like ""what the hell are you giving me this for?!"".

We finally came out into a great field with a jungle in the distance. We noticed small animals resembling pigs running around. As we got into the jungle proper which was very light and sunny we saw all sort of wildlife. Lions, giraffes, pythons, standing out most in my mind. For safety we decided to climb trees.

He left her at the edge of the ditch, because when we got up, she appeared once more. She was half inside it, getting wet. I was below and shouted at her brother who was standing with his back to me, but much higher. I shouted at him to take her out.

"Paulina is sitting on a young man's lap and he points to my breasts and says to her in a cold voice, ""Do you want these?"" Paulina looks at me and then at him and he repeats the question, contemptuously. She isn't particularly interested, but the feeling is that she is beginning to realize she's a lesbian. Then the man says, ""You disgust me,"" in harsh tones and points to my breast. I look and realize it is hanging out of my swim suit and is old, shrunken, with a nasty rash on it. I am embarrassed and shamed. I tuck it back in saying, ""I need a new swim suit."" Now, I am in bed with Howard and another woman. I am in the middle. We are all sleeping. It is late at night after a party and in his dorm room. We are naked. I sleep pointed toward him, laying on my stomach, almost like I was hinting he could approach me, but pretending I was just sleeping. He sleeps. He gets up and leaves. I turn my body so it is pointing to the sleeping woman. I feel funny about that and change my position. She leaves. I am alone and I see two college men with mop buckets and brooms open the door. They have clean-up duty in the dorm, and when they see me they quickly close the door. I continue to lie there. I know that they are plotting to come in and rape me because if I am naked in the bed in a men's dorm, I must be a loose woman and up for grabs. They come back in grinning broadly and evilly, pretending to mop and clean. I pick up the small, old-fashioned black phone and dial 911, just in case. Ethan's voice comes on the line announcing some place of business. I put my finger on the phone to break the connection but talk like I'm calling 911. The men decide to leave. I quickly get up, finding my bra on the side table. I look in the mirror and see I'm still dressed, except I don't have my bra on. so I carry it. I go into the small bathroom to brush my teeth with Howard's brush and use Howard's hair pick. My hair is wet like I'd showered and I pick at it to try and dry it some. I'm in a hurry and anxious. I hear little boys singing outside the window, ""Whore, whore, whore."" I see the wooden shutter is partly open and I try to hook the eye hook lock on both sides. It is hard. Then I leave.

Chicken and spaghetti are the only two things I remember specifically, but there was much more. I had Just started to eat when I got up to get something for another girl. When I returned the waitress had taken my plate. I was very angry that the other girls hadn't prevented this, but was able to get more food. There was more to the dream but I can't remember it. Interpretation I can think of no explanation Answers to questions 2. Angry3. Actual participant4. Unpleasant5. Dining room6. No7. It seems that the sauce on the spaghetti looked red, but I have no clear picture of this, and it might seem this way because I know spaghetti would have had that color.",Negative
"I'm in a store looking at all the things. I see small dolls who are in wheel chairs. They are sort of Poster Kids all dressed up in pretty dresses as they are part of a choir that performs. I pick up one, a girl in a pink dress and in a manual chair. She is sort of alive. I put her back. I look at a picture of their choir director, a man with a motorcycle and brace on one leg and an amputated stump on the other. I go on looking at other things in the store. [BL]",Positive
"Performing Hotel California  I'm going to a concert with two others to perform. We are practicing the song ""Hotel California"" on drums. We are going to improvise in the concert. It seems we're on the Thru Highway in Wilmerton near Armstrong High School heading towards my ex-girlfriend Annie's house. This is a big concert with many performers. I walk down some very steep stairs to get there. Parents and friends of other performers are walking there too. There is soda spilled on some steps, and I warn people to watch out for this. In the room where people prepare their act are my friends Melanie McDyss, Kevin Simpson, Carmen Allure, and others. My classmate Tom Dement is there, later. Kevin does a skit that ends with a big piece of artificial feces. I laugh out loud from my place on the side of the stage. It is like the Talent Show at Armstrong High School.",Negative

I was sitting at my pc in my home office eating a muffin and I had a full glass of milk sitting to my right. I had taken the paper off of the muffin but the muffin was still sitting in the middle of it. I was breaking pieces off with my fingers and eating it that way.

"I am directing an open air play/movie. It's a rocky terrain and yet it's in a building. There is a high wall with very high windows like in a gym. Bright sun is beaming through the windows and I ask someone to go block it. Someone puts an Indian blanket over the window, but it doesn't help. Someone says the kleig lights were left on. I stop the actors and say, ""Let's take a look at the rooms and layout so we know where to move."" I draw a square on a blackboard and label one the living room. Then I say you know, like the ""salon."" Then I'm watching the actors and I stop them and say, ""You don't have to shout. Here, let me show you."" I run over and do Mark's lines as he watches. I walk up a few rocky steps toward the female actor and say softly, ""Let me press your hand one more time."" Then I change the line to, ""Let me take your hand one more time.""

"At one time I was discussing vagus inhibition. Presently I was out in the gray of a wet morning, walking the deserted streets of Newtonville with most disconsolate feelings. I came to our house and seated myself on the piazza. By and by the C quartet seemed to have planned a sea trip. We were to take a train at 8:10. I reckoned that this would be an express and get us to the wharf by nine. Then I remembered it was winter. I fell in with L. near the old corner bookstore at night. We started toward the north end, but finding we were leaving all lights behind, we faced around and decided to go to a theater. I do not remember reaching one. Shortly it was day again. I came to the brow of a precipice and concluded to jump off. I was a little uncertain as to the result, but thought I could do it well enough. And so it proved. Clearing an iron railing, I sailed down easily to a jutting point thirty feet below, landed lightly and leaped off again. Three or four such stages placed me at the foot of the cliff.",Negative

"I had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad night because Mom wasn't there; she was out with Uncle Larry. But people were still fussing around. Aunt Christine was at the kitchen table, putting packing tape and newspapers in a box, so you can imagine what that sounded like. And then there was all kinds of other stuff going on. And while all that was going on, I kind of fell asleep for maybe ten minutes and I had a dream that Aunt Christine and Mom were going to drive me over to Grandma's house so that I could find a place to sleep. And so we got in her truck and we were driving, and we got there and it was turned into like a store. There were like racks of stuff there and her old carpet and things were still there, but it was all opened up and there was like this store and they were like selling like tourist gifts. And Grammy was there and she was like directing people around, and, of course, fussing like her usual self does. And there were no bedrooms there any more. And I think suddenly I was home in my room, and I had a feeling that it wasn't really real, but I went up to my bed and I laid down and I turned on my unit that's by my bed there, and it was so quiet that I had to bring it onto the bed next to me and like lay there and just it was okay. And I'm imagining this, but I just had the feeling that it wasn't real, that none of this was real. And so then I knew I had to get back to Aunt Christine's house, but I don't know what, even though I was kind of going to sleep in my dream, I had to get back to Aunt Christine's house.

"Laura and I are at Kelly's place. We're working down on the road with a bunch of religious people. Kelly tells us to go to their bagel bakery. The baker, Que Cho (ficticious person), will give us each a bagel. Que Cho looks like he was a professional hit man before he turned to bagel baking. His skin is sompletely pockmarked and scarred, and his nose has definitely been broken more than once. Que Cho gives us each a bagel. We go back to the road. At 2 o'clock I hear somebody ask How much longer will it be until 'Jesus Hour'? Fifteen minutes, the other replies. I run back up to the house and find Laura in Kelly's room. ""Kelly!"" I say.

""I had to learn a bunch of songs for today's Jesus Hour, so I can't really skip out.""  They ring the bell and Laura and I go to hide in the closet. When everyone's gone, we go back to the bakery. We ask for another free bagel, and Que Cho gives it to us, but it's pretty clear that we're *really* pushing our luck with this guy. We get out as fast as we can.

Then I go down another hall and find a catalog of classes. It has a small pamphlet with insert pages in it, on brown recycled paper. Very cheaply done. But economical. I realize I've chosen to take a general psychology class and wonder if this will have the right kind of information in it. I begin to doubt my decision to return to school. Jake is around somewhere. I go out to find my van. It is parked on the street.

There was a reunion at my high school just before finals. It was announced that alumni would be allowed to take the high school finals as practice for their own finals. This was explained to me and a friend of mine by two female students who were in my high school graduating class. We were standing by the men's room near my home room.

I only knew a few things that I had to do, and so I'm trying to manage this big dog and keep him under control, and get in this bus and this train. And then I switched to another scene suddenly where we were in a hotel room with Mom and Dad and these two strange girls, and it was a really small, like one-bedroom room, like they are. And the carpets were red, and the walls were kind of bleah, yellowy. And we were playing this game with like a bunch of letters and little design things that you were supposed to pull out of a box and make words. And whatever the words said you had to do. And Dad wasn't really playing the game. He was laying down in front of the bed, so whenever we were walking around, we had to step over him. And I was remembering how I was putting my personal stuff under the bed because I didn't want the two strange girls messing it up. And I don't remember too much about what words we were making in the game, but one of the girls like laid near my stomach and sat on my back and like waved a paint brush between my legs, and I was so scared because I couldn't kick; I couldn't get her off of me and I was afraid of what she was going to do to me. And, let's see, was there anything else? I don't think so. That was all there was.",Negative

Someone is sitting on a crumpled up blanket on my left, and Melanie is on my right. Melanie is naked, and sits with her legs bent, knees up towards her chest, and her arms folded across her chest. I see the top of her breasts. She is leaning up against me pressing really hard, flirting. I feel awkward: not sure of how I should react to this. Then I realize Melanie is drunk! She giggles as I say this to her: she is very flirtatious. My housemate Stephen and I and another man poke fun at Melanie for being drunk. We dance around her in a triangle.

I was talking to Richard Nixon about something, on the living room side of the dining room table.  Then I saw a mouse run across the floor, and then another in a different direction-a big black one.  They were almost as big as rats, but I considered them mice.  I asked someone if there was a gun in the house so that I could shoot them.

"Laura and I are half-buried in the mud at the bottom of the train tunnel, laying down and hiding out. We were hiding there, I explained, for the same reasons the bums hung out at the opening end every morning -- it was a hell of a lot warmer than any other place at that time of day, due to the draft. Suddenly they built a train station around us. It would take you to New York City. It was all shiny and modern-looking, and Laura and I did go to New York. I considered how close New York was all along, and wondered why we never went. We came back and I went to work at the Green City Library with Larry. That woman Patti was at the desk. At closing time, a woman walked in and Patti refused to help her. ""We're closed. Sorry. That's all. We're closed."" Then she started *doing her makeup* and putting on jewelry. That annoyed me a lot. She refused to help someone at one minute to closing because she wanted to put on makeup? Larry walked with me across the wierd hills to the train station and explained how he could take my job on Mondays since I didn't like it on that day. And I was going anyway.

Instead I shoot him several times in the chest. It seems to be make-believe shooting: lines of orange-yellow pellets come out of the gun. He is not dead or injured. He chases me with a knife. We fight. I hit him with my gun. At one point I think I should just let him kill me because I will not die. He didn't die when I shot him, so I'll be fine.",Negative

The other was clear translucent mesh with black feathers around the top. I meant to try them on but I forgot. Dirty plates and congealed gravy were left on the dining room table. My mother said, ""Rudy's just got back from this job interview. Merri, make some gravy with this water. Jesus could turn this gravy into wine.""

My car was out the front near the road. This guy had a gun and I ignored it and got into my car. He came over and I locked my door and started the car and left. Then I was being chased by the cops and others. I drove to some hard to find building and went in looking for someone.,Negative
This girl and I were at home. People from House of 1000 Corpses were coming to take us. She wandered off and I saw her getting taken into Ezra's bookcase. I went to save her and got taken too. Everyone was at this place. I found Calvin and saw these people who looked like Chinese peasants and they had those pointy hats. I started doing stuff at this hospital. There was a time machine and I gave files to the boss' wife. He came and said that 'E' was missing and she came with all the files. He was angry.,Negative
"I was having kind of an odd dream last night, although it wasn't really all that odd, considering everything that's been going on in my life. I dreamt that I was in a hotel room and I was at an audio work station with a computer screen kind of far away, and there was a typing keyboard and there was a musical piano keyboard.

"I was reading apache bellyache will be traveling. That is all I read when I awoke. Carl Fisher and I were surrounded by a gang of gangsters of Mexican bandits and we were getting captured and marched into a big hall. Guns were taken and there was only one way I saw to escape. I started to fly and one of the bandits gave me a shove, which gave me a good start. I flew to close windows and then I flew back to the doors and I escaped. Fisher in the surprise of me also escaped. We were crossing a field where there were cows and one cow started to charge us. We started to run for the fence in flight. Fisher said, ""Shoot your gun."" I said, ""I have no gun,"" but I put my hand into my pocket and felt a small gun. We got under the wire, then walked over where the bandits were in the big hall. They were inside, afraid of us. We had our two guns. People were going in and out of the hall and they gave us respect.",Negative
I was on an assault boat in a beach landing and we were lowering a small boat over the side of the landing craft.

"I had agreed to pick up a friend (Nelly) after work. When I was coming close to the building (which was on the corner of some big avenue), I met another friend (Martha), and I thought that she had also agreed to pick up Nelly, and she told me that she hadn't seen her. We both went in and in the lobby I found a cousin and his sister who came over later on (I was alone). I was happy to meet them, even though they left afterwards, and then I continued my search. Many employees had already come down, but she hadn't. I got to a floor where the offices were modern (without exaggerations) and cozy. I looked at a girl (whom I don't know very well) who seemed to work there. I was like looking for something, and she did not see me when I went into another area. At that point Nelly and Martha appeared from some door, talking enthusiastically, and we went down together. The lobbies at the office had interesting magazines and pamphlets. One of them advertised a well-known resort, but the name was misspelled (from the point of view of phonetics). Nelly is usually not punctual in what she does and one can never have any confidence in her. That is why I didn't look for her with a lot of enthusiasm. But in spite of everything, I wanted to comply with her, looking perhaps to have this returned some day in the same way.",Positive
"I was in college again. It was summer and instead of enjoying the beach, or sitting outside reading or going for a walk, I was stuck in a hot un-airconditioned classroom. We were reading Shakespeare and my books on tape hadn't come. I had a small tape recorder with a built in mic in my hand and the tape was moving, I could hear the motor and feel it moving. We were all yawning because it was so hot and the professor never came and so we left. I walked out of the classroom, into a hall and outside into the warm sunlight.",Negative

I decide I must clean up before the wife hears me, and look around for a sponge to soak up and rinse into basin. Then I see a long, probably 14-inch turd, mine, on the floor near the bowl.

It has the words ""Howard's Place"" printed on it in white ink. Now I can't get the kitchen faucets to close down no matter how I turn them. I finally ask Howard how to do it. He is in the bathroom showering and I knock on the door. He calls out how. I do it. Then I go into another kitchen; more mess. I sigh. I must have not done a thing for a long time.

"In the dream I live in a scruffy city which is similar to London - possibly the East End. There are large railway arches and tower blocks. But the place seems to be filled with public art. At the end of every public corridor there's an abstract painting and at the end of a tunnel there's a large construction of some conceptual kind. I'm in an expensive restaurant with my partner, who is in a bad mood. We are sitting in an empty room apart from one other occupied table - it feels as if the restaurant is closed to the public. On the other table sit four art critics (although they also might be artists or politicians). Their table is covered by a white cloth.

Its leaves are like tentacles reaching out to try and grab me, to kill me. I had been lazy and irresponsible when I buried the stuff there. I run madly and it grows very fast to try and get me. I run down a street near a parked car. The tentacles could only reach that far and it is screaming (Sounds like Godzilla) with fury and frustration that I am just out of its reach. I stand there listening to its screams and watches as it dies. I walk around the block to stay safely out of its way. Someone insists I go back and look at it now that it is dead.

"I died and was being lifted by some unseen power to heaven. Well, maybe to heaven. I'm not sure. I don't think I was afraid. As I was being lifted, I could see the world beneath me. I could see city lights and things. I had my hands folded in front of me. My biggest concern was Matthew and how difficult my death would be for him. I was thinking that at least I am headed in the right direction. I'm headed up and not down. There were several times that I prayed while I was being pulled up. It seemed to take along time to be lifted all the way up. While I was being lifted, I prayed several times, that God would comfort Matthew. I just kept asking God to help Matthew through this. I was now in a small room. All four walls were glass. It was a square room. There was room for little more than two people to sit, face-to-face. I was sitting there in a chair. I don't really know how I got in there. Jesus came in and went back out to find another folding chair. Then he came back in and sat with me. He was holding my hands. I asked him to be with Matthew. He said that they had arranged for him to spend time with Grandpa Fr. They were going to an amusement park. We sat there and talked. He kept holding my hands. I just kept saying, repeatedly, how sorry I was that I had so much difficulty being tolerant and forgiving of some people. I told him how much I disliked that about myself and how much I wish I could have done better, how hard it was, how sorry I was. Then I realized that I was going to be sent back - that I wouldn't remember any of it. I kept wondering if I could will myself to remember any of it. I didn't think that would be the case.

Knowing full well that unless someone warns the people coming up from the blind curve that there will be more wreckage strewn along the road. Just as I started down the road the state cops came along. Evidently they had been following the speeder. A police helicopter hovering overhead ordered ambulances and other police to the scene. Most of the people I slowed down swore at me first until they learned what had happened. From the screech of tires, everyone was going too fast for the curve. There was also a bridge just after the curve. There was a lot of damage and quite a few people injured. The police drew a diagram of the scene of the accident to have us furnish proof of what happened. The three boys in the car that caused the accident were all young.

"I and some other family members were at BJ's house, though it looked different than it does in waking life. I was in the house with some of the others and was looking out the window. BJ was in her car. It was a very old, large, red car. She was going somewhere. I noticed parts falling off from under the body of the car. I was thinking how dangerous the car is and said this to someone. I went outside and she had gotten out of the car and came back to the house. I said something to her about needing to replace the car and she agreed. Bill F was standing there. Now it seems that the car belonged to Bill F. We started talking about him donating the car. We went back into the house. Now the car was a flowering plant. It was in a very large, round planter. I was thinking that it was odd that as much as I like flowers and plants I didn't especially care for this one. I was studying it and began to think that I could really learn to appreciate and enjoy it. As I was doing this Bill F had a hand spade and was digging up the plant. It seemed to be several separate plants in the one planter. He was digging them up and separating out the individual plants. Someone asked the name of it. They said it was some kind of orchid. It didn't look like an orchid does in waking life. I can't remember the name now but at the time I thought it was such a beautiful name and it gave me a new appreciation of it. It's as though it changed how I felt about something else - feeling more joy. It was covered with small pink flowers with white and yellow on the inner part of each flower. Each flower had about four petals.",Positive

Immediately several people surround her and help her up. I call for an ambulance. About a minute later, an ambulance man walks up the road with a clipboard, and starts asking questions and marking the answers in marker pen on a wipe-clean questionnaire on his clipboard. It seems to me that this isn't a real medical person, but a crazy man with a bizarre and macabre hobby. I leave the scene and go to the hospital to report him. It turns out I was wrong - he was real - which is very bizarre. Why was he asking questions and not getting the woman to hospital?",Negative
"The dream started out with this Negro maid, this old woman who had a daughter who was in the hospital because she had had an abortion. The daughter had been having this affair with this white man and she thought he was in love with her, but he had never given her any money or help when she was in the hospital or anything, and never acted particularly nice toward her. So we were trying to persuade her that he wasn't the type of person to be with and for her to try to just forget about him and find somebody else and get married. We were also looking fro this person, this man. I had seen him one time and I was going to point him out to somebody else who was with me. I never got a chance to do it. We were in this big restaurant sort of place and there was such a complicating thing. There was a postcard. It was a picture of an elephant which was covered with these strange little insects, and underneath its skin was sot of red and blue. I was telling this person, I believe it was my mother, who I was going to show this man if ever came around, that this was the kind of shirt he had on. We were sitting in this restaurant, waiting in this booth to see if this man would come down. There were a lot of people walking around us and two boys that I used to know from high school were seated across from us. As we sat there, all of a sudden there was this big something. Anyhow we all got thrown around against the table and everything and it was an earthquake. Everybody was standing up. I don't know exactly why we were all standing up to see if it would happen again or not. There was sort of this big tension. Then filing up the stairs in this slow terrible walk came this group of convicts. Apparently there was a prison in the basement, and for some reason, I guess the guards thought the prisoners would be safer upstairs, they were bringing them up. Some of them didn't look particularly different from anybody else. They didn't have a distinctive uniform, although they were dressed in sort of a strange way that set them apart. A lot of them maybe looked leathery looking. Their skin was sort of an odd consistency and they looked very strange. They went on upstairs. Then I got sort of involved with the story of these convicts and I couldn't, I don't know exactly what happened, but I was reading or somebody was telling me the fact that once a year they could give a play that had three characters in it if somebody in the place had written one. And somebody had this year. It was a terrible play. It was written in this flamboyant verse and it had three characters in it, two women and a man, but it was a horrible play. It was funny because it was in this outlandish verse and sort of old-fashioned in that respect and yet it was sort of an expressionistic play too. It was sort of an odd combination.",Negative
"I and some family members were standing outside a home. I was standing outside a car. I think Aunt P and Aunt H were in the car. Someone was shooting at me. I think there may have been other family members in the car as well. I think later in the same dream we were in the house. Maybe it was a Harris reunion. A lot of people were spending the night. I'm not sure where we were. I think we were at my house. Alan K and Jean K were going to share my bed. Jean K was going to sleep in the middle. At one point I woke up in the dream and - that was when I woke up from this dream where someone had been shooting at me. When I woke up Jean K was awake. I said something to her. She was telling me that she had just had a dream in which either someone was shooting at me or she was shooting at me. I said, Oh. You've got to be kidding. I just had a dream that you were in that someone was shooting at me and that Aunt P and Aunt H were in the car I think. There was also something about Linda W and Dick W but I don't know what. We were going back to sleep but now Alan K was sleeping in the middle instead of Jean K. I was trying to get comfortable. They had moved so that I was right on the edge of the bed. I moved as much as I could but finally told them that I was about to fall off the edge of the bed. Jean K said to Alan K, Alan K. She's about to fall off the edge of the bed. But they didn't move. I tried to push against them to get them to move but they still wouldn't. I think Jean K got up now. I pushed against Alan K again and said, You have got to move over! I think he finally did move over. Then Larry K came in. He was alone. He was talking to us a little bit. He took his shirt off and was going to get in bed with us. I said, Oh no. I am not sleeping between the two of you. I'll get squished. Larry still got in bed on the other side of me. I said, I guess I'll sleep on top of the two of you because I'm not sleeping between you. So I was lying kind of on top of the two of them. They were both lying on their left sides. I think I was mostly lying on Larry K's back. I was noticing how much hair they both had on their backs. I usually think that is kind of gross but for some reason theirs didn't bother me that much. Maybe because it was lighter or not that thick. It was kind of curly. There was something about when Jean K told me she had that dream about it being the third time.",Negative

"I was driving in a car, I guess my car, though I'm not sure, down Grand Avenue in the Grove, towards S. Bayshore, and I drove by Florida Pharmacy. I stopped and I went inside. I was a stranger in town. I had just come to this town, when I first walked into the pharmacy. The inside looked somewhat different than it actually looks. Actually let's see, there were pinball machines, I think, in the back, and there were some guys standing around that looked like hoods, but they were young, perhaps 18 or 19. So I walked to the back, walked by them, and I was expecting perhaps they would start a fight or something. It was that type of atmosphere, that I was a stranger in town and here were the young hoodlums by the pinball machines, but they just looked me over. They didn't say anything. I walked by them. Then all of a sudden I had a locker there for some reason. Now in the dream evidently, it wasn't bizarre at the time or peculiar, but evidently I had been in town for at least a while because I had a locker there. Inside the locker was a large manila envelope. One of the things I had inside was a razor. I was going into the bathroom to put on lather and shave myself. So I went in and put on the lather and began to shave myself, and I heard someone calling from the outside. I went out, still with lather on my face. In fact, I was still shaving without a mirror. There was a girl there, my girlfriend, though in this dream she was perhaps a causal acquaintance, perhaps a light affair or something, as though I had been in town a few days and met this girl. Then it's very hard to explain, but the manager of the store said something like, ""Hey, we're going to get you because your summons disappeared."" I was thinking in the dream something about the fact that I had been framed because although I had received some kind of ticket, I got another notice saying it had been repealed, and I didn't have to appear in court, or something to that effect. But the man said, ""No, you were supposed to appear and you didn't and now you're going to jail. I'm calling the police.""

The speaker wants the walking man to falsify kissing and sexual acts. To appease the speaker, the walking man pretends to kiss him, but doesn't ever kiss him on the lips. This seems to be to demonstrate a purpose, for the public, to encourage or advertise somehow. There is a young Asian man and a woman there. The man seems to have just awakened, and the woman comments that he didn't put his hands in his pants nearly as much as she thought he would. At one point, the Asian man tells the woman to stop touching/arousing him because he'll get an erection. There is another white couple there.",Positive
"I was dressed as a bride. I was wearing a long and white dress, whose train was so long it almost reached the cathedral's door. I was getting married, but I was crying and telling my mother that I didn't want to get married because, being married, I couldn't go to school or feel at home with my friends. My mother was trying to calm me down, saying, ""No, darling, you're still going to see your friends,"" but I said, ""I won't be able to go to school; I want to study."" As the ceremony went on, I kept crying and trying to see the face of the man I was marrying, but I couldn't see past his shoulders, even when I made an effort; I couldn't see his face. He had a black dinner jacket on, white shirt and a small bow tie. In the church there were many elegantly dressed people. My mother was trying to encourage me to get married so that I wouldn't stand up the bridegroom. At that moment I woke up, almost crying. The cathedral where the wedding was taking place was familiar to me.",Negative
"The dream is about a party I had last night. I remember I was at the party with a classmate. I saw him, a boy of 17 years, and his cousin, 19 years, who always danced with me. I also saw the boy's house just as it really is. A hallway which is at the entrance was dark and I think the walls were painted green and the floor in red. There I was with my classmate's cousin. In the dream I was very happy, really having fun. I also saw myself dancing with all the boys who were attending the party. I saw my classmates who went to the party. They were playing fast music and the atmosphere was very gay; everybody seemed very happy.",Positive
"We seemed to have an atom or hydrogen bomb dropped on us. We were exposed to it, but we laid down for a while, then came to and moved around, the strongest of us. I started to fly around, then there seemed as though a hurricane came. It was blowing down everything. I saw a large spider close and it seemed to be blowing with sparks of fire, but I seemed to be mighty, but it didn't seem to bother me. It didn't seem to move me. I was standing on a small bridge looking into a small brook in the shore. I saw a green snake, then a larger one, and about 10 snakes, each one larger than the other one. The largest one was about three inches in diameter. I put my stick near him and he bit at it.",Positive
"We were at school, except it was really weird. There were beds and stuff, and we weren't really doing any work. Judy and Michael (classmates) were there. Judy was in her nightgown and she didn't have any underwear on. It was the end of the day. And my grandma was supposed to pick me up. I waited and waited, and she didn't come. And then this was very scary. I was catching a bus. I went on this bus. It looked like a real bus. It was wonderful. It was really weird. I don't know what happened. Bob was in my dream. I didn't go where I was supposed to go on the bus. I felt frustrated about the bus.",Negative

I was doing some kind of computer work. internet work. It had something to do with directory work. There was a problem that I was trying to fix.

"There was one day to go back to Cuba. I wasn't (going), but Americans mostly came back alive. In the huge sand-covered arena mothers were crying. Their children were tortured and killed and you could never tell when your number was up. I went back to USA and my friend from Cuba had to go. She borrowed my car to get there and was worried about how the girl's mother packed her lunch. Since chances were she wouldn't come back, we were worried about finding her--or finding the car floating in the river. Bad things were happening. ??? My friend made it back from the torture with her hair dyed blonde and she was looking extra perky. She looked so American. You would never guess her for one of them. I was working in advertising. That very day I was going in to Cliff Freeman's group. And one guy was extra flashy. He was telling me to lock doors and go back and check them. The Cuban girl got back just in time for the train ride. Doctor Allen was sick and he was in a hotel so he could get some rest . He wanted me to reserve a room for Mrs. Allen so she could rest, but that was OK cause Mrs. Allen didn't feel like looking after him. On the train we took the last 2 seats. We went right by an amusement park and I later we could see it in the distance--on the horizon over a mountain. Pieces of paper were on the floor at angles. They were soaking with paint, green paint. We were in a speed boat. Rudy was holding a fishing line in his hand, no pole or rod and reel, and we were slicing through the waves. He kept latching on to a tiny baby fish. This is what he wanted.",Negative
"I dreamt about going to buy books for school...at the observatory?  There were a lot of people there, and it was large, so I started to get lost. I went in the back to get some sort of sweet raisin bread.  Then there were a bunch of rats, and I felt like I was being conned, and I couldn't trust them.  On the way home, I was confused.  I drove partway looking at a map. I stopped where some man lived, and my father was there.",Negative
"Shooting Electrons  I'm at a swimming pool. There is a long and thin device that floats on the surface of the pool. I jump in the pool, catching the device as I submerge, and dragging part of it under water. I swim underwater, collecting the ribbon-like floating device as I float up. The device may be a NADH molecule. I shoot electrons at my neighbors Gary and Wilma Stein who are on the deck of the pool. The electrons are part of the floatation device that I have gathered in my arms. I emerge from the surface and throw the electrons at them, and then swim down and away. My brother Wally is there. I swim away, coming up for air like a dolphin or a fish jumping, and then go back down. Gary and Wilma are throwing something at me. I dive down in the aqua pool water. There is a scale of depth. I go 14-20 feet down. There is a beer cap on the bottom of the pool. The top of the cap is facing down.",Negative
"It was a dark, stormy night and I had been out walking. I walked and walked all over town, then came back to my street. I couldn't find my home at all. It wasn't where it should have been. I hunted up and down the street and all over the block and still couldn't find it. I asked the people who were home (neighbors) if they had seen my house. They looked for it too, but they couldn't find it. I went to my grandmother's place and she took me in for a week until I could find the house. I woke up when I was looking for my house again.",Negative
"I am Queen Mary. I have a woman secretary. I have a dream. The dream has a small image. It says, ""Mary dances 28 times and draws a picture of a lounge area, a chair, 4 chairs around a table, with a napkin holder in the center, and a padded bar."" I tell my dream to my secretary. She tells me about a person she knows who would like to take me out for a cup of coffee. As she is talking, I see a man in a green suit peeking around the corner. He then moves to sit near her. He says, ""I hope you don't mind but I'm the one who would like to take you out for a cup of coffee."" I smile at his naivete. I say, ""My dear boy, where do you suppose the Queen of England could go for a casual cup of coffee? I would have to have at least 10 persons within visual contact of my body."" He says, ""Oh, I didn't think of that."" I chuckle softly. He goes away. I then continue to work through the dream. I see a small printed box. I read the words. They are clear details from the dream. I read them to my secretary. ""Frank G. Sinatra, Cary Grant,"" and a long list of other names. ""Oh! Ingrid Bergman is listed as with Cary Grant."" The secretary and I are very impressed with the clarity of the dream stuff. Then suddenly, I get an inspiration. I say, ""Don't you see? Frank Sinatra, to the lounge, to your nephew wanting to take me out for coffee, to the sense of a James Bond movie I woke up feeling! It all fits."" The secretary becomes upset. ""Oh! My nephew,"" she says. ""Does that mean you suspect him?"" I nod yes and I suddenly realize that it goes one step further and links up with the secretary. She then realizes it and we look at each other, concerned, confused, and embarrassed. (Oh, I remember that when I read the list of stars and who was with them, me secretary said, ""But how could you know that?"" I said, ""I didn't, not on a conscious level, but I must have heard it or read it sometime, everything goes into the unconscious and comes back up when it's needed."" I felt very impressed at the workings of the unconscious mind).",Negative
"Jasmine was running a photo group. There was a large group of kids. Mostly college age. We would go back and forth from my father's station to shoot. There were aluminum lounge chairs. There were pedestals. We would shoot and go back to the restaurant to work out our shifts. We could leave from the station. We were on my father's boat. Another boat was tied to it. We would drive back to the station in the boat. When I was driving I couldn't see. I was going fast. And suddenly lights appeared from the boat and I saw a traffic island with parked cars and trees in the middles of the lake. I went up in the air and ran into a tree house. There were kittens there. Little kittens. Just learning to walk. They lived on the second boat but when it filled with water they came to the main boat. We were taking pictures. A guy from the photo group, as we were going in a line around in circles, touched my neck gently and breathed on it. It sent shivers up my spine. He said, ""Should we go back to my room to sleep?"" and I said, ""My neck is just very ticklish."" Another guy went to make a drug buy. He was buying dope but called it another name. He and another guy went down an alley to make the buy. Cop cars appeared. I thought they'd been busted. An old lady had her pink glasses knocked off. They were shattered. She was sitting on the floor picking up the pieces of her glasses. She had a pink matching necklace that had been her mother's. It was intact. The cops put an old black man in handcuffs. They had not seen the drug deal. In the car the guys were driving and trying to do the dope. They didn't know how to open the bag efficiently. They passed it up to me and I was trying to do some but the dope came out in clumps. We were driving. I said, ""What you guys need is a plate and a razor blade to cut this stuff up with."" They did not understand. Cop lights came on following us. I picked the dope flakes off my sweater and ate them so when the cops came it would be gone. I doubted if I'd feel anything this way. We were going back. Jasmine was there. The kids were getting ready for the big prom. I went to use the computer we took turns, starting at 10:00 p.m.",Negative
"I dreamed that my home was a huge mansion, composed of five floors. My room was on the third floor, and was very small. I remember seeing that everything in it was pink, and it seemed to be long and very narrow. In the dream I found that my sister had a room on the fourth floor which was very huge and done up completely in green. I walked from room to room on the fourth floor, and found that many of my old friends were living in them. Who these friends were is a bit hazy now, but they were people I knew a long time ago. I was very jealous of my sister's room, and I thought it was horribly unfair of my mother not to let me have the room. I thought she should let us alternate using the room. This much is all I can remember. Interpretation I might interpret this dream by a feeling of jealousy towards my sister, but I have never felt this way. The only explanation I can find is that I sometimes say to my folks, ""You let Marge do it when she was my age,"" in order to do something my folks dislike. Maybe this dream was my punishment! However, I definitely have no feelings of jealousy toward my sister. My room at present is done in pink, and my sister's room many years ago was in green. Why I dreamed of this or a mansion I don't know. Answers to questions 2. I felt perplexed, jealous, and a little angry.3. Actual participant4. Unpleasant5. My entire home (supposedly) but mainly my and my sister's bedrooms.6. No7. Yes, green and pink.",Positive
"Am in the UN building and I see an inside window display or type of showcase in which there is a card saying something about an exhibit on mankind. Focal point is a tall male mannequin or store dummy dressed in mod clothes: tight gray trousers and shiny long leather boots. The model is exact copy of myself and I realize this was done on purpose. Sort of growing out of one part of the dummy is another head, closely resembling me also. But it is decidedly a feminine head. Exhibit includes statuary of some modern shape, plus photos that I cannot distinguish. A woman approaches me as I am looking at exhibit. She is somewhat mannish, but otherwise attractive, and she says she is Mme. Onantis, the photographer of the exhibit. (It's a name I have never heard before.) I tell her how much I like her work and then we walk out of building. Altho sun is shining, it suddenly rains and we decide to wait under the sheltered doorway.",Negative

It seems that all the flowers started to sink and go under. The red lily-like flower began to fall apart. The instructor came in and said not to bother, but I wanted to make the flowers look better.

It hangs sideways and has a round earpiece and the mouthpiece is sort of the end of the metal rod that you hold. You can't prop it on your shoulder. Mom's not here. Somebody else comes in, a boy (we're all young here) with some clay figures to show us. He takes them out of plastic bags. He hands me a sort of rabbit-lady, and I quite like it, but it's still a bit soft and some of it comes apart in my hand. I'm afraid if I grasp it with my other hand I'll smush it. Or if I put it down. I feel terribly responsible for it. Nobody else is paying attention yet, he's showing others to my brother and I'm sitting there, very uncomfortable, and I would really like to get up and go do something else. Finally I get tired of waiting and I put it down. It does bend a bit but it's ok.",Negative
"I got my own house which was small, but had a big yard -- it was just a big square area fenced in. There wasn't much grass, but lots of dark sand. We went to this shop with traffic lights. You had to get one item at a time, so I went through and people were moving so slowly and I rang a guy to complain and got a pack of something. I went home and went back later and it was heaps faster. Mom came over and she was like 'the yard would be good for Rover'. Ezra drove a tractor thing. The sand was poison and I wasn't able to get rid of it.",Positive
"All is set. On top of the shanty I was pushing a new kind of toy car. It was to run indefinitely. There were two of them. They would get stuck in the weeds and I would have to give them a lift out of the weeds. Then they would go. A lady was loading a bag with milk bottles and head lettuce and the bag broke. A blonde lady sat on a stable top with little Bobby and a different small baby. I saw a picture of a shotgun shell 6 inches long. John T. shot at me with his shotgun. I ran for cover and saw someone moving in the tall weeds, so I shot over his head.",Negative
"As we entered the church, C. H. asked where I wanted to sit. I indicated a pew two-thirds down at the side. She went inside the three person pew but he hadn't come yet. I went to the door to wait for him. Then I couldn't locate her. I sat on a chair at the side of the pews. Thought maybe he didn't know the way. A woman came to an empty seat in a rear pew and began to talk. Then a bus loaded with children came to the far side of the church. Then the building was empty. We were swimming. I swam to her when the water was clear blue with whitecaps at the side. It was shallow touching rough bottom; at last I walked out by a sidewalk leading to autos.",Positive
"I was at Monticello in Charlottesville, Virginia visiting Thomas Jefferson's house which I had already seen. I was down in the basement looking at all the clocks, a big clock that he had made. It has cannon balls on it. I guess my husband was with me. He and I were visiting and getting our own, personal tour of Monticello. We went there in 1989 with a bunch of people, but in this dream we were getting our own private tour. Going all over the mansion, up and down that winding staircase, in those rooms, looking at all the books that Jefferson had.",Positive

In the home of a powerful woman who was like an evil stepmother to me. Frightening mystery. Suddenly this ""step- mother"" is gone. There is a message on the answering machine. Then I go to a roof terrace where I see the stepmother and her daughter. They are both much younger. Stepmother is fifty, her daughter thirty. They look very pasty and frightening. I know that they are ghosts. I scream. They come up to me dressed in red. I don't believe that they are real, but they frighten the hell out of me. I touch the stepmother and my hand goes right through.",Negative
"Fishing Life  I'm in the Big Resort Area. I go into my room. It is big, I think very big for two people. I realize more than two people are living here. There is a toilet on the ground floor in the open. The room has a loft, where I think four people will live. I meet my roommates. One is named Matt. He is a larger man in his mid twenties. My friends Niles and Tim Zelling are my roommates too. I meet some of the other employees. They are older than I, and larger. Mike looks different than I pictured: taller and scruffier. There is a lake nearby. One guy starts up a boat with a motor and makes a small circle before docking again. Someone seems to control the boat from shore. The controller seems to have a mini boat next to the shore, which goes in a small circle next to shore, and also controls the movement of the larger boat. They want me to start the motorboat. The boat is like an alpine sliding cart, made of plastic. I try to start it. There is long rope connecting the sled and I with the boat. I sink in the plastic ""boat"". I get help from people that live there. There is a heavy crosswind, like being on a river. I can't grip the handle, which is like the stock of a gun. Then I grip it well and the engine starts. I'm in the plastic sled and I can't make the boat move. There are loons and a bald eagle there. There is a group of canoeists on a trip singing and playing guitar. The mosquitoes and the slugs are really bad. I am wearing a yellow rain suit when I go to start the boat. I walk in the water and don't get wet except through the collar. A man I work with is carrying a girl out of the water. I am taking the rope out. The man gets pushed under the water a bit.",Positive
"I was going somewhere to play baseball with some people.  It was out a country road, and we were walking.  We passed some guys playing ball on our left.  There were plain fields on each side of the road, and it was sunny.  We had come about 1 mile and had come to the place where we were going to play, I think.  I decided to go back and get some water.  I went home and got our old red jug and put a couple of trays of ice cubes in it, which filled it considerably.  There were also a clear plastic fork and spoon, and between them and the ice it was rather hard to get the lid on.",Positive

He was angry and didn't pick up on it. I was then climbing along a wall at night. I was trying to get into a friends house. He let me in. We were going to expose something.

"I went to school. I was in class and we had this seat thing which floated around the room. Jeremiah came in with other people, including Ms Solomon. Mr Stevenson came into the room and his name was Jumphed or something -- they all had changed a few letters in their names. Then I was driving at night. I knocked on the door of a house and it was little and in random spot, but it was Ms Solomon's. She let me in and there were locks on the windows and stuff. She was on the phone and got off and I said I was here looking for something. We heard a noise and I told her to get down and don't look at it ""pretend you're asleep"". I shut my eyes and she was like 'it's so long' and I realized she had looked and I was like 'damn it!'. It broke in and I ran to my car. Calvin was there now too and he had also looked. I said it looks into your eyes and sees your 'soul' -- knows what you eat and then eats you. I got in this weird buggy car and wound the windows up and rove away. I didn't know where I was though.",Negative
"We were eating dinner at-the dormitory. The menu was baked beans mixed with spaghetti, cole slaw, and rolls. The waitress was giving out extra rolls, and gave three of the girls at our table four or five extra ones, putting them in their laps. The rest of us were angered at this, for that left only a few for the rest of us. When the plate was then passed to me, I took two rolls, feeling a little guilty but rationalizing by observing that they were small. Later, one of the girls who had received the extra rolls said that she didn't know why the waitress had given her so many, and that she didn't think she could eat them. We continued to eat the rest of the meal, and just as I was chewing the last mouthful, I woke up. Also, somewhere in the course of the dream, I was telling one of the persons on the news staff of the R-- how to go about chasing stories that hadn't come in by the deadline, I told this to him in greater detail than I remember thinking it out consciously. Interpretation The part of the dream about the R-- was probably brought on because I had been worried the day before as to how I could finish everything I had to do in the next few days, including quite a bit of work on the R--. The rest of the dream is meaningless to me. Answers to questions 2. Mildly angry3. Actual participant4. Both5. Dormitory dining room6. No7. No",Negative

"I dreamt that I was out for a ride in my car. My girl and her sister were along. Betty's sister, Gladys, has a driver's license so I let her drive the car for a while. I remember that we got off the main road and were driving up and down hills on a side road. Gladys is a good driver and she wasn't breaking any laws. I remember this very distinctly. However, as we were going down one of the hills we were stopped by a police car. As we stopped I asked Gladys if she had her license with her. She said no and became rather angry. Instead of the cop coming up to me in the car, he just sat there in his and I had to go back to him. He wouldn't tell me what we had done wrong, but gave me a ticket anyway. The police car was a very odd affair, being gray, very long. As a matter of fact, it was more like a bus than a police car. After the police had driven off I began to think the situation over and it burned me up. I was about to go to the police station and demand an explanation when the dream ended.",Negative

"For a little while I was walking up a sidewalk on a road that needed mending. I remember climbing over piles of dirt and rocks. Then I was riding in a car with two boys, Leonard and John, with me in between. We were riding up a street lined by 2-story buildings. The outside wall of all the top stories was colored a brilliant deep sky blue. The sun was shining. The sky turned exactly the same deep shade of blue as the buildings so that there was blue, blue, blue all over. It was so bright and lovely that I almost cried. Next I was in a new, modern apartment on the first floor up on a hill. It had big light window sand pink decorations. When I walked in, I said, ""This needs just a touch of blue."" Then I looked around and saw at some of the little windows, flower vases, pillows, were blue. Outside was a porch, and below was a big tennis court for all the kids to play on. My brother was down there. At the time it was getting dark at twilight and I could see tiny lights in the distance.",Negative

"(02/07/98)[""The Horse Breaks a Leg""]  I am in a room. There are two or three fireplaces. There is a huge stone hearth in front of the fireplaces. A fire burns in each fireplace. As I watch, I see bits of burnt wood spark out onto the hearth. I am grateful it lands on the stone and not on the floor or the couch. I move the couch away from the fireplace. It is on a downhill slant. I don't like that. I look at the stone wall near the fireplace. It has sparkling places. I look more closely and see quartz crystals and amethyst crystals which reflect the fire. It is pretty. I look over at the other fireplace. I see smoke pouring out of it, into the room. Now I am worried about toxic smoke inhalation. I say I need a fan and then see a button on the wall. I turn it on and a fan starts up. It clears out the smoke. I then see a black device on the wall. I look more closely. It appears to be some kind of camera lens with a series of f-stops on the multiple lenses. I have no idea what it does. Now there are aliens in the room. One has a round fat tummy. I don't want him to stand so close to me that we touch. He leans forward and touches his small purple tongue to my mouth. I pull back, feeling uncomfortable. Then I look out the window. I hear some people playfully racing their horses down the street. But they are careless. One horse slips and falls badly. I feel sick when I hear him fall. I look and see that his back legs are bend. I think he's broken his legs and will have to be shot. I feel very upset  and distressed for the horse who was driven carelessly and must now pay with pain and perhaps death. The horses face is full of suffering and pain. I want to cry.",Negative
"(06/29/1997)$600 For Gabby  I'm at a gathering that is like a Teen Variety Night that I went to in junior high. A janitor stops the dance until the kids raise $600 for my boss' dog Gabby. The spirit of the crowd is reluctance at first, and then everyone starts throwing money in. I think if we divided up the money per person it would be more than five dollars each. I throw in the two one-dollar bills that are in my wallet, but not the five or 20-dollar bill. I put my one-dollar bills on a stack of money, which is ordered so that the largest bills are on the top and the smallest on the bottom. My high school classmate Tanya Simmons is there. I seem to be at Carter Elementary School. I am wearing only white briefs underwear. I walk down the north stairway, trying to look physically fit: not flabby with stretched out underwear. I go into the bathroom by Billie's Daycare. I am going to defecate. My high school classmate Mya Rousing comes into the bathroom. She says my name and tells me that she has vomited into the toilet. She says this like she needs help, like this is her weakness and she has given in to it. I sit on the toilet and fart. Mya hears this. Then I fart more quietly. I am full of gas. My high school classmates Carmen and Harmony Allure are there. Harmony has kissed a track runner from Bell College named Moab, who I think of as the track runner I know from Brimson named Paul. I come out of the stall. My high school friend Tiny Combs is there. He is naked, and facing away from me. I see his butt and butt hole. There is a pig in the bathroom. It is small and has muddy feet.

When I come to, there are other people in the room trying to comfort me. I don't recognize any of them except one person -- my daughter, Maria. They are telling me that it's OK to cry, and they're urging me to tell them what is troubling me, although they all know I am grieving for Mary. I am angry. While I don't recall the exact words of my angry outburst, the basic content of my diatribe is: ""I have to lose consciousness from my grief over losing Mary before anyone pays any attention to me and my suffering."" I believe they protest and try to assure me that they are always there, that they had always been available to listen to me and comfort me. I don't think I believe any of them.",Negative

The room becomes crowded with students. I sit down at a Macintosh computer. The teacher is a nutty man. He goes over the assignments, writing on the board what the class will do. He asks students if they would prefer the final to be a Friday or a Monday. He comes up to me and asks what I prefer.

"I'm in my apartment bedroom, with someone else (female, don't know who), while a delivery is being made somewhere and there's a truck parked outside my window. It's so big that I'm seeing the underpinnings of it or something - but it's bright daylight and the truck doesn't block the sun. My room is larger and arranged strangely, with (beds?) across the width of it, and somehow making it difficult to get to the window. The other person is standing at the window and calls to me that the kittens have gotten out the window and into the truck - that is, part of the metal stuff of the truck makes a hole that they jumped into from the windowsill. There are 3 kittens, they seem to be MB's, at least one is black and white too, the others aren't the same - one may be and white but I'm not sure. I think the other's all black. They all have names but I couldn't recall them when I was thinking about them, except one's called Trouble, I think. I'm quite upset about them getting on the truck, it might leave and they'd get hurt, or they'd fall to the ground where they are. I tell my companion to get them back and I make my way over there myself. She's got one back in already and then another and the black one falls down. Which doesn't put me in a complete panic but I'm into Emergency mode and I know I have to go get it at once, which is not all that simple under the circumstances, with the furniture in the room. (There also seems to be an opening in the floor, which makes it necessary to climb over the furniture.) I'm also terrified that MB got on the truck too and either fell down herself or will, and she'll be harder to retrieve - but as I get to the door of the bedroom, I see she's here after all. I also don't know how we're going to keep them from doing this again.

I keep my eyes closed and think I hope he can find where they are (meaning I am embarrassed that my old age has made the breasts sort of slide off to the side.) He is hesitant and then moves on. Now he kisses me. I am thinking, ""Oh oh, now what do I do?"" when I notice it is pleasant. Each step is pleasant and we end up making love. His penis is short and stubby. I stroke it with my hand and he says in a gasp, ""Are you sure you should do that? I'll only last about two minutes that way."" I smile because I realize I want it to last longer.

After I survived that one, I decide to go out away from the mountain it might be safer. As I stand on the flat plains, a wave of high water surges at us only waist high. But as I watch, the wave over the mountain had picked up huge round boulders (black). They are rushing toward us. I turn and run for my life. Someone yells get behind something. I find a rocky outcrop and crouch behind it. The boulders that would have killed me crush and break up on my shield. I decide its safer right under the mountain. I return to there.",Negative
"I drove to this restaurant thing and the first floor had collapsed, but second floor ok (no-one was on second floor). It was day time. I looked in at all the people stuck in the rubble and went back to the car. I heard giggling and a group of young people came up and said 'is Valerie in there' and I was like 'I dunno' and they said thanks for picking us up and I said I didn't and she said 'you will though' and I said 'I won't' and she said 'you will'. It was now night time and I turned on my lights. I locked my door and drove off - and saw them holding on behind. I drove crazily but it didn't knock them off. Eventually it did, but they followed and kept turning up. I was trying to find the freeway but didn't know where I was. I ended up near a hospital and called Mom and she said she was at Dad's and I said I was being stalked but she didn't have any suggestions. I got out and went into the hospital, and it was now day again. I was trying to navigate but it was difficult. There was an area underneath the hospital which had like airport shops.",Negative
Programming my car and maybe other cars to help us get where we want to go the best or most effective way. The images of the dream though were those of creating a document in MS Publisher where you can flow text from one page to the next within text boxes. When I programmed the car it affected how something flowed from page to page. I was trying again to successfully program my car so then we could use that as a guide to help other people program their cars successfully.,Positive
"I was back at _________ at Westport High School, and I was going to some English class. And I knew that there would be a fire drill scheduled in the afternoon when I was in that class, but I had some homework that I really needed to turn in, so I went to this elevator. It was this really rickety elevator that wobbled and wobbled as you went up. And I was really scared in that elevator. But I got up to the class and took out and handed in my stuff and there was a substitute teacher and I just told her __________ schedule. And I need to already be outside so that I don't get lost in the shuffle. But it was close to the time change and my clock hadn't been changed an hour later, so I kept having to adjust in my mind and I was like doubting myself. And then I finally grabbed my books and ran down the stairs a few minutes before it was supposed to be 2:30. And I think I just went up to the lawn in the front of the school and sat down, and then I woke up.",Negative
"I am a counselor at a prison. My boss is a principle. I go to his office. He's a nice enough guy. He has two knickknack shelves. One holds five pots of coffee, the coffee can being part of the pot. Each one is brewing. The other shelf has red glass vases and pitchers and pretties. It's probably his wife's stuff that there wasn't enough room at home to show. I realize he doesn't even offer me a cup of coffee, which is a good thing because I don't like coffee, but it is a bit insensitive. It's time for me to meet (written ""meat"") my two very fat counselees. I am dressed pretty, but change into glasses, a big sweater to disguise my womanness so I won't distract them. It doesn't work, of course. My course of therapy is to have them swim, and we talk about their pain. They don't open up to it easily. They are hardened criminals.",Negative

I went to Mass or some special service and I walked into church just as Father and the servers were walking to the back of the church to start Mass. I stood there for a minute and debated whether or not to go ahead of them and get a seat or wait for them to walk to the sanctuary and then follow behind them and get a seat. As they came back they headed out into the foyer so everyone started getting out of their seats and going into the foyer. I did the same. When I got into the foyer I debated whether to stop by the doors so that when we were ready to go back in I could get a seat where I wanted easier or if I should walk across to the other side of the foyer and still be one of the last ones in. That way I wouldn't risk taking the seat of someone who had been there before me. I finally decided to cross over to the far side of the foyer and be one of the last ones in.,Negative
"I was in my bedroom with a lover (no one I have ever known in actual life). There was something slightly sinister about him that made me feel uneasy, but I couldn't be sure what it was. We were doing nothing in particular, but I was very much afraid that my parents would come in the hallway and hid him in a closet. After my parents came in and spoke to me for a while, my attitude began to change. I became convinced that this lover was some sort of insect in disguise and that his intent was to injure or kill me and my family. I tried to warn my parents, but they would not believe me. Finally a huge hornet-like insect emerged from the closet and began chasing me. Then I woke up.",Negative

Myself and an older man with grayish hair and sunglasses were driving around chasing something. The car was a convertible. I'm not quite sure on the color. But I think it was dark.

"BJ was spending the night with me. I was in bed already and asleep. She had gone out for the evening and I heard her come in, lock, and chain the door. I thought that I should have given her the passcode but then didn't think anymore of it. I heard her in the office, as though she was getting ready for bed. I thought that I should get up and help her get the bed down, get her bed ready. There was a futon in there and I wasn't sure she would know how to lay the futon down. I wanted her to be comfortable so I was going to go in and lay it down for her. I called for her from bed but I don't think she heard me. So I got up and as I headed towards the office I called for her again once or twice and didn't hear a response. I said I'm calling because I don't want to frighten you. I couldn't see very well so I went back into my bedroom and got my flashlight and went back in. Then I realized she wasn't in there. She must have gone downstairs. I started straightening the office, moving some papers around and reorganizing some binders and such to make more room for her. She had laid her watch and something else on the floor so I picked them up and set them on a table where I had just made room. Just as I was about ready to lay the futon down I realized that I should just have her sleep in Matthew's room. That bed is ready and she would be more comfortable in there anyway. I was going to tell her that and I heard her downstairs talking to someone. It seems that it was someone who works for me and is always there at night. I heard that woman say that it was nice to have someone there at that time of night - someone to talk to. She was just being very friendly. She was a very large black woman.",Positive

"This was rather a disconnected dream, and I'm sure there was more to it than I can remember. However, it took place in a rather barren room, which was evidently my living quarters. I had captured a tiger (!) and kept it stuffed in a large chest. The tiger knew something which I wanted to know, so I told him I would free him if he would tell me. The tiger had the face of a man, and stood on his hind legs. The last I remember, we were in a telephone booth together making an important phone call. Interpretation I can't think of any connection to this dream. I hadn't seen any Frank Buck movies, or given any thought to tigers!

"The dream is a little involved, but it concerned a football game here at the university. It was something like watching a cartoon and some little character had gotten involved in a football game and didn't know what was going on, as things happen in cartoons. Somehow he had gotten the ball and gotten it way up on top of a flagpole. It was in the middle of the football field. At least this is where it was at the time and it was stuck up there and it wouldn't come down if he shook the flagpole or anything and the wind wouldn't blow it off. It was just sort of stuck there and it seems in some way I had been responsible for this and everybody was mad because the game was just over now. And so I was walking sort of along this dirt road close to the auditorium afterwards and this car went past with these people in it I hadn't seen for several years, a man and his wife, and they stopped and we started talking, and I told them what had happened. And now when I was pointing to the football, it wasn't on the flagpole in the middle of the stadium anymore, but on top of a big flagpole that was on top of a big water tower similar to the one that is close to the stadium here. And so we were looking up at this football and when we watched it, it started teetering back and forth and pretty soon it fell down, all the way down from the top of the water tower which was a real long way. And I was wondering if the football would burst when it hit the ground, but it didn't and so I picked it up and threw it over to one of the attendants of the team and he took it and went away. Then I went back over to where these people were and they offered to give me a ride home and I was very reluctant to take it because I knew it would be out of their way and besides I had my daughter's stroller with me. And I had been going along this sandy road and it was pretty dirty and everything. And they had just gotten this car, although it was a pretty shoddy-looking car. The girl had picked it out and she had just gone into a used car lot and gotten one that was all dented up and everything. Anyway, they said yes they would take me home and so I was opening the trunk to put the stroller in it and there was already a tear back there and this was the man's chair and he didn't want it to get scratched or hurt in any way. I finally got everything settled in there so the trunk would close because it was a very small trunk. And when the stroller was folded up, it didn't seem to fit in there very well and I closed it up and got into the car and we didn't go very far. We drove just a little bit, sort of back around a circle or something. We were out at their place or their relatives' place in the country and we had stopped there for a little while and I didn't want to do this at all, but I was stuck there. That was about all of that dream.",Negative

We jumped over to this thing on the side. A dinosaur came and it was a bigger one and it was blue. We stayed still and it jumped up to me and I quickly got onto this shelf thing. We then ran outside. Ezra and I ran to my car and got in and locked the door. I drove off and there were other people driving away and it was stressful. We went to this shop place sometime later and there was raw fish and the dinosaur things ate it. One came and I threw fish at it. Ezra packed up some and we drove away. We went to another place without the car. We cooked chicken. Two were ready and three had a few minutes left (but they had to do something else with them). Rover was there. We packed up all important stuff. There were mechanical things. We ran out and there was a robot like in World of Warcraft and it came up with the green arrow to get in. This other guy climbed up and I pushed him off. We got in a fight and something big was coming and we went the other way. At one point, I strangled some girl and pulled tight on the cord and it made a bone stick out of her neck. We had a place set up now like a village.

That is, her hobby was she liked to take pictures, both still and moving. So my dream involved her running into the house and back yard. I was looking at a package of some film she had bought. It involved the fact that she was telling me that she was ready to take her big pictures that she wanted to take for a long time, now that she had the right camera and film.

I handed her the sheep and put them against her to suckle- I was here for her help (I think I was a man and unable to suckle the sheep myself).  Elaine said they weren't suckling, and I told her that was exactly what the problem was.  Then, from a sort of sky-view, I noticed someone walking across the bridge with a leash on something in front of him.  I zoomed in to see it was Wallace (from Wallace and Gromit).  The leash was on Shaun, and there was a whole herd of sheep in front of him.  I was hopeful and went down to talk to him.

It's a little bit difficult to exactly explain the setup because the feelings that were conveyed in the dream are difficult to duplicate over tape.

"I have to write a paper for English on ""Catalogue of the Exhibition"". I had created a piece of art, we all had. We were at this sort of camp out in the middle of the forest. The entrance was a dirt road where a restaurant was. It was built into a cliff so that it was hanging over. The A-frame roof was rock with little caves containing houses (birdhouses?) in them. Anyway, at this camp, it seemed like a school trip, lots of young people. A famous artist came. She look like Mrs. S. with grey hair. She had an art exhibit. All the pieces of art were copies of ours (mine, Edies, others). She had tried to re-create our art by doing a frame by frame thing of how we made our paintings. Her work that was copying my work was in 4 pieces. One was an orangy peach shawl with long strings; one was on the wall, it was pure white with sort of indentations of flowers; another was a pair of cowboy boots; and the other was something practical(??) When I saw the show, I was pissed. She was getting tons of praise for our artwork. I rallied with some others to steal her work since it was really ours. Some liked the idea, some didn't. Me and Kathy took the shawl and the painting. But then I began to feel guilty. I went to the artists room to ask if I could have the pieces. I forget what she said but I think it was yes? for money? I'm back at home now and I have to write my paper. I decide that I will go back to the place in the forest and write about my art and Moorash's. Before I go, Sharon receives a telex from Jahn for me. She gives it to me and automatically Sharon and Diana look over my shoulder. I say, ""Stop it!"" but they think I'm joking. Then I yell, ""Is everything public property?!"" and storm out and into Jake's room, slamming the door. The telex is long. It's about getting a group of people together to go to the woods to do our papers. The way he wrote the letter was cool. He put it inside the binding of a book and left some of the book pages in it.

"This was also about Mary Gardinier, but in a different context.  We were in high school, and we were getting to be very close, without ever having expressed our feelings in words.  We had a couple of classes together, and then had one with a girl who might have been my wife Bonita, except that she had dark hair.  We (the dark-haired girl and I) were engaged, and she knew I was becoming interested in Mary.  I sat behind Mary and the other girl sat on my right.  She kept doing things like putting her head on my shoulder, putting her arm around me, etc.-all for Mary's benefit, I was sure.  I was very nervous, and whenever Mary would turn around, I would try to minimize the effect of the girl's affections without alienating the girl.  I really felt trapped on a tightrope.",Negative
"I'm walking around downtown in my raincoat and hat, not really knowing what to do. A woman comes up to me and asks me for change, but I remind her that she's already asked me twice today. She groans and takes off to a group across the street. ""Wow!"" I exclaim to myself, ""Amy is over there!"" I hadn't seen her since Junior High, so I walk over to her and say hello. She gives me a partial hug and we talk for a while. After a brief conversation, I pretend to be a Mafioso, and I look across the street at all the brand new seventeen story magnificent gleaming coffee places. I hop across the street, and take off my jacket. An old lady walks up, and I whisper something to her in Italian. She nods knowingly, and disappears. I put my coat back on, look around shiftily, and go inside and get an espresso.",Positive
"I only recall this dream vaguely: We got two girls in the car of a friend (a friend only in the dream; in real life I don't know him) and then we went to a party at an unknown place, but we did not like the behavior of the girls (whom we did not know) and we went alone out of the party. The girls were very haughty and they seemed to be in complicity. At that moment I woke up.",Positive
"I found a dead body out the front hidden under some tree branches. I went inside to call the cops but I couldn't remember the number. I tried to read a magnet on the fridge, which had different ones to call, but I could read it. It was suddenly black outside. The kitchen light wouldn't turn on. I did a reality check and 'woke up' but then went back to the dream. The cops came and then left. These girls came in to party and I made them get out. They tried to steal some sauces. The window started breaking and I had to keep checking the doors were locked. Mom 'stole' these cars, which were long oil-ish trucks. She went to a food shop. This lady came and she was a bad guy. She could see the future in one of her eyes. Someone threw little rocks at Ezra. One hit the window but it didn't break. We stole a truck and I moved the second one and parked it well. Then the car was joined to this gigantic dormitory thing. There was an all guy band. Two were Jewish. One looked like a Jew but the other didn't. The one that I could tell was a Jew was hot.",Negative
"There were slow zombies. There were patches of people still alive. I was at a school place and the kids there weren't helping out. This lady called a meeting and everyone ran to this room and sat down. The door to the room was saloon like (it was a kitchen) and it didn't close. The zombies got in and I was near the door. I told everyone to be still and the zombies just walked past, looked around and kept walking. When some of them passed, everyone scattered. A few others and I sat at some desks. The zombies just walked past again. Later, only a few of us were left. Analisa was there and I asked her about the stopover times for America and the UK. She said it was as few days for America and 15 days for the UK. Then I was in an area that had something to do with science. The rooms were full of medicine and stuff. We looked outside and lots of zombies were coming (we were like the last ones left). We went into this freezer to hide. Then it was a game. Ezra and I had this thing out the back of the old house. It was sort of like a vertical bullet and was like a TARDIS inside. It also had this tight spot with a pee box and a big toilet. People would come sometimes to trade stuff or they would just steal. We discovered a way to beam up to space. There was a call from some official people, including Poppa.",Positive

"I have a feeling that something happened before this part of the dream, but I cannot remember it. I was in the deep water in the swimming pool at the Tudor Arms where I have a swimming class. I was holding on to the edge. A boy I knew in second grade and met again later in junior high at a young people's group and who is 19 now and a student at Case and goes steady with a girl he met at the church we go to - was standing beside the pool and helped me out. I went down the steps to the elevator as he walked down the way to the shower room and I said I would see him downstairs.

Mom was pregnant and pretty far along. I drove her somewhere and we got into this big argument and we yelled loudly and I got angry. Then it was a movie. These 4 teens/young adults were at this house. There were dragons in this building across the road and they could talk. They had to sleep on this 3 layer platform outside. Three moved to a lower layer and one left and went inside. It showed a dragon stabbing a blanket and then it showed them sleeping underneath. A guy inside came up from a trapdoor to the basement. There was a hologram of these nerdy collector cards if you took this carpet away. He ended up finding out all this information about it and got armour and special powers. He took some others to this bridge thing. They had to hold hands and touch this thing and hold their hands up high and aim at the bad guy (who was fighting the good guy). It was hard to keep your balance though and they lost the first time.,Negative

Later everyone has to leave the boat house and then, in a few minutes, a huge wave tears the boat house away and whips it out to sea.

There was a meeting and I sat with Eva facing rows of girls. Very boring. At one point all shifted seats so that the different races were separate. R. was there. Then we were in another room and returned to arrange the first for another meeting. The seats were in small groups. R. said to put them in rows. I started to do so but it was muddy and sloppy. I said we'd skip this row where two clumps of bushes and a big puddle would be in the way and spread the rows so that people could walk in and not get muddy. So I set one chair in a soft place before a good walk and tried it but one leg kept sinking deeper.,Positive
"My dream started off with me at my house and I was walking in front of my garage to the side of my house. I saw two snow tigers in my back yard. At first they didn't do anything, but then they started clawing at the fence. The fence had a nut and bolt and the more they scratched at it, the more it came unloose, but after about one minute they had broken free and came right at me. The bigger one grabbed my left arm, the other my right. I remember sensing another one but it wasn't around. I broke my left arm free and punched the tiger, and as soon as it happened, I felt I was dead and my next dream started.",Negative

"Lillian Silver, Judy Seagle, Gail Griffin, Martha Hanks, and I were riding in the car-possibly along Big Blvd.  We had stopped and were standing beside the car.  Gail and Martha were cigarettes in a Pall Mall pack.  Martha punched Gail, but it seems like it was from the outside, because upon examining the pack, I found it to have a small dent in one side.  I opened the pack, and could see on the charred end of one cigarette.  I emptied the pack, and they were all ashes.  I was horrified.  The explanation seemed to be that Gail had gotten so mad at Martha that her anger had burned them both to ashes.  I wondered it if had burned Lillian too, but then I saw her coming.  She said she had been to get a hamburger.  I hadn't seen her leave, so I asked her if Gail had gone with her.  She said no.  Judy and I then sat down and cried all we could.",Negative

I get into the van with Kelly and her new trucker boyfriend who wonders why I read so much. Then we're taking a bit of a break before leaving and I'm crossing this huge, rickety, wooden footbridge over the river at night. It's raining pretty hard and everything's wet and glistening. Halfway along I notice all kinds of loose change scattered across the bridge, so I go about picking it all up, especially the pennies, because ""I'll need all the luck I can get."" I find one really huge penny -- it's about a foot in diameter. This one's really lucky. As I'm kneeling to pick up all the change, a man comes along with his two kids.

Then the site to download from was down and I couldn't find something to transfer it with.

"Last night I had spme pretty strange dreams. First, the one I can remember best, is that Mom and I were in the airport and we were going somewhere. Actually I can't remember where we were going. ____ leaving town as if we were going to my relative's home town. And I had to go to the bathroom, actually, we both did.  For some reason, we went in the same stall _______kind of take turns going and we chattered and took turns going______. So that's what we did in this airport dream.______ Well, we heard this message come over the intercom, talking to some other person, telling this other person that they had better go quickly, not just sit around, or the toilet would flush automatically before they were ready. And I realized that they were doing surveillance on us and they were making it so that only one person could go at a time, making it so that it would flush automatically for each person, so that I don't even know why they would have a reason to do this I guess they thought maybe somebody would either waste water or waste something _______________. But I was having her open the stall and then close it again so that it would seem like another person went in there so that I could go too, and they wouldn't know we were both in there. As I describe this, I remembered what happened before this, what led up to this. I was dreaming that Mom and Dad were home and for some reason Mom and I were both sleeping in the bedroom downstairs. And Dad was supposed to come to the bed in a little while, but he was playing his computer game or something. And it was like 11:00 at night, but Mom said, ""I'm hungry. I want to go eat something."" And so I suggested, ""Well, we should go upstairs to my bed so that when Dad goes to bed in his bed and goes to sleep, we can get up without waking him up. Because if we stay here and he goes to sleep, when we get up, then he'll wake up."" So we went up to my bed and then, I guess, before we knew it we were walking downtown to this restaurant. And it was someplace -- I don't remember where it was -- oh, it was a Chinese place. And I had, we were all kind of sharing, but I had some kind of chicken, it was like fried sesame chicken, but it was, there was something else too. And there wasa plate of something else too, some kind of meat. And I was thinking, you know, ""I should have vegetables, spinach and meat and ______."" And I thought ""I usually have meat and a vegetable. And she said, ""Oh well, it's alright."" You don't have to worry about that, you have vegetables in the freezer. I couldn't really taste in this dream, but as I ate the fried chicken, I realized that there was some broccoli and some other kind of steamed vegetables in the sauce too. I can't remember what the other dish was that I had. And I think, I don't know, I thinkthe air port thing was separate, not part of the restaurant thing.

He is standing, wearing a tank top and some leotard-like, flesh-colored outfit, like he's naked, only he's not. His legs don't move, and in fact I don't see legs. He's sort of stiff. We make love passionately. Now I go out and see Derek in a car. There are five cop cars in a line and his car is right behind them, a perfectly safe place to be. Another man is in the backseat of Derek's car and he opens the door and invites me in. I get in, happy to be alone with Derek. I curl up with the other man who says it's OK to press back against him if it's more comfortable. Derek gets out to rearrange himself and his assistant helps him back into the car. We are going to be together and that makes me happy. [BL]",Positive
"I was sitting on huge rocks which formed a breakwater. It surrounded a small body of water. There seemed to be several people sitting on this breakwater with me watching fish which looked a little like seals jumping around in the water. Everyone was afraid to walk across the water because these seals could bite so hard they could kill a person. However, they wouldn't bother you if you stood still. All the people had their legs tucked under them and were on the rocks. I decided to walk across the water. When I did, not one seal bothered me. But as I returned to the breakwater rock and stopped for a moment, they started to jump at me.",Negative

"I am with a large group of noisy veterans in a crowded restaurant. A menacing black man approaches. We argue. He begins shooting me point blank in the hip with a forty-five automatic, taunting me with every shot. I am screaming, ""Stop it. Stop it."" Then I capitulate. He is right. I am wrong. I sense the bullets have missed my vital organs and that I will live. The next day I return with Ed W., who is dressed in full combat gear. I find the black man. With a small pair of scissors I quickly stab each lung twice, then puncture his heart. The skin of his chest fills with blood. ""I'm sorry,"" I say, mocking him. ""I'm so very, very sorry."" I continue to taunt him until he is dead.",Negative

"(09/04/01)[""Auditioning Ebenezer McScrooge.""] I am the director of a play. I am auditioning actors. I see a line of four men who look stoic and stern. I ask them if they are here to only audition for the McScrooge part or if they are interested in other parts as well. One wears cotton fake sideburns. He is only interested in the McScrooge part. I decide to audition these men first so they can leave after that part is worked with. Now the scene changes and I am working in secret with a naval situation. I am standing on a submarine and moving a yellow cloth up and down on a rack, like a towel rack. I am in danger of being discovered as a spy, so I go high up on a shelf of dirt. I hide there. They are looking for me. I am very aware that I am sitting on an edge of the cliff and am slipping. I could fall and kill myself. I cling to the edge hard, worried I will fall. I keep scooting back away from the edge and then slipping back toward it. I feel fear. Then there is an odd sequence where I am experiencing sexual excitement. Lydia is touching Dwight and transferring the feelings into me. I don't know how she is doing this because Dwight isn't there at all. She is sitting on my right on that narrow shelf/ledge,",Negative

Gwynn is batting .390, but Thomas is batting .340 with 110 runs 140 runs batted in, and 40 home runs. Thomas' stats are conceivably Triple Crown numbers. So, I decide Thomas, hands down.

"Derek and I are going to have sex. It is a very complicated ritual. I have to lay a certain way. His wife is coordinating and assisting all this. She brings me a wheelchair with cushions in it and places it over Derek who is laying on his belly on top of me. I'm now supposed to get up and sit in the wheelchair. I don't want to. I think all this is unnecessary. If all these people would just go away (Ellie and Kyle are both there, each in their own pickup truck), things would happen naturally. I try to tell Ellie to leave and I'd find a ride home myself later. She gets out of the truck and refuses to leave. She is being protective of me. Derek gets confrontational with her, saying she's done this sort of thing before (been hostile or refused to do what he said, or something like that).

"I was sitting over on the front porch of the B. family and all seven children were there too, laughing and joking. The parents and grandparents were there, and me too. Of course, in real life we couldn't all be sitting on the porch, but in my dream they were. Suddenly I wasn't on the porch any more, but was talking to Mary B. over the phone. While I was talking to her, her little 4-year-old brother got on the line and said they had ice cream at his house and he'd like me to come over to his house and have some. (This is very common, not at all uncommon.) So I went over there. Next thing I knew Mary asked me to stay all night (which is another common occurrence). All of a sudden the third floor of her house was a huge, big attic, no partitions -- a huge ballroom attic. I didn't see it myself, but I knew it was up there. (Evidently I had seen one before in my history.) Up in this attic was living a professor from Case, a very fanatic type. I had never met him. He was living up in this attic with three daughters and his wife. One of his daughters was named Lucinda and the B's were terrified of him, but yet he lived up there. It seemed that I stayed over at B's for quite a few nights. Every morning this professor would tramp his kids down the stairs to the second floor and send them to three pianos which were lined up along the walls. Each morning he would run these children down there, and say they had to practice all day long and they would very obediently do it. For quite a few days Mary and I didn't pay any attention to him, but one morning he cornered us and said he was going to beat us up because of our morals. Mary and I ran screaming down the stairs to the first floor and hid behind the stairs. He came running after us and for about four days. He was searching for us all over town and all this time we stayed crouched behind the stairs -- didn't go out to eat or go to the bathroom or anything. Finally one day he saw a coat moving behind the stairs so he grabbed Mary by the ankle, pulled her out and took her upstairs with him. I wasn't going to let Mary suffer alone, so I came out and went upstairs after him because if she was going to suffer, I was going to suffer too. I went running all over the upstairs, opening the doors and yelling, ""Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary!"" Then suddenly from downstairs Mary called up to me and said, ""What's the matter, Sally? Wake up, you must have been dreaming,"" and in my dream I had been dreaming.",Negative

"I was back at Westport High School again, except this time I was with Astrid and Darlene, and I was there like a couple hours after school had left out for some odd reason. And I was there with my mobility instructor, Mr. Heffler, and they were doing some construction on the stairs and in order to actually get down the stairs, they had the stairwell part blocked off, and they had some like loose boards. You had to undo one of the loose boards and climb down a little step ladder makeshift thing to actually get down to the lower level. And the elevator was, it kind of worked sometimes and it didn't work other times, and we didn't want to take a risk. And I think me and Darlene were on the elevator one time, and the building had like five or six floors for some odd reason, and for whatever reason the elevator wouldn't stop at whatever floor we wanted. And I think this dream was a big hodgepodge mish-mash of all different stuff, and I think after I got my business done, I was like wandering around in this school building that was Westport High School, and it was all in shambles, and it was supposedly that way because they were doing construction. And I mentioned about the stairwell being blocked off and there was just stuff laying around all over everywhere. And it was real precarious. And Darlene and I had a cab to catch. I don't know what business we had to do over at the school, but after we finished our business we had a cab to catch at 4:30, I think. And it was real gray and rainy outside and we were making our way back to the cab circle because that's where the cab was going to pick us up. And I don't remember if I ever made it or not.

The stage shakes like an earthquake and made walking difficult). I strike up a conversation and lead her into a discussion about her first wife, i.e. me. I don't tell her who I am. He can't stand seeing us together talking, so he comes back to ""work on the set"" near us. He's painting shades of pink on the set. The stuff he's standing on (cardboard), starts to break and fall. He runs in place as it avalanches under his feet and into the water. Someone asks him how much is lost. He can't tell because it's underwater. I then have to leave, because I have a debt to pay and must go to the bank. I come back, dressed in a nice suit with my hair up. Now I can be identified as ""Jean,"" his first wife.

"I dreamed I was watching a television program at home with my mother and my three brothers. I cannot remember whether it was a familiar program, but I do remember it was in color because, in the dream, my brother told me that he didn't like a girl's dress in the program because it was an ugly shade of green. It had something to do with gangsters or spies, I believe, because there were shots. I don't remember any more. In the dream I was drinking lemonade.",Positive

"Baseball Game Conference  I'm in a conference room sitting at a table with other people. I know this is a baseball game. I have a small white ball like a golf or ping-pong ball. I throw it up and it bounces off the ceiling. I catch it. This is a home run. There is a sprinkler system in the building that I don't think is a good system. Something happens with the Armstrong High School principal. There are some army items there. People start to leave. I pick up a compound bow with arrows. I explain to two men who seem to be in charge that my brother Wally is an archer, and that this is his bow and arrows. I walk out of the room and the building. One of the men comes with me. I'm nervous that he comes with. I take a wrong turn and feel dumb. Outside the building I see my grade school classmate Eric Stoner and his mother near their vehicle. My college classmates Ryan Pug, Seth Voss, and others leave the parking lot in a van. Seth yells ""Sluuu"" as they drive away, and I yell back.",Negative
"I'm in a small plain room with a high ceiling and long tables going across. We're supposed to be looking at a film. It's the next place I went in the ""library"" and I'm on the staff here, the others are patrons. The person who set this up has to leave and asks me to take over. Again I'm not thrilled about this and say to the 3 or 4 others that I've never done this before. I also drop my stuff on the floor. (Books, notebook, etc.) While the film is going on (I guess) a troop of people, mostly kids, come through the door and into the next room (to their right - an open passage - room is dark - another door opposite - looks a bit lab-like). Dana's with them, and I go talk to her. I notice one, then another, then another, of these kids look like younger versions of people I know and I realize they must be the offspring (I'm only aware of boys, though) of those people. I'm taken aback and say to myself the time has passed and I didn't even know it - that my friends could all have kids this big. I say this to Dana and she agrees. She's trying to keep them all organized for a tour and periodically gives instructions - they go across and out the other door. They all get through and the lot leaves. I go back to the other room.",Positive
I turned down a brass bar and another fellow turned down another bar. He was instructor in an industrial school. My bar was a little darker where it was turned down than the other bar. I was saying or heard the second selection. Now I can't recall it. It was in the first or second race at Detroit track was going to win his race. I can't recall the name. I was driving and there were a lot of traffic lights where we had to make stops. I drove down a hill and it was icy. I had to make a sharp turn on the bottom and I made it.,Positive
"Vomit Whole Burgers  I'm at Rival High School with either my friend Kevin Simpson or Tiny Combs. There is a ramp there for freestyle bikers. I have a bike. We go out, I say excuse me to a guy coming in. I give Kevin or Tiny a buck on my bike back to his car. They have to step off the bike when I ride down the stairs. Near the road, I vomit. It is a weird feeling that I rarely get. I cough up thick chunks of food onto a newspaper. I vomit up two whole hamburgers! A man in a funny looking car drives by. While I vomit, Kevin or Tiny laughs, saying, ""You're puking!""",Positive
"I'm in a bus and a facilitator of a group like Mobility International. One of the guys gets outside the bus and clings to the outside as we are driving fast down the road! I insist that he come back inside. He refuses. It's a power struggle. I point out he could be in danger. He points out he's just fine. I call up to the driver, ""Stop the bus. We won't go until you come in."" He comes in, upset with me. I go up front to explain to the driver and Susie what happened. We continue the journey, but I keep having those kinds of standoffs with other group members. They are not cooperating and I'm getting tired of having to keep them in line.",Negative
"I am at a lecture at church. Frank comes in late, wearing a red scarf. (It looked like a prayer shawl.) He sits next to Bud and me; it is early spring: view of bright blue sky and new leaves on trees. It is beautiful. But we cannot stay there; we have some car trouble in the garage: oil smell. He tilts car up. I leave and go back to lecture. Also talk to a man on my left, a priest, who listens to what I have to say about coincidences. But he still mostly laughs it off.

"Observing At Armstrong  I am at Armstrong High School in the office. There is a new female principal. She is in her office with some teenage girls. The girls may be the woman's daughters. I talk to the woman in her office. At first I close the door, but then I open it because it doesn't matter if its' closed. I tell her who I am, what I do, that I graduated two years ago, and that I go to Brimson. I tell her that I had come before to do classroom observations for my Educational Psychology class, and I'm back to do more observations. I ask if she'll write me a pass. She asks me in whose room I'll be observing. I say Mr. Hacker, Mr. Grizzy, and others: whoever doesn't mind me being there. She says that Mr. Hacker will mind that I'm there. I tell her that he won't mind my presence. We disagree.",Positive

"This doctor had to come out and examine Mom because to prove that she was not medically capable of playing real drums because one of those ____ drums not really accepted by the music community very well. They were kind of frowned upon like artificial or fake. So and one of the _____ really accept the fact that this was necessary. And they had the doctor come up and prove that she couldn't really do it the right way, and then they would let her use a key-based knee (?) type of thing. And there was this one particular type of drum set that you had to lay down on the floor and like kick your feet and use your hands in order to do them. Oh my gosh [loud noise on tape], in my dream she was like 70 years old and couldn't even try to do that. That was odd.",Positive
"My entire family was embarking on a trip together. My parents, my siblings, and all of their children were all going along. They seemed to be in clusters in various places around the airport as we were waiting for our flight. However, I was alone. Jason S was in a handicapped stall and the restroom and he had Kaitlyn S and another small child with him. I was listening and observing, yet I wasn't in the restroom. He was either explaining something to them or explaining to them that they had to wait until they were finished there. I don't recall now. I was visiting several of the shops in the airport looking for watch batteries. I was looking for two different sizes. I finally found them and bought them. I went up an escalator. I think that's where I needed to go to catch our flight. Just at the top of the escalator, there was a service desk. It was very awkward because it was just a few feet from where you step off of the escalator. This was especially bothersome to me since escalators make me nervous anyway. There was also a cash register at the service desk. I had gone to sit down and realize that one of the watch batteries. I had been sold was not the size that I was looking for. They had given me the wrong one. I took it to the service desk to see if I could return it there and get my money back. She said that I could. Oddly, however, I was concerned as to whether or not I have enough cash, and I looked in my wallet and saw that I had two dollars. I knew that would be enough. I then went to the restroom. I was in one of the stalls, and I was either sitting on a chair next to the toilet. Maybe I was sitting on the floor by the toilet. I had put my purse, on top of the toilet and had my arms crossed on top of it resting my head on my arms and napping. I don't remember what caused me to wake up. When I awoke, however, I was slightly groggy, but I got up, left the restroom, and went back to find my family. I passed one of the members of my family in one of the walkways, and they told me where different groups of the family were gathered. There is a group at the gate. There is a group in a restaurant. I decided to go to the gate. Bill F is standing there talking to daddy, who is sitting in one of the chairs. Bill F is standing next to a beverage cooler that is approximately 4 feet tall and may be 2 1/2 to 3 feet in diameter. It's the kind of cooler that you might see at an athletic event for the players except that I have never seen one this large. Those are also usually orange or yellow in color. This one is what I would describe as a frosty white color. I think the lid was red. See through it, just enough to realize that the beverage inside was red. Bill F was trying to explain to daddy that they were treating it as a carry on. They weren't going to check it. I was listening and not understanding what was going on. Daddy said something about it being sealed tightly enough with Bill F said it needed air. It was then that I discovered that Brian F was inside this container. I was furious. I couldn't believe they were trying to sneak him on the plane without having to pay for him. That he didn't seem all that bothered by it. I kept saying it is illegal. It's not right. I finally got so upset I just turned and walked away.",Negative

"I am looking at a slide, holding it up to the sky for light. It's a picture of Serena sitting on the ground. She's wearing a bandana on her head and she's facing away from me. She's wearing a shirt with a design on it that is strange. Somehow I can see through the design and I can look into outerspace. It is pitch black through the shirt with little stars twinkling. I can see right through her into another dimension. The cool thing is, is when I move the slide to a different angle - I can see Serena change angles. It's as if it is a movie instead of a slide. But the image only moves as far as I move it. When I move to a different spot I can actually walk around in the world of the image. I think of how I want to have a picture like this of Walter. I would walk around and the image would adjust and I would be able to see him in San Francisco even though I was in New York. [Serena = friend; Walter = long distance boyfriend]",Negative
"There is a raging, swollen river and I am to float down it. I have a guide. She says, ""You sure are scared."" I said, ""Yes, I am."" She couldn't understand why I'd be afraid. I was afraid I'd go under and be drowned. I see a boat going down river. It's dragging a long chain, like a bicycle chain. A loop of it catches on my right big toe and almost pulls me with it but I unloop it from my toe. Then I dive in and rush down stream. I get out. An Asian man is there. I have a list of places I saw on my travels. Mile post ----- is one of the entries. He speaks German and so do I, except toward the end I slip into Spanish.",Negative
"Someone was chasing two Indians, who were suspected of some crime, down the train tracks, just ahead of an oncoming train.  Since they made no attempt to leave the tracks, for some reason, I assumed they would still be on the tracks when the train made a big curve and approached my location, so I planned to head them off.  When the train appeared, though, they were not in sight; instead, there was a man doing something to sabotage the train or the track-I'm not sure what.  I knew I would need a weapon to threaten him with, to force him to undo what he had done.  I went to a nearby tool shed and decided on an axe.  I told him he had made a serious mistake (at least that's what I wanted to tell him, but said ""done a serious thing"" instead) because he was messing with the federal government.  He was disdainful and refused to undo what he had done.  Before I could use the axe, he pulled a gun and aimed it at my chest.  I didn't really think he would shoot, but I was scared.  I didn't show it, however.  I looked him steadily in the eye and said, ""I'm not scared, because if you shoot me, a million people from the government will come looking for you.""  He continued to point the gun at me in silence for a few seconds, thinking about what I had said, and then he fired twice in succession.  To my shock, I felt no impact.",Negative
"We were going to go to some waterslides. We were out the front of home and Valerie and kids, Mom, Dad and Ezra were there too. We only had one car. Farrah got the mail and it was all for me. One was from this place to do with school. It had a bunch of names on it but the only name I recognized was Gregg. There was some mail from some Spongebob place. Ariana was in the back seat and wearing a Spongebob shirt. Farrah was in the driver's seat and Valerie was sitting on the boot. Mom and I went inside and she invited her brother so that Valerie wouldn't go. She knocked on the breakfast bar to pretend that she was knocking on the door. Then there was a real knock and Evelyn and a man (which was her father, but not really) and two dogs were there. She was talking to me and asked if I was going out and I said yes. Then there were heaps more people there. Ramona was there and I kept calling her Paul. I was yelling at the people to get out of the house and calling out for my keys. On the drive there I remembered I had my period so I decided to check how heavy I was when I got there.",Negative
"This guy had a little apartment. His friend caught up with him and then he left. The friend and I went back in. The guy was coming back and I hid in the shower. His friend tried to distract him and I had to move under this thing (that was like a bed). His daughter and her friend heard me and took a box that I was hiding behind away. Eventually the guy got distracted and I ran out. Then the guy came out and the daughter had told him I was in there. It had happened once before. I think the first time, Christopher Ryan was in the shower.",Negative
"I'm at the top of a waterfall or a rush of turbulent water. As I'm careening down, the water becomes a freeway, crowded with other cars. I'm out of control and I can only hope that as I merge into oncoming traffic, I don't hit anybody. I do manage by luck, not skill, to merge successfully. I am in the left hand lane (the fast lane). I must get over to the right lane to make an exit. I barely manage to do that. As I start to make a right turn to get on the road I think I want, I find myself being pulled backwards down another road that goes to the left. It's like a track (like in a Walt Disney fun ride), has hooked onto my van. I'm being taken for a ride. I have no control. I'm sitting behind the driver's seat; the van is going backwards and I can't see clearly where we're going. I'm alone and concerned that our van will crash into something. As I realize that I'm in a truck, I semi-relax, put my feet up and lean back. I watch traffic the van narrowly misses. The van is going fast. I get where I'm going and now I'm in my wheelchair.

The priest glanced at them from the altar. Later I was touring a residential area where I had lived years before. Other men were there. I wanted to climb a steeple. A man gave me a boost.

"I was at the Technical College for today. Tristan and I went to Mr Hoover's class, but it was only us two. There were supposed to be three others, but they weren't here and had been absent the last few days too. It was in a small-ish lecture theatre that was very black. Mr Hoover said he'd have to move us to a different class because he couldn't teach a class of two (and the first activity was in a group of four). We had a big lecture on with another guy and I got there a bit late. I sat away from everyone else. I was next to a black girl who introduced herself and asked how old I was. I said 23, then went 'no, 25. Don't ask how that happened' and she looked at me funny and then said she was 26. I said everyone else was like 18, so I was glad there was someone older in here. The lecturer said that anyone who wanted to leave could and one guy got up and left and then heaps of people got up. The only people left were people from last year. I moved over to sit with them. Then it was a break and there were three toilets. Fletcher was still in the room. I went to the toilet over one side but there wasn't actually a toilet in there. I went to the middle one, but there was a wall missing and just a curtain to pull. I went to the furthest one and I think there was another issue with that one.",Negative

It's through a house, and the house is high off the street. Bit of a climb to get there, then we all get led into the house.

My line manager, who discusses my contract with me, is Larry, a colleague/client at work in waking life. The job seems boring even before I've started, but there's a recession on, so I have to take it. I ask if I could do just 3 days a week. He says ""No, you have to do the 4 1/2"". ""OK"" I say, ""No problem, see you Monday"". I leave the building with 2 colleagues (colleagues from old jobs in waking life). We walked down flights of steps in what seems like a concrete carpark - scruffy, dirty. The whole city feels like this - over crowded and crumbling. I have to find the train station. Now I'm speaking to my brother on my cell phone. He says he'll help me locate the station. It seems much more complicated that it ought to be.",Positive
I was living in a studio apartment but there was no carpet and one side of the room was filled with old furniture stacked up. There was a dusty fireplace and I started cleaning it out. Then I opened one of the doors and I was in someone else's house. It was a huge mansion. Outside was a swimming pool. The people who lived in the house saw me and I told them I was sorry I must be sleepwalking. Then I went back into my room and there was a white cat. I didn't want to throw the cat out but I wasn't allowed to have pets. I started calling all these people trying to find a home for the cat.,Positive
"I had several fragments of dreams that seemed sort of interesting. In the first dream, Bill H. had just finished giving me a test of some sort. It wasn't very much like the Rorschach he actually gave me last night, because it consisted of seeing or talking about all these real little people and things. But after we had finished with the test, or as the very last part of the test, he was taking a shower and I was supposed to watch him and then take one myself, or sort of take one with him. And this seemed significant when I woke up from it.",Positive
"I was standing in the dining room at Mom's, watching TV. The second Twilight movie was on, and we watched it for an hour, but all they did was sing and it had nothing to do with Twilight. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were in it. But then Kristen Stewart was Leighton Meester but she looked really gross and Mom and Darren said that she was really ugly. I realized that it was a preview. I was telling Mom that the books were addictive, but the movies suck. Dad picked Ezra up to go somewhere. It was raining and really late. In the morning, Mom took me to university as she was taking Ezra to something up that way. She dropped me off at the train station and said she would get me in a second. Then it was World of Warcraft and I was waiting at the edge of the platform. This level 10 called [what looks like Thedd, but it's messy] was getting attacked by Murlocs and crabs. I killed them. It was nearly time for my class to start, so I called Mom and she said something I can't read, but it was on Facebook and there was something about a movie and I assumed it was a bug. My car was now there and I drove it to the other side and hit the wall. The guy next to me gave me the key to his car and took mine. I tried to get in the back. I think it says 'quick fingers'. I was then at Nana's at the table and there was a $10 Royal Show thing. There was something about long hair and a joke about something I can't read.",Negative

"I was in some sort of competition on campus.  There was one event each day, and five events.  I don't remember why, but I wanted to finish two days early.  The first three days' competitions were over.  For the fourth event, my boyfriend Jeremy and I went up somewhere around the science buildings.  It was a covered area, but there were no walls, more like a parking garage.  There was a table.  Jeremy was to time and judge to make sure I was doing the things properly.  The task was to turn over stacks of coins using only my mouth, in a certain amount of time.  At some point while I was doing this, an opponent showed up and began doing it as well.  Then we moved on to the fifth event.  There were cards, I think, with math problems on them.  I was not clear on what the task was.  I sat and watched as my opponent gestured around the corners of a square on the table as he did the math problems.  I barely glanced at the math, and just followed the lead, moving my hand around the squares and counting.  Afterwards he asked if I got 4.  I think I said I did.  It turned out I was wrong, but my finger was only off by one position on the table.  It wasn't until then that I realized that the math problems had some indication of the position on the square- I had gotten incredibly close by luck, but I still felt gypped by not knowing how the task worked.",Negative

I go with this man and approach the hiding men. My flashlight isn't put together or working yet, so I use the light from the other man's flashlight. We get closing to the men.

"(08/16/99)[""Flying in my truck because it would be fun.""] I am working on a project. I am looking at the printed pages of the galley sheets of a book I am writing. I realize I need to ask some more questions of the newspaper office. I walk outside. I get into my green pickup truck and am driving down a city street. I look up in the sky and see an airplane and think it would be fun to fly in my truck. As I think it, I will it to fly. We go up above the buildings and fly across town. I am grinning in the pleasure of having that power and in actually flying. I choose not to fly too high up, in case something goes wrong. It's a bumpy landing. I gather up my papers and get out. I go into the newspaper office. No one is there. I walk toward the inner offices. A line of people come out, from their coffee break. One sees me and goes straight to the files to get my project. I say, no, this time I have a question I need to ask Ted, the owner. I look at the galley sheet and I can't remember the question. I apologize to the man and try to remember the question. Then I ask how much it will cost to print it. The man says this is a newspaper office. We only print the newspaper. I look up and see that ""my dad"" is here also. He has an artificial eye, a large blue one which he nearly takes out, yet he also sees me with it. He is very plump and short. At first, I think I see his chest hairs exposed with a tattoo. But I realize it is his arm. Now I leave to return to the truck. I wonder if ""Dad"" will be there so we can ride back together. He is. A young boy from the newspaper office is there visiting with a young boy accompanying me. He doesn't want to leave his friend. I say firmly, James, it's OK. I'll be back soon, probably many times. James feels OK then and leaves. A young boy is in my wheelchair and my ""dad"" is at the drivers wheel. I ask how will I get into the van. The boy then realizes he has to give me my wheelchair back and ""dad"" has to back up the van so I can get in the side door. ""Dad"" moves the van and I see a small toddler like Amelia out of the truck and playing near the wheel. It was a lucky escape she wasn't run over.",Positive

"I'm at an old railroad station or museum; the people have just finished a meal and are in a room with wooden benches as at a fine old railroad station with a fireplace. A man comes in that I know to be a poet and teacher. ""Let's get this discussion session going,"" he says. I ask which poet. He says Robert Frost, so I decide to stay since I can discuss without study. Just as we get started, the leader of the Retreat Center comes back with two heavy suitcases and looks tired. My friend Earl is sitting close to me, agitated with several sheets of papers in his hand with columns of figures I can see. Earl says to the old director, ""The Retreat has this estimate for tax purposes, and this other one... they are different by 48 cents."" I say to Earl in a whisper, ""I'll give you the 48 cents so we can get started on the poetry."" He ignores me. The director must have heard me since he says to Earl, ""Hand them to me."" He looks and changes them to the same figure with his pen, sarcastically I think--and justifiably so. Earl is still not satisfied. I say loudly, ""I'll donate a dollar to the Retreat Center so we can get to the poetry."" I'm angry with him.",Negative

I cross Roundabout Way and as I do Elise Rooks drives by in her blue car. I want to yell to her but I don't. I think about going out to my girlfriend Annie's house even though I know she's at school. I can see the constellation Orion really well.,Negative
"In this dream I think I was just an onlooker to an old-time, meaning a 17th or 16th century fight aboard a ship, like between pirates. The only thing I can remember about it was I think that the hero of the dream was hiding in a big barrel. He was hiding down in this thing, and evidently he was on board the enemy ship or something because I remember him being crouched down in this big barrel.  There was only one ship. I saw a number of people, all men fighting.",Positive
"My sister and I were at some kind of open fair and we were sanding by some kind of gambling game, elevated on a slant where you would place your money in one of the open little squares and the guy who ran it would let a marble or something start at the top and roll down until it went into one of the squares The fist few trys my sister lost, but then she started winning. When she started winning, the guy wanted to change the game and did and instead of little separate squares on the slanted board, there was just a flat surface with a division in the middle to separate it into two sides. He set up pegs on one side to be his and pegs actually cylindrical circles about _"" long and _"" in diameter) on the other for her. It seems I was standing by watching all this and when he started the game by turning on a vibrator, the object was to see who had the most pegs standing in the end. Then the vibrating pegs turned into football players with me one of them running with the ball and being tackled.",Negative

The weight room turned into a thrift store, but all arranged by solids/stripes. I found an old cotton cut-up football jersey I loved. I was at a picnic. The Kennedy family had a tree house there. They had a tall ladder partly painted, partly just metal, not painted, that they took down when the press was around. They had a tall vertical sign, hand-painted that said, ""The Kennedy's"" There was a fountain. A very old concrete water fountain. I was trying to put a post in the ground for a volleyball net. The net was already attached. It kept leaning over and the net was not taught. I kept trying a few inches over to dig a hole. We tried to put the post into a metal drain. We took off the cover. Inside was a pool of water. A copper whale had been in the water, covered with the lid since we were little. It had a hinged mouth that moved.

It's a small three-person place. Planes take off to our left. They speed down the runway. I don't know if they will lift off enough to fly over the hills at the end of the runway.

"This dream is merely a fragment, but it is all that I can remember. All that took place was in the home of my sister-in-law (my husband's brother's wife) who is 35. My sister-in-law and I were standing in the bathroom and were looking the room over. My sister-in-law began explaining to me the details of how she planned to have the room remodeled. In my dream it seemed as though there were definite plans there were going to be carried through immediately. All I remember seeing is the glass mirror of the medicine cabinet. In my dream, however, the mirror appeared more metallic than glass. My sister-in-law explained that she was going to have this mirror extended in a modern curved line down to the bathtub. Then I remember seeing my sister-in-law's face very vividly. I was very much impressed by her plans and just a little bit envious.",Positive

Not long after I'd sat down, I saw two hands come down under the door and then a zombie girl suddenly came at me from under the door. It was really fast and scared the hell out of me [IRL too, my heart was pounding when I woke up]. Her face was quite graphic, a white eye and rotting flesh. The only thing I had as a weapon was this thing that was like a giant straw. I stabbed her in the face when she came through again, I put my foot on her face to pull it out. I heard other zombies in the toilet, so I readied myself and opened the door and started stabbing them. I ended up in the male toilets and there were some other people still alive in there. They had forks and I was annoyed that I didn't have a fork. We got to the main part of the shop and found some other weapons. There weren't that many zombies around here. While I was looking for a weapon in a corner of the storeroom, one of the women with us started bending over weirdly and she suddenly turned and went at me. I started whacking her but couldn't stab through for some reason. One of my friends killed her.

I always wished that I could drive although this is the first dream I have ever had where I'm doing it. The main senses I used in this were hearing because I could listen to him and hear what he was saying, I could hear the other traffic around me. And feeling.

"I dreamed I was out with a friend whom I hadn't seen for a long time, a boy Eddie Book bounder. We were out on a double date or triple date. There were several couples and we had a picnic right along the Miami River somewhere. Eddie had this blanket spread out on the river. This was rather unusual. He said it wasn't so unusual for him because he could fly, and he did fly. He was flying along. We asked him how he could fly. He couldn't fly too high, maybe 100 feet or so. This was pretty interesting. I wanted to know how fast he could come straight down and stop before crashing to the ground. He could come down pretty fast and stop. We looked real close at the river, and he seemed to have a sand bag on which he had his thing on because the girl who was with him walked out on the blanket, and it didn't sink in the river. It was probably right across a sand bar. Hall: They were on a picnic, and they weren't in cars, but they were walking. Sam didn't recognize any of the other people he was with except for Eddie. Eddie wasn't lying on the blanket. He was just lying up in the air. It was kind of a swimming-like motion that Eddie was making to fly. The blanket was spread out on the river and not on the road. The blanket was actually on a sand bar rather than right on the river itself.",Positive
"The group of us had just heard something about Africa, a talk. We were thinking of going there. My grandfather had evidently been ____________________. He had some relations living with him at the time, but it seems as if one of them died. He was about a 75-year-old man. I found myself, plus a few other people, were going on a trip, but before we went, my mother wanted me to go over and ask my grandfather about the feasibility of our family going to Africa. We were in a 1955 Plymouth. So we went over there and I was appointed to ask him. When I first got in, he was busy talking with a doctor. The doctor, I guess, was just giving him a little examination and also talking about the glories of Africa. It also seems that the doctor was something like a vacuum cleaner salesman, but that's a little foggy, and I can't quite remember it. When the doctor finally got through talking to my grandfather, I asked him about Africa and taking my parents. He said a very emphatic no. He said my mother cold never live there. He said there were too many snakes. He said that you live net to a big zoo because they had caged animals, but he said the only way you could live down there was to shoot and kill the food, and he didn't think my mother would ever get along. I went back to the car. It seems as if my mother had gone on to a camp we were staying at and the car had come back and it had 2 other guys and myself so that there were 3 in all, but we drove a ways and then we came to a large zoo, just like the one my grandfather described in Africa. It almost seems as if we were in Africa. We looked around there for a while, and then there were 3 African people who came up to the car and wondered if we were going back to camp. We said we were, so they asked for a ride. The car started back for camp, and I remember we were all rather tired as it had been a long trip. The guys said to stop at the next bar and get a drink. I was a little worried because I knew my mother wouldn't like it if she smelled it, and also we had one guy that I was sure was under 21. Now for this scene it seemed to be sort of in the United States because there were tobacco fields and the billboards were in English. There was one lipstick billboard and therefore red lips on the girl. Just about this time the alarm went off.",Negative

"Darren was going to school to become a doctor. I was still working on my Ph.D. Someone was saying something about the medical degree having more prestige or being more valuable than the Ph.D. I stated my usual case that I agree that the medical degree is indeed very valuable to society. We certainly need good doctors and good doctors perform a great service to society. However, they also get paid very well for it and it does not require the same mental capabilities as a Ph.D. People who study for a Ph.D. are not easily recognized for their value to society, though a good Ph.D. brings great value. And they do it knowing they will likely never receive the same financial rewards as a medical doctor nor be given the same respect. In addition, the Ph.D. is by far a more difficult degree to earn mentally because it does not require the memorization of known information or already identified knowledge but instead requires the discovery of new knowledge. A M.D. can get their degree by getting certain grades and fulfilling certain tasks such as residency. A Ph.D., on the other hand, can get stellar grades, complete all requirements and still not receive their Ph.D. if a panel of judges does not approve the final dissertation work based on the dissertation defense - the final step of the Ph.D. process. I don't know who I was telling all of this to.",Positive

It's like a bazooka or flame thrower fire starts. I see his eye huge, scared and prominent peering out at the fire. I know I've got him now. I wonder how ""they"" made his eye so prominent. Probably colored it a special color to draw attention to it. The fire spreads and he runs out. I yell, ""Get the money."" I start to go in, but the flames are too much. So I order four women to go in (deputies) They do, and throw out boxes with stacks and stacks of bills.",Negative
"We went for a drive and it was late at night. I was with Mom and Ezra. There was a little ball of light that looked like it was floating. We were living in this place which like a caravan park, but it wasn't. It was like a small community thing. We went back a while later and there was a cloud with the light and there were sparks. It was worrying me. At some point we went to see some live concert in a small area in a tunnel. We couldn't stand and it was hard to get a seat. This young Indian guy got offered a house if he called the owner and get him to sell and do something else. We drove home and we lived near the beach. I was with some guy. Chiana (Farscape) had some food like those Turkish meat things. I signaled someone to get me some but realized she made some for me. I couldn't remember what they were called. We went to Dad's house. It was clean around the side and there was a toilet in his bedroom. We left the caravan park again. We stopped at a shop. The car was next to a window and I was on Ezra's side and he was on mine.

"I am in a pickup and camper parked on the sand next to the ocean. I am looking for a small green rowboat that is coming in over the surf. I think, ""That could be dangerous."" I see one, but it's not the one. I look out and see the ocean tide rising and approaching my truck. I say to my father, ""It's nearly up to the wheel. We'll have to move."" I start to back up, but some one right behind me has opened up a brown box in the sand, sort of like an engine cover and he's fixing something. I say, ""Hey, could you wait a minute on that so I can get by?"" He just stares at me and then continues. So I go around him, realizing I could have done that anyway. I didn't have to ask him to move. I go to a house. I walk up a flight of stairs and at the landing, I see a bedroom. I go in and look. It's not for the guests. It is the owner's private room. I see a comfy bed and a fire going in the fireplace. I say, ""How nice!"" I see hundreds of books on shelves all over the walls. There's a mesh screen nailed over them with wooden strips to keep people from taking the books. I look at how they did that. Then I leave the room to continue up the next flight of stairs, only I'm called back downstairs by a flaming redheaded girl child. I approach her. She's outside looking in. She says, ""Come downstairs and look. Quick!"" I look at the long set of stairs and say, ""No thanks! This is hard enough.""

"This is a two-part dream. Part one consisted of myself being inside of some type of store, and I was showing somebody or selling somebody some type of jewelry. There were two pieces. There was a mechanism about 6 inches in diameter with some sort of moving parts inside of the moving mechanism, a Marine Corps globe and anchor emblem on it. It was made out of gold, and there was also a device that resembled a cigarette case that had little bumps in it, little indentations. It was made out of silver, and I was trying to convince this person that they should buy the thing that was made out of silver, as opposed to the gold, because silver is a little bit more subtle. It doesn't shout status as gold does.  Part two consisted of, I believe, in the same store. An Indian was handcuffed to a railing inside of the store. He kept trying to get away, but couldn't quite do it. He was going through all kinds of contortions trying to break loose, trying to get free, but he couldn't do it.  In  part one of this dream about this mechanism, it was a male that I was trying to sell to. I couldn't identify him as anybody I knew, though, and in part two the Indian was also a male. That was the end of the dream.",Positive
"Ellie and I are walking down a hall, turn the corner and surprise my parents in lovemaking. I am embarrassed. We tip toe away. Later, I see my mother somewhere else and realize that my father was making love to someone else! Later, I'm driving a cart-like thing around the house. I turn right at the living room. Even though it's a house, there are streets and alleys. The snows have melted and the whole house is wet and drippy. I think, ""Hey, now that the snows are melted, I can do a big cleaning and put up pretty curtains."" As I drive the cart, my father reminds me that to go down Royal Ave. is better. I turn the cart around and say, ""You're right."" We drive on.",Negative

"I dreamed about an unknown person who had a snake and that another person and I stole it. My father realized this and made us give it back, scolding us, but she didn't get upset. Then we went over to a place where they sold Coca-Cola and she ordered one and told me that she wanted to take the straws because where she lived they didn't have any. So we opened a box and put many straws in for her to take. All of this took place in the school I attended until I was 11, but it was in the recreation room of the older girls.",Negative
"Am walking in the corridors of a hospital looking for the exit. Keep trying doors to see if they lead to steps down. No luck. All the walls are newly painted and are a shiny enameled white. There are no direction signs and no numbers or anything on any doors or walls ... just the bright white paint. I wonder why Fire Exit not seen and realize this probably painted over also and this carelessness disturbs me. Now and then pass an alcove and there see a patient or two lying on mattresses on floor and talking to visitors. At end of a long corridor, I am confronted by three or four doors. Open one slightly and see a patient inside and realize there is no exit here. Finally pass an administrative office with cashier's window in wall. A nurse directs me out.",Positive
"I left an institution without permission. An attendant saw me, but did not say anything. Later, a boy was helping me carry something across the grounds to another building. There were big spiders around us. When we reached the place, I saw a red building in the distance which I knew to be for female patients. It was like a building that I have seen frequently in previous dreams. I was employed at a modern printing plant. I worked with some women. I went outside and a girl about eight came and hugged me around my neck. I felt a paternal attachment to her, and I wished that she were my daughter. I suddenly remembered my job and I hurried back inside the plant.",Negative
"Walking past an athletic field where a game is being played on what looks like a football field. A high (about 8 feet) wire fence surrounds the field. There are 8 or 10 players on a side. A net, similar to a tennis net, stretches across the middle. The ball used is much like an indoor baseball, but a little smaller, and black in color. The side to the west kicks off, but the ball has a wide ""in"" curve, and goes out of bounds at about the 30 yard line, and rolls up against the fence. I wonder if the ball will roll under the fence, in which case I intend to throw it back; but the fence is ""tight,"" right down to the ground, and the ball stays in the playing field.",Positive
"I'm at the theater to watch ""Xiu Xiu"" with Laura. Laura goes into the auditorium and I go to the bathroom. The bathroom is an outsized, dirty locker room, a lot like the locker room at the public pool. I have to piss, and wind up peeing in the disused ashtrays. I hear a voice: Judi emerges from a stall. She has obviously been crying. I ask what I can do and we talk for a while. At length we get far friendlier than usual and have a good fuck on the floor. Afterwards I realize that Laura's probably wondering what the hell happened to me. By the clock only ten minutes had passed, but the sex felt too satisfying for it to have been that short. I decide my watch is wrong, and cross into the lobby.",Negative
I was at this house and there was this lady who always died at the same time everyday.

"I was walking along the perimeter of a cyclone fence enclosing a big grassy area.  As I continued to walk, I came across the heads and front half of sheep and goat bodies, entwined/impaled within the fencing.  This 'wall of death' continued on for maybe a hundred feet; many sheep and goats had died, and most of the carcasses had some dried blood on them, either from where the rear of the torso had gone missing, from hooves, or crusted around their eyes, nose or mouth.  They all looked so sad, and like they had died in a lot of pain.  I was horrified by the sight and tried to stay away from it.  I started to sob, feeling sorry for the pain the animals died in.  My dad tried to comfort me to no avail.",Negative

Dan Palmer was on OkCupid and I went on his profile to find it had been updated and filled out - he was 40 years old (which shocked me) and we had a 96% match.

"Jane C was working for a membership organization. I was having a discussion with her and some other people and she was implying that the members of her organization were lower class than other similar organizations. To help make her point she picked up a bottle and said, See, American Roadhouse. The bottle was some type of condiment from a table, such as in a diner. I knew what she meant but I didn't know exactly what was in the bottle. I continued to think about it and then realized American Roadhouse probably made three such offerings. Ketchup, Steak Sauces, and Bar-B-Que Sauce. I don't think we were actually at a diner though, because it seemed that we were at an office, at a computer, talking about software or entering the members into the computer. But it also seems that we had started with a discussion about members' needs. That is why Jane said what she did - to make a point that her members were happy with less than in many similar organizations.",Positive
"My boyfriend Jeremy and I were in my room. I was at a computer, and he was probably at his, and we were talking about Beatles music. It was a Wednesday, and I told him he should come to class with me tomorrow. He said no, that he would be out of place and nobody would know him. I told him well nobody knows me either. So he dropped me off at class and to my surprise he stayed- he went to the other side of the room and played DJ for them. Paul McCartney was there lecturing!  Then I remembered where we were, and caught Jeremy's eye. I motioned like a steering wheel- he could get a parking ticket. He ran out. After class I went to find him under a stairwell, like the one at the detox facility. He was laying on the ground, talking to our choir pianist. He asked if she was feeling any better, and she said that his advice about not eating so much or something worked. She got up and sat on his stomach, and slid off between his legs, hurting his groin. At some point in this, he donned bushy grey eyebrows and a long grey beard. It looked pretty funny. We were going to walk to the car when someone sitting on a bench got up and started to chase him, calling him Hank Turner. I warned, ""Jeremy..."" and I guess she realized it wasn't Hank Turner, whoever that is, and stopped chasing.",Negative
"Honest Interactions  I'm at a library. I go to a desk to pay for damage that was done to books while I check them out: one page was torn out of a book and a magazine. I don't think I inflicted the damage. I sit down across from a woman at the desk. There is a pile of money in front of me that she doesn't see because it's behind part of the desk. I give it to the woman, saying someone must have left it here. I think I do this because if came back to claim the money and I had it, I would feel guilty and greedy. So, I give it to the woman at the desk. I talk to her about paying for the missing pages. It will cost about $1 per page. I'm sick: I have a cold and my nose is running.

We walked on further and we came to a dredged spillway for water. It was dry. I walked out in the middle and it filled up with water. The water was about knee deep. Then we walked back along the sea wall, and I could see another smaller crocodile inside the big one as if it had been swallowed, except for its head which was in the mouth of the big crocodile.",Positive
"I am incarcerated somewhere with Dr Who (Peter Davisson) in a rather futuristic place, as though it were an episode of the show. I don't know how we got here but we didn't do anything wrong, and the Doctor is trying to get us out. They have him change clothes into a sort of prison uniform but it's green and has a turtleneck and matching socks and all. We've got an accomplice, I don't think he came in here with us, but he's helping us. We've managed to get the Doctor's clothes back, or we've found them, and he's changing and talking about what we're going to do when someone comes in. We're across a partition from the door, so we can't necessarily be seen, but the Doctor doesn't hear them and doesn't stop talking. I try to signal him, then whisper, ""Doctor!"", urgently, but he keeps on talking away and I'm getting scared. If we're caught we're sure to be in big trouble because the Doctor's changed almost everything now, except his shoes and socks, and they'll know what's happening for sure. The Doctor can talk his way out of lots of things, but this would definitely raise the alarm and we didn't want to do that. The plan had been for him to get out and then get me out, after he had some help. Is that right? Or were we all getting out together? Anyway, now he does shut up, and the moment is tense - we're about to be noticed by the men who came in - the first one is a typical bad-guy-in-an-authority-group TV or movie stereotype, and he's talking away to the 2nd, so he hasn't noticed right away. I think the Doctor's going to do some fancy talking and cover for me escaping.",Negative
"The Deadly Mini-Gun  I'm with another person walking north down the upstairs hallway of Carter School in Oak Valley. I feel that we are being followed, so we turn into the janitor's room to see who, if anyone, is following us. We wait a moment, and then the person I'm with points out to me that there is a gun being pointed at us through a hole in the wall, from where the boy's bathroom is. We are ""caught"", so to speak. Either I or the other person nonchalantly makes a move that seems like it would be of no consequence.

"Dropping Nice Pike  I'm in the Big Resort Area with my sister Ramona, a man, and a woman. We're fishing in an area of small rivers. The woman catches a small northern pike. I try to help the couple get a photograph of it by holding the fish for them. I drop the fish! It is in the water. We are in the water up to my chest. I pick the fish up out of the water. It is a good-sized pike: between seven and nine pounds, I estimate. I lose the fish again, dropping it in the water. I'm using my friend Kevin Simpson's telescoping fishing rod. I feel guilty that I dropped these people's fish. I case into the trees, in the woods, and on shore. I don't do this on purpose. The handle on my rod and the crank on my reel are broken.

"A bizarre dream. My friend Ralph has frozen his wife's breast milk into three iced lollies. But he has also separated he milk into three 'grades' according to creaminess. The creamiest one is a small knob of what looks like butter or clotted cream, wrapped in a piece of plastic food wrap. There's a group of us out on the streets - we're going clubbing somewhere. Amongst us are Ralph, his wife, my partner and myself, and possibly my friend terry, and some of my partner's friends like Kay. Kay seems to be very 'into' the breast milk idea. Ralph is raving about how delicious it it, almost as if it were a drug. He pushes it on people, pulling out the creamiest one and saying ""Just take one lick of that, it'll be the most delicious thing you've ever tasted, I promise"". Outside a club is a group of lads, drunk. They take an immediate dislike to us, and we try to leave, but one of them punches Ralph in the side of the head viscously and unprovoked. Bleeding, he runs to catch us up.",Negative
"I had someone come to the house to work on my plumbing. The drain in my upstairs bathroom was clogged. After he had finished his work he told me that I should not stand by the sink to brush my hair, because hair is what has caused the clog.

"I was in Vietnam firing at Americans on the ground from a tall 3- to 5-story wooden structure--not sure if Americans thought it was American or Vietnam. I hated them because they were rich and cruel. Suddenly, they took off in a helicopter and hovered near my window I had fired out of. I looked into the 'copter and saw about six male faces, stern and cruel, battle clothes, most without helmets. I felt they could fire or napalm me with ease. They hovered and hesitated even longer. Should I toss a hand-grenade in or hide under a bed? Dream stopped. No resolution.",Negative
"I'm supposed to go to a city on a plane - I'm running behind all the way. I live in a small frame house on a quiet little street in a neighborhood near the airport, with my stepmother and Dad and I supposemy brother - everybody's going out but Dad, and while I'm packing they all leave. (There was some question about whether Dad would leave too, and I think someone reminds him to lock the door.) I throw things in the suitcase and run on out to the bus stop. The bus stop is only a block or so away. It's dusk, getting later, and I get on a bus after a fidgety wait, and realize it's the wrong one. (I think; not sure about this point.) Also, I've opened the suitcase to refold something and found that I've forgotten very important things like a sweater or something to keep warm with, and I know I have to go back. I've got only half an hour, which is pretty desperate. I know I'll have to drive my car instead of taking the bus. Hadn't wanted to do that because I didn't want to pay to leave it at the airport, but maybe Dad can drive it back and I'll just have to trust him. (I hadn't before.) I know I've got to get off this bus right away, before I get too far to get home, so I throw stuff back in the suitcase and run to the front to stop the driver. Somehow I run back home (even though the case is heavy - perhaps I don't even have it). I go around to the back door first, hoping that either Dad's home or he's left it unlocked. (There seems to be something right in front of the door, which at first I thought was propping it open, but the door is shut.) It is unlocked - I turn the knob and go in, and he's on the couch in the living room watching TV. I run to get clothes, including a nightgown and slippers, and when I open the suitcase, I wonder about the typewriter that's in there. [This is my ex's old typewriter.] I don't really remember putting it there, and I don't think I really need it - after another moment or two I decide to take it out - it's heavy and I can get along much better without it. I check the time and find I've now got 20 minutes (or is it 10?). Things are getting pretty hairy. I am looking at a purple sweater or jacket that I wear with a T-shirt or something else short-sleeved, and find that I haven't got that because my brother's wearing it, which I don't appreciate. How inconsiderate of him to wear my shirt when I want it. Dadand I do get in the car and go on to the airport, but I don't know if I get there in time.",Negative
"Basketball Days Are Over  I'm at the Highland Pub, but it doesn't look like the actual pub. My acquaintances Eve and Julie Nichols are there. A man is coming to meet one of them, and everyone is excited. We are drinking a shot called a Lemondrop. A shot of lemon-ish liquid is put on the table and one has to suck or lick t off the table and then chase it with a lemon-flavored chaser in a glass with a straw. The man arrives and joins us. The biggest problem, I find, is not doing the shot itself, but having enough wind power to suck it all up off the table. My high school friend Nelson Eastman comes up: he is a waiter and is clearing the table. I'm with a man whom I'm friends with from high school; we both know Nelson and ask for free drinks. Nelson says he could probably help us, and asks how much we want to drink. I say as much as possible. When I say this I notice Nelson's boss has walked up behind him! Our attempt to get free drinks may be foiled. Nelson rolls his eyes as he walks away from his boss. We still may get free drinks if his boss didn't catch the gist of the conversation. I get up and walk around. The pub has quickly become crowded. The people I was sitting with have moved or left and others have taken over the table. I see my high school classmates Donald Dilson and Nathan Plumber. I walk around. A woman walks past me from behind and taps her fingers on my back as she does, indicating she doesn't like it when people do that to her: she thinks I walked past her and tapped her on the back a moment before. In fact, I didn't. It must have been a different man clandestinely hitting on her. I see a blondish woman at a table. I think I hear my name, but when I look she doesn't notice me. She looks a bit like my friend Sarah Reed or Helen Vader. I see my high school teammate Shawn Salzburg and his brother Brent, standing together next to a wall. I go talk to them. Both have long, stringy goatees, like mine, but about four to six inches long. Brent's is especially long. My teammate's father Greg Kulik is there with us. He is standing close, facing me. I jokingly pretend to knee him in the groin. After, I think that isn't the kind of personality I want to be displaying. I talk with the Salzburgs about basketball. Shawn says he's playing for the local youth hostel association. Brent's girlfriend yells at him because he's drinking and has a heart murmur: he could die. He says he's not on the drugs anymore, so he can drink. He is close to me, and I get specks of saliva in my face as he talks. I tell Shawn that my basketball playing days are over. While I talk with them I see a short stone bridge. It rises sharply in an arch over the water to be bridged.",Negative
"This dream involved guide dog school. Somehow I was at my parents' old house and we were sitting on the front porch and a lady came up and asked how did I get home every day, at what time did I get off the bus, then I said that I don't take the bus, once in a while I take the bus, but most of the time I don't take the bus, at first I couldn't remember how I got home and then I remembered that I took a taxi home, but somehow I couldn't figure out how I did that because somehow I was stuck at Redwood school, where I attended when I was a kid and it didn't seem to have anything to do with working. I knew that I usually walked to work like I do now and so I was all mixed up trying to answer her question, it seemed like an unusually difficult question, very confused. Then I was at guide dog school and there were all these people who it seemed were waiting to be evaluated for guide dogs. There must have bee 45 students all standing around asking questions and nobody was assisting them, and I wasn't there to get a guide dog, but I remember thinking, gee, what a disorganized school, to have these people standing around asking questions and not being seated in a room, being talked to about what to expect and what its going to be like. And then we were in this other place and it was really early in the morning and we had eaten breakfast and I was walking around and there was a lot of grass and a lot of opened space, and for some unknown reason, I had to get up early and I said that I was going to walk around down here, its so nice, it was a countryish setting and I was going to walk around.",Negative

"I have this visual of something that has different colored sections to it, various geometric shapes, and each has a black number on it. Whatever this thing was it was about the size of a typical jigsaw puzzle but it seemed to be part of a wall or hanging on a wall. A man has taken what I think is tissue paper like you would use in gift wrapping and laid it flat in each of these sections, matching the colors. The one that stands out in my mind is a green rectangle in the upper - middle section. It seems to be one of the more important ones. The point was to try to get people to do what they were supposed to do with each section. The man who put the tissue paper on it did it as much for himself as for the other people. Each section seemed to require some different type of action. He and I discussed the actions and it seems that I had either recommended he do the tissue paper thing or told him that I thought it was a good idea after he did it.",Negative

I hurried down again but he had gone outside. I went out on the sidewalk to look for him. It was rather dark outside. I went to a crowd in one direction and then in another. I called mother but there was no answer. Al last I knew they had all gone off in a car and forgotten me. So I went back in the hotel. Thought I might call the place we were going to and have someone return for me. Perhaps they would come back but maybe they thought I could come out on the bus.

I was getting extremely frustrated however because there was one part of it that I couldn't get to work the way I wanted it to. I kept trying over and over and over. There was a male named Mikey. I have this sense that I had seen something on TV in the dream. and that's where I saw Mikey. I was trying to incorporate something about Mikey in this document I was creating because I thought it would make this girl smile or laugh.

In going to fetch my coat I pass along a corridor almost to front door, and I notice, outside the building, a group of 8 or 10 people who seem to be waiting for the elevator, a bus, or some other conveyance. McBridge, I , and some third person decide we will make better time by going through the back door and taking a different elevator. I am wearing heavy, storm overshoes reaching half way to knees.

"I dreamed I was sitting in a dark car when an unidentified man opened the car door and asked me my views on the Republican and Democratic parties. I can't remember what I told him. The next thing I remember is picking up a copy of the Reader's Digest and discovering a two-page article about myself. The first paragraph of the article said that in an interview with me, it was found that I had 2/10 Presbyterian blood, a Presbyterian father and was psychologically and culturally a Presbyterian. The article then went on to describe my character. I was very angry and disgusted because of the false statements the magazine had made about me and furthermore I couldn't understand where they had received their information because the unidentified man had only asked me my views on the Republican and Democratic parties. I gave the article to Dottie, a friend of mine, to read. As she read it, I complained about the inaccuracies and lies that magazines and newspapers printed and how you couldn't believe what you read.",Negative
"I was outside and looked across the land and saw the clouds flying low. I went out and let some of the small clouds come to me like steam and they gave off a peculiar odor.

It looked at me ready to throw the rock. It went around the other side of the barn. I was walking across a small stream of water. I had to jump across when I went over it, then came back.

"We were sitting around the kitchen table when there was a knock at the door. It was late at night and we were startled for there are not many houses around us and not many of the people keep late hours. It was a peculiar knock--not like one people usually use. My father got up slowly and went to the door, opened it and saw the tramp. He immediately gave the screen door a push, the force of it sending the man reeling off the wide step onto the ground. My dad went out after him and a fight began. I was afraid he was going to hurt my father, so I picked up a knife and ran out the door. Mother following me. We stood there and watched the fight for a short time. Then, using the knife I held in my hand, I slashed at the tramp several times, until there was a great amount of blood on the ground. My father overcame the tramp, but being completely exhausted, he collapsed on the ground. Lying there, he appeared to have three hands. This woke me up. (The tramp was probably in his late 30's or early 40's.)",Negative

"Ellie and I went to a conference. We sleep together. I wake up and see Paulina, who had slept in her father's room, taking a shower. It looks like a good idea. I see a woman swimming past me, near the far wall. I'm surprised and wonder if there is water in the room. I sleep more. Paulina B gets into bed with me. I pretend I'm still asleep but enjoy the sweet hug she gives me. I hug her softly and pat her. She pats me back. I notice the difference between my feelings with Ellie and her. Ellie and I are always on edge with each other. Paulina and I exchange true feelings of loving each other. It's almost like she's my baby girl again. So now Ellie and I go to take a shower. The thing isn't very good. There are different nozzles and not much strength in the stream of water. Someone leaves the door open. A young teen boy comes in, rough and smart-mouthed. He has a scissor and threatens me. He rapes me. I have no feelings, even though I cry and sob and cry out, ""help"" and ""rape.""

I can detect the pulsating action that an erection has: how the ejaculate emerges in spurts. I can't give myself fellatio as well as others have given me fellatio.

We held the match together and jointly struck it and applied the flame to the candle wicks. But the flame kept going out and we had to strike several matches before we got the candles lit.

"I was in my home and heard much noise, as if someone was walking, stomping, or running on the roof. It was quite a commotion. I decided to go downstairs. To go downstairs I had to go through a square opening, the type you might find to enter an attic. The steps were more like a ladder. When I got down there it was almost like a cement maze. There were many people running around. There were plain-clothes police officers running frantically with guns. I crouched into a corner just as a police officer leaned against the wall over me and began shooting. A large group of men approached me, also trying to avoid being hurt, and crouched into the corner around me. We were being attacked by Russians. Some Russians found us and began shooting. It seemed that quite a few of the men around me were hit and some killed. At first, I thought they hit everyone but me and I thought about how there were enough men around me to keep me from being hit. At the same time, it almost seemed as though I had been hit also. I didn't feel any pain or anguish as I might have had I actually been hit. The next thing I know Matthew and I had been captured. We were assigned to sleeping quarters. Our sleeping quarters were oblong cement square holes in a wall. Each person had his or her own square. There was barely enough room to move. I was especially concerned about how tight it would be for me. They then gave us pajamas, or it may have been a uniform to change into. We were expected to change in our sleeping quarters. There was hardly room to move and there was no privacy. I tried putting mine on top of my other clothes and then removing my other clothes. Mine were too small so they gave me a larger set.

"The SVSDC was being expanded. They had remodeled all of the storage cabinets in the sleep area. They looked like kitchen cabinets. All of the doors were etched glass with white knobs. The cabinets were white. It was cool the way they were expanding the building. They had a forklift and they just lifted one of the walls and moved it out further. When I was walking around, there were quite a few patients standing around and two of them were in bed. One was Brandy C. I asked someone if she was having another sleep study. I was standing at this sink cleaning out something that was shaped like a lint roller but it was metal and had holes and things sticking out of it. It had some really goopy stuff in it and I was standing there gagging as I was cleaning it. Anne Marie [unknown in waking life] was standing on the other side of the sink facing me and told me that it's just mucus. There was also this other woman standing to my right. It was a woman from ER. The one that sponsors Carter but I can't remember her name. She was more sympathetic. I wouldn't even say what it was that I was cleaning out. Then I had this piece of meat, maybe a steak, while I was standing there at the sink. I wanted to lay it down and wanted someone to grab a plate for me. Instead this other woman laid a huge piece of raw salmon on the counter and I laid the steak on top of it. I had put a bunch of Rolodex cards into a Rolodex and it was overflowing. They didn't want to buy another one so I went to the sleep area to see if I could find another one in storage. While I was back there, I started talking to Susan J. We were both complaining about things they had done back there. They didn't want us to spend money on office supplies but yet they had all the cabinet doors replaced with this expensive engraved glass. I also noted that all of the cabinets had kitchenware like glasses and plates instead of the normal sleep center supplies. I had an idea about what I could do for the Rolodex. I saw this three-sectioned container on the desk that could be readjusted and made into a Rolodex so I went back to the office to try that. I was talking to one of the construction workers about the expansion. I said, pretty soon, we're going to be all the way out to the road.

"I was with a large gathering of people my own age, most of whom I did not know. (Both sexes were present.) One of the boys was injured in some way. It was a boy (age 22) I had recognized as having been stationed at Ft. while I was there. I only knew him by sight. To my knowledge I was the only graduate nurse in the group so I did what I could to determine the nature of his injury & make him comfortable. However, there was a student nurse present who pushed forward & ""took over the show."" I, more or less submitted & stood by the sidelines. The ambulance & doctor arrived - & transported the boy to the hospital on a plank. The only symptom he seemed to have was a swelling, redness, tautness of the 3rd finger on his left hand. It was believed that he had a spinal injury.  The scene changed to a hospital ward. Another nurse (same age) and I were with the patient. The doctor had just left, after arranging some pillows & blankets under the boy's back. Miss D. (32) a supervisor in Nursing arts, with whom I had previously worked came into the room & asked why the pillows had been arranged in such a fashion.

At first I was worried that I would never find my friend, but when I found her I was happy.",Negative
In my dream I was trying to buy colored blocks to fit into a wall panel I was able to buy and fit all the blocks except one with out which the whole design would fall apart. Interpretation The general plan of the dream may have come from the difficulty I have had working with the panel in a radio cabinet J. and I are building or a game of chinese checkers I played before going to bed. The one block that wouldn't fit was probably an expression of an Id impulse against the formal design. Answers to questions 2. The dream was frustrating3. Actual participant4. Neither5. An art room6.

She had always wanted to help but she was concerned and asked if it was coming out readable and I said ""yes."" I was reading it with my fingers and it was okay, there were some reversals but I could still figure it out so I didn't tell her that I couldn't figure it out, she had reversed a lot of Es and Is but I didn't say anything.

I ask one of the pairs if the jeeps can take three people, and I was told that they could, with one person in the ""rumble seat.""

"Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town and we were doing a number of different things. But Terri was also there, and Terri knew how to play guitar, and in my dream Terri knew somebody else before she knew Don, and she was getting together with somebody else and falling in love with that person again. And she was at our house and she was kind of playing for us a little bit, and Samantha, Sandra and Derek were kind of partying around. And for some reason I was laying on the pallet in front of Dad's desk and I was like opening the drawer to Dad's desk, shuffling around until I found my tape machine and hitting ""record"" so that I could record what was going on. Well, instead of recording, it just played. It just played whatever was on the tape, and it was kind of a little on the wild side, and Samantha was sitting right there on the chair next to me and could see everything I was doing. And then we were walking in the park and I dreamt that I had a watch that could record what was going on too, and in order to get the sound ________ phone and that was really a bad deal! [laugh] But then at the end Sandra was saying to Dad how they were going to introduce me to one of their friends, but they weren't going to do it tonight, it was probably going to be too late. ""I think we should do it tomorrow,"" is what she was saying. And I was all set and ready to do it that night, but I said, ""We only have a few days; let's make the most of them.""

"I am doing a group hypnosis in a church, probably the church I attended as a child. We have moved the pews so they are in a diagonal line. People are laying in the pews to be hypnotized and I am upstairs in the choir loft looking down on them. I can't seem to get started because of interruptions. Two girls are there talking about prom dresses. One is pregnant. The other girl is one I thought would be more likely to get pregnant than the one who is. A pink prom dress is hanging on a door. The pews get wet, like from rain, and have to be dried off and we start all over again. Then the priest comes in and doesn't say anything about the hypnosis but I feel he is going to say something so I order everyone to straighten out the pews. The experiment is over.",Positive

"I was undercover. I was a cop, and I was pretending to be an undercover prostitute to try and get a job with some bad guys. One of them was actually good and he was Tobias (Arrested Development). I told him to act like he thought I was a cop. Then I was in a hotel room and I was sharing with a girl. She put on some nail polish and I said it was gross. It was a dark, but bright, pink. I was telling her about my job as a prostitute. Then it showed the bad guys talking and Tobias was telling them I was a cop. They discovered I was a prostitute and they offered me a job in their operation. Then I was watching Arrested Development and Lindsay looked like she was covering up because she was naked but Tobias had called for help because they were both naked. She moved and covered herself on the floor? She said ""one fell"" and Tobias said ""I told you to tell me if I fell"". Her boob was hanging out and was blurred. I walked to a big building which was huge and empty and like a school gym. People were there and we were told to gather. As I was walking in, someone said ""Did anyone have sex with Duran Duran before they split up?"". We all sat down and there was a video of all of us saying funny quotes. A girl was in a toilet and her friend said 'We're going to be late and Chris Potter is cute' and she was shocked at this? Some guys, one of them was Samm Levine, went into a toilet. There were some chemicals -- some worm things? They were on me and made me itch, so I was flicking them off and it was annoying. My quote clip was from outtakes of Castle. Kate was at a pub or something with a black woman. She said her line muddled and Kate teased like ""Who I be phone?"" and laughed, no-one in the room made a sound. I was thinking that I didn't even say that often. There was a new movie and it started with this teenage guy in a car. It was wet and the car was covered in bits of ear and blood. The guy had blood on him too. He woke up and was trying to remember what happened. There was a flashback -- it was 'underwater' and this girl asked ""what's your name"", and I said ""Izzy"". She said ""there's a shark to your 'shaft'"". We turned and I swam and the shark ate her and kept going. Then there were octopuses that had been after him. They were saying that because of the flashbacks, it was more likely to believe the situation because we knew he had survived.",Negative
"I was going to some kind of a concert show thing at school and Melinda and I were in the auditorium with the sound person. And he was showing us this light-up light system where the lights light up, and they'd like turn blue and the theater floor would actually like tip back and forth and back and forth to the rhythm of whatever was going on. And then the strobe light part would turn on and it would just go all out of control, and hopefully nobody was up walking around at that time, because they'd just fall down. And then we went out of the auditorium and we each had rooms there that we were staying in -- it wasn't really a hotel, but it was a place where people could stay. And I was looking for the bathroom, and I found it and I went in, and it was like this real loud engine motor thing in there, kind of like when you go in a plane bathroom. And then I was in my room, which looked like my room here. Oh, I know why we were staying there. We were staying there because we were going to take the SAT. Dad said, ""Call the office on the intercom and see if the SAT was ready to start any time soon."" And so I looked around and didn't see a thingy. Then, I spotted one way at the top. So I got the stool out of my closet, and I climbed up there and buzzed the office, and there was no reply, and then I woke up.",Positive
"I went to school and we were doing Drama. Steve asked me, Melissa and Liz to sing in front of everybody. I don't like sitting in front of people so I sort of mouthed it: Then Steve, the Director, said Great! Liz, you're cast as Juliet, Melissa, you're cast as Lady Capulet, and Kelly, you're cast as the nurse. I felt cheated. I cried and said ""I never even auditioned for the parts."" Steve said that Melissa could sing the song in the play. I didn't even want the part of the nurse. I wanted Juliet. Setting: It took place at the stage (where) we usually had our performing night at school. It also took place at school. Characters: Steve is the director and the middle school head, and plays heavy favorites. Liz is a really popular ""strong"" actress, she never fells (sic) the parts.

When I leave the record store, it is about 8:00, and I discover that I have forgotten the Gogi Grant record.  I go back and ask for it.  I see it in a little adjoining room, on a shelf.  The clerk goes in and gets it for me (or so I believe).  When I leave again, however, I discover she has given me the wrong one, and so I go back again.  I am getting really nervous as I watch the hands of the clock move.  The store is open, but the clerk is not there, and the place feels mysterious.  I look frantically everywhere but can't find the record.  Somehow I get Sharon.  We were supposed to see South Pacific, but it is already about 9:30.  Then, either at the shop or at Jimmy Creagar's house-the former, I think-I find a man and a woman dead and each slumped across a chair.

"I was at a shop but then I was in a hall at a house and it kept going back and forth. I was dating Robert Sheehan and his name was something else and his last name was Brown, but he was basically Dmitri from Misfits without a power. I thought someone was following me and I screamed and he came but there was no-one there. Then we were at a shop. We found this pile of dead bodies in this toilet cubicle. This guy who looked like Ben Mendelsohn was an old friend of someone in our group and was an interior designer. We ended up getting attacked by a killer. They had these leprechaun/elf things. They had a few powers and we went to run outside and Dmitri grabbed some chocolate mints. There was a car that would only run if you were eating chocolate mints. We were waiting for it to register us eating them and the leprechaun things were coming closer. It finally started and I was driving (though I was in the middle of the backseat and was reaching over. We went to this beach and there were heaps of people and they all turned around. We ended up getting out of the car and they attacked us again. Later we were at a party and this guy mentioned the Ben Mendelsohn guy and this guy said 'oh yeah, I remember [different name], he's a [different career]' and we were confused. He went over and said 'sorry about the divorce' and Ben was like 'yeah, I came out 5 years ago'. Later, he was married to this guy and then realised he was straight. He kept talking and then he realised we caught him out as the 'goblin king'. We trapped him in the car and said 'in 2 minutes there's going to be a car accident and you're going to die'. We left and he just sat there. This guy who was the brother of someone in the car (which was a 4WD) was driving towards it. Ben 'teleported' out of the car and in front of the guy driving towards it and stopped it. This caused him to kill these other people because he now had control of him. He shot down these dancing kids and their parents.",Negative

"Digging A Hole At Fishing Haven  I'm on Fishing Haven property, on the 15-Mile property on the hill side of the driveway. I'm back in the woods 50 feet from the driveway digging a hole with a shovel. I move leaves, dirt, and lots of worms. I have branch clippers too. A person is coming up the driveway. I see only their legs under the tree branches at first, and then he or she comes into view. It's a young man with a short red beard. At first I think it's my old roommate Sean Williams. I say hi, friendly, and then see it's my former boss Mike Hollow. He tells me to move my things and pick up the clippers and leave. I show him that the cardboard box I was digging from isn't on some plants, which is why he told me to move it. I ask him why he doesn't respect people. He replies with a question about my respect for him. I know I did maintain respect for him until he became unworthy of it. I walk down the path to the driveway. Mike follows slowly. I tell him that in his dream the skeleton is a part of him, and if he doesn't know that by now he must be pretty ignorant. He doesn't respond, but acts stern and silent, like he knows best. I can't find the clippers, and ask Mike in a friendly manner, which is quite an abrupt shift from my stern words a moment earlier, if they are back near the trail. He doesn't answer. I think I must have walked by them.",Positive
"I was in Sarasota. I had gone back to art school. I found a place across the street in a Sr. Citizens apartment complex. At first my next door neighbors were 2 young gay men They had a Christmas tree that should have been taken out a long time ago. It was shedding needles all over the place. I took it out to the fire escape/balcony. ??? In a little closet, a hide-away ironing board was hanging in the closet. Now I had 2 ladders. The guys had a dog I walked sometimes. School was gonna start. My mother was there to fix the place up and make it look like a home. I did not like what she did. I'd rather have no furniture than the furniture she picked out. My hair had turned very light. I looked in the mirror. It was almost white. My mother had filled the bag with church shoes. I did not want them. A man came and said I took a pair of shoes out of a brown bag--I thought they were mine but they weren't. I looked back. First I had ignored him a long time. I said, ""They're mine."" I was in the water of the ocean with all the shoes beside me. Dora was sitting in the water with me. I was putting on and taking off the shoes when they were washed up.

I felt around the bottom and found first one shoe, then the other--when I had found both shoes underwater--I looked up and the tide had come in deep--it was carrying Dora out to sea.",Positive
"I'm at a LT event - probably WOW - a resort, somewhere a place out in the woods, anyway. I've been in a room with some old people and we've gone down to a room where another thing is going on (this is very disjointed). Not everybody who's attending is in this room - this is not a set part of the program, precisely; it's not like anything we normally do. There is someone leading; it's night, probably quite late, and there may be 30 or 50 people in here (I'm not sure - maybe not that many, but there's a lot). Something is finished, which is the reason that not everybody is together, and the guy who's leading decides to try something - it's a kind of meditation, we're going to lie down on these benches that are here, and do something; I did not quite get that at first and so I'm standing up, doing something, talking to somebody, for a bit while everybody else is rearranging themselves. Then when I see that they're all lying down, it turns out that there isn't room for me on any of the benches that are here. I go into another room to find something. I kinda thought there was a bench of this sort in the room I just came from. We go down there and somebody's there - it's not precisely a bedroom, but there is a bed in here, and somebody is there talking on the phone, I think - I look around, look beside the bed and the wall and don't find the bench that I thought was there - I think somebody's already thought to get it and take it down there. Come back down the hall, and I go into the room that's opposite the one where everybody else is, and poke around there. There's a number of kinds of things in here, and one of them looks as though, if you folded it right, it might be a bench that you could lie on. It's kind of like water skis or something - it's definitely sports equipment. The pieces are narrow, long, have markings on them like sports equipment does, stripes, numbers, etc. They're attached end to end and there's some hinges, like you could fold the things some way or other. I fool with it for a bit and get it to stand up, the way a bench would, and discover that the hinges are the wrong way to do this - or at least I haven't figured out how it is - so it won't stand up if you were to try to lie on it. I go back into the other room, then, to see what I can do - maybe just lie down on the floor.",Negative

Am not certain it is really a road or just someone's driveway, although it is rather wide for a driveway. It is black asphalted and I stop the car just after the turn, undecided whether to go ahead or not. The road disappears into the trees and a short distance ahead a man is standing square in the middle of the road and looking ahead at me. I sit in the car and wait and he stands and watches. No action. Finally he moves a few steps aside and I drive ahead. As I pass him, note he is middle-aged, heavy-set. I drive on and on and finally into an open area.

"The dream takes place on an airplane, and this young woman has found a gadget that looks like a coffin and also like a big freezer display cabinet. And she's realized that this is some kind of device that puts you into suspended animation while you're in it, although you're still fairly aware of things going on around you. And she climbed into this gadget, as a way of getting into the country we're flying to -- which I think is Sweden -- for free because she thinks she'll be mistaken for a body that's being shipped back to Sweden. I and a number of other people are in one of the forward compartments of the plane, and the young man who's traveling with us goes back to the baggage compartment to look for someone else who's -- well, he goes back to look for this young woman, and he sees her through the glass panels of this coffin device, and he tells her that he realizes that she's not dead. And they get into some sort of argument. Then there's some action I don't recall very well, and then in the next part of the dream these devices have been discovered by people, and there are now many, many of them throughout the world, and more and more people are getting into these things and staying there for the most part. And I'm very upset by it, cause it looks like the whole world is going back to the womb, and it's worse than TV.

And something happens at the check-out counter: we get shortchanged, or the manager's discourteous to us, or something. And I get rather mad.

There were two for me -- there were cushions inside with a sticker saying 'you suck' on them (and no to the job obviously). I went to university, which was different. It looked like a mansion thing. A lady said university was closed -- it was Easter Monday (which she called 'good Monday') and I'd forgotten it was closed that day. I went back home and realised I was working today at Cannington. It was almost 4pm and I started hurrying to get ready and told Mom and Darren I was leaving for Cannington and they were like 'oh god, you're going to be late' but I said I started at 5.30pm and they said 'oh you have plenty of time' [IRL, I'm working at Cannington tonight]. People on the forum were giving me directions. Quizzleygirl said there'd be a sign saying 'Quizzleygirl's 4[km]' and to turn there and the rest of it would be on foot. I did so.

The Doctor hinted it was The Master again. Then I was his companion and was saying he couldn't kill him and there was a dead bird and the Doctor looked vengeful but picked up the bird and it came back to life; suggesting what he'd do to the Master.

I prance around saying that over and over, and then as an afterthought, I say, ""And no more germs from outside this room too,"" meaning if I go outside, I don't want to catch any germs there either. It's a way of protecting us.",Negative
"I was working in the post office. There was a Jewish girl. She kind of was stuck on me and I was intimating her every once in a while. Carter filled his pants and he was holding them a certain way and yelled for me to come and see it. He yelled at John. I came into the shop and Kugler was working.

"I think I was at the Technical College which was different. I was in this building with a young boy and girl who were brother and sister (around 5/6 years old). The boy's left eye was fake.  Some kind of fight/war started happening and we shut the curtains and closed the door to hide. We saw people getting rounded up outside. We heard them coming into the building and ran upstairs. We had to jump out of a window and I went first. They jumped next and the girl landed on the spiky stuff that goes on fences which was all over the ground. The boy hurt himself landing and his fake eye started coming out so he took it out and gave it to his sister to look after. There was a gap between buildings and I looked and saw soldiers. We waited for a bit and looked again and no one was looking this way so we ran across. Later I was by myself and snuck into this massive house. I hid in a room and some of my clothes were there. Some other people came to hide too, one was a gay dude and he saw the closet of the guy who lived there and it was really flamboyant and he wanted it. The guy (who was quite old) caught him later and I hid in the cupboard and the gay guy had sex with him to distract him. The wife came home later and we snuck out and left.",Negative

"I was at home. I was with Farrah and Ezra had Roland over. Dad was home. Every time we went into my room something was different and it was spooky. There was a piece of paper (like paper from a magazine) which was an application for a concert. It said ""Michael Cain"" and I figured it meant Michael Caine and said it was spelt wrong. One of the times I went into my room there was a new sheet on my bed but when I tried to show someone it was gone. The bed was in the middle of the room, coming out from the wall. Stuff moved around, like the lights etc. I was at the window and Farrah was doing something that I can't read but says that she slowed down for something. Also, Farrah was sometimes Tara from True Blood. Another time she found an old notebook of mine and it had the original copy of the magazine application and we showed Dad. Then I went to Brookland High to do something before going to university. It was a Friday by the way. I went to a room at the back of the school, where the psychologist was, who was a lady but was sometimes a guy. While I was waiting I was talking about a dream I'd had. She asked if it any religious stuff and I said no and told her to not mention religion. A while later I checked the time and it was 11.30 and I was like 'flip, I missed it' and text Mom to get me. Then the psych was a guy. His mates came and he said 'another [something] dream'. I saw Mom's car and took off. She yelled at me for not telling her sooner. Ezra and Roland were in the back. Then it was just me and Mom. We heard a siren and it meant there was a storm coming. There were clouds in the sky but were far away.",Negative

One of the birds is of a reddish color and I wish to get close enough to identify it. I therefore carefully sneak along, keeping a tree between me and the bird. There is another tree, ""E,"" off to the right, which has a single long limb projecting over toward tree D, but I am confident the reddish bird is not on this limb. Though it seemed that my stalking was done skillfully, and I saw no birds leaving, I was unable to locate anything except a single robin.

So he and another guy, who I can't quite identify at the moment, come by and pick me up in a car and we drive over to this restaurant and go in. We already got some hamburgers as soon as we get there, which are part of our meal, and then we go on and order some other stuff on the menu and we start talking about the advantages of not being married, and I'm joking with them because I don't think too much of the advantages.",Positive

I still insisted she should just let them alone.",Negative
I was driving my wife's automobile down one of the more busy streets in Cleveland. What street it was I cannot tell although I am very familiar with the municipal thoroughfares of Cleveland. Snow blanketed the ground and the streets shone like glass. Suddenly the car went completely out of control and a dense fog appeared before my eyes through which I could see oncoming headlights but nothing else. Everything appeared to be gray and the car began turning complete circles as rapidly as a whirling dervish. Vainly I attempted to get the car under control but the more I tried the more the car spun. I began getting sick to my stomach and waited for an accident to occur but nothing happened. I heard horns blaring and people shouting but from whence they came I knew not. The car stopped spinning and I woke up happy to discover that it was only a dream.,Negative
I am with a large crowd of high school kids at a party in the woods. A bad crowd comes there and the good kids hide. The bad kids find them. One of the good kids manages to get the message that they need to help some other good kids who walk by and look in through a window. A flood happens as bad things begin to happen when the bad crowd catches them. One girl's father won't save her because she isn't a virgin so it is not worth the effort. The good kids get rescued and return to school which is like a house with a big open circular staircase. I become one of the kids. I can't quite make it to the top. Then I am wrapping a package and there is not quite enough wrapping to finish. For most of the dream I am an observer - not a participant.,Positive

"I was at Nana's for Christmas Eve. The lounge room was slightly different and Dad and Ezra were down there, along with Eugene and his brother Rodney. I wondered how they knew them. We were watching TV and I moved to sit on the floor next to the TV. We had all been talking together and I was wondering how to 'get in' with him. Later, I was in the house alone and I was just sitting on a step and I looked up and Eugene was in the hall and I said he scared me. Then I walked out and went into this new room and everyone was in there. I sat in the corner on a seat next to Poppa and Ezra. Eugene joined me. Then we were in another room and Ezra and I had a huge fishtank each. He had a piranha and I had a normal fish. There were big groups of little fish for the piranha to eat and it was practically jumping out of the tank. Ezra got it and put it in my tank by mistake. I freaked out and got a net and tried to fish it out, then he tried and managed to catch it and put it back. Then my tank was low on water. I ran to get Poppa. There was a rabbit cage which had a little pipe. I said 'they're going to die!' and he quickly got a hose and filled it up. Ezra's was going down too. We had to raise the tank and it was full and started to spill. Poppa was also impersonating the Marx brothers at one point.",Negative

I distinctly see a white band holding hair back. Father Andrew is himself again. We are walking down a street that is brilliantly lit up, with balloons and many people. It is like an Easter parade! He is wearing white-yellow robes and he has an arm about me. As we walk, we talk about how to teach children: ""I am deeply committed to the fact that children do not just learn visually."" I almost shout; he smiles and I remove my arm, but he still holds me, almost upholds me. ""That is why I am in the Church, because when they see you do this--give Communion--then they really learn!""

"I had left my office for a few minutes and when I returned there was a message for me on my desk written on a piece of white paper. The handwriting was barely legible but I could make out the message.  Mary had called while I was out but she would call me again at 4:00 pm. There was a phone number where she could be reached. I did not know whether to call her right away or wait until she called me at 4:00 pm. But I wanted to know who had taken the message and opened the door of my office to see if I could find the message taker. When I opened the door I was looking into a very large open-spaced office filled with very many desks. No one was there, except, several desks away and directly in front of me were Jerry Seinfeld, Elaine, and Kramer or George huddled around a desk. When I opened my door they just looked at me indifferently then went back to their discussion. I shut my door, returned to my desk and went on wondering whether to call Mary now or wait for her call. There were a number of plates and bowls in my office that more appropriately belonged in a kitchen. I woke up before deciding what to do about calling Mary.",Negative
"I dreamt I was on my computer.  The room was dark, and my brother Stuart was sitting on the toilet across the hall with the door open.  Something felt ominous, but I'm not sure what.  I was trying something new out, like a Winamp skin.  The screen splashed red, except for where the title letters left a vacancy.  The two halves of the screen turned slightly, forming two corners of cubes, protruding 3 inches from the monitor.  I turned and called Stuart to look, it was so realistic.  I felt as though I was supposed to succumb to the stereotype of trying to touch the 3-D image.  I reached through one of the corners, and once I penetrated the image, I felt heat.  My finger quivered.  High radiation?  I touched it again and got nervous.  It was too weird.  I wanted to back away.  I woke up with my throat and breathing constricted.",Negative

My mom drove me down to the place where I get my bus. There were a couple of 7th graders standing at my stop, where they usually are. I could swear to myself that I needed to put on makeup, but everyone told me that I looked fine. I wanted to put makeup on, but there was always something stopping me. I got on the bus and went to school. Then I woke up. I remembered my dream as soon as I woke up. I was afraid because I thought I went to school with no makeup on.",Negative
"I and some other Americans are on the cliff face trying to find a treasure or something valuable. The Russian crew is following us, watching, perhaps video taping us. We pretend the treasure isn't there and go on looking at another spot. Then we rush back to the original spot. Now a Russian team on the opposite canyon wall throws a basketball. This is a challenge. I manage to catch it and say to the Russians near us, on our side of the cliff, ""See! ONE! One point."" I am being victorious because the score is being kept in American language, not Russian. I now try to throw the ball. It is heavy and I don't get it airborne very much. It falls, I see a poof of smoke and then someone else on my side almost catches it.",Negative

I go into a room and a fun ride is there. I want to go on it, so I sit down on the dresser. There should be a basket like thing to sit in, but it's not there. A woman goes and gets a wire basket, white, and places it so I can put my feet in it and have better support that way. The ride begins and it is actually fun as the dresser swirls and twirls around the room. It is more exciting than I usually experience with this kind of ride.",Positive
"I was at home - though it was different and I lived with Dad and Ezra. We were in the lounge room watching TV and sleeping out there. I can't remember exactly what happened, but I think a sniper shot through the window at us. We had some kind of idea who it was, but I don't know why or who. I ran out into the bushes outside (it was a house in the middle of the bush, though it was still sort of local). People were chasing me and I kept running and was running over buildings and stuff. They almost caught me a few times, but I kept escaping. I ended up at this factory thing, I think it was for ice-cream or something, but it had been abandoned for years. When I went in though, it was still running which I thought was odd. I think I was then with someone else and we were trying to hide from the people and escape the building. We eventually left through the front door and there was a group of people outside. Then we ended up in this neighbourhood and broke into a house. I can't remember why we were in there and I think we were hiding from people in the house, but then it was just us two. Outside a kid and an older guy approached the house and were looking through the windows and apparently had seen us. I crept around to the back and left through a window. I climbed up this hill behind it and crept along the fence. They were walking away and I walked onto the road behind them but they saw me and then I thought that was stupid. I asked where the train station was and they pointed and I acted grateful and like nothing was up. I met up with my friend and we got on the train. The kid and the guy had followed us and sat on the opposite side of the train. I think they questioned us about what we were doing there and I said I was their niece (the wife was called Olive, can't remember the husband). Then we had actually met up with them at the house, but we were involved in something dodgy and I think there was some orgy or something, so they hadn't answered the door when the kid was there. They called the people and they confirmed that they knew us, but they still seemed suspicious. I was trying to work out what my next disguise would be and I chose a green wig, which I had worn before and had a fondness for.",Negative
"A woman with at least a couple of kids lives in a Dickensian sort of tenement and gets thrown out because she can't pay the rent. It's tough but not the first time or the worst thing that could happen. We go along to another place where the landlord is more generous and frankly this place is nicer and in better condition than the last anyway. It looks rustic - landlord leads us round to our entrance and inside, where there's an intricate stair arrangement - I think of England, where there can be found these very shallow steps that turn and twist but there's even more here - you don't actually need to take them, you can leap several. We go up that way, rather than following the line back and forth. Also I'm on a bus going to a shopping center. Lots of people on, and I'm sitting all the way in the back. I get a phone call. I'm not surprised that there's a phone, but I think it's rather a disturbance and didn't expect them to actually have me take the call here. It's a girl who also works for the City and I don't really understand what she wants but she obviously thinks I'm in the office and is a little bit annoyed to find that I'm not. Also perplexed - we don't know each other and there's some doubt that she's even got the right number. The bus arrives at the shopping center and there's an Army-recruit thing going on in the parking lot. Turns out there's a lot of new recruits on this bus and they're meant to get off and join their group, so we have to wait a bit while that gets organized. I get off - speak to somebody but don't remember what about except that there's a question whether I'm one of them.",Negative

She had to prove something and went to give them the CD but it was gone. She went into a bedroom with a bunk bed to have a shower (she thought the shower was under the top bunk, but it wasn't). She found something that said ""only Jason Lee!"". It was from some colourful video game. Then Liz was in a car at a shop. She was trying to put L plates on while she was parked in the car park. She saw these two girls and she thought they were going to steal the plates so she locked the doors and took them off. She had to go inside and took the car with her (it was small and she was holding it in her arms). This lady gave her car stuff.

"I had a date with a boy (who is 30, a friend of a girlfriend of mine) for lunch. As I was going downtown I noticed that his pants legs swept the ground and his overcoat dipped way down in back. This embarrassed me. Then we went into a lobby to buy some theater tickets. This lobby was much like a small town railroad station. I was sitting on one of these wooden benches inconspicuously with many other people when this boy went up to the desk to get the tickets. As he reached under his coat to pull his wallet out of his back pocket, I saw that he had a thick corset laced over his pants. Everyone laughed. I sneaked out of this lobby and into another one. I was so embarrassed. I met another boy there who told me that he was a friend of this first boy, and the whole incident had been an initiation stunt.",Negative
"I was returning to a former nursery school I once worked in, as a teacher again. Only the children who were assembled as a class, I recognized as the children I have in my present nursery job. It was a period following a long vacation and I couldn't get the children's attention. I began a story and the next thing I knew the children were running all around a large grassy playground. Then I would chase them together again and try to begin the story. Next I was at a rehearsal of the Cleveland Symphony. I was there to conduct the orchestra in Beethoven's 5th Symphony. Szell, the conductor, showed me the score and then he left. The first page of the score was words only, no music, and I was perplexed. I turned the page, lifted up my right arm and began to conduct. It sounded terrible, as the players, who said they knew it so well, played without music. I had to stop several times and once I reprimanded the piccolo player for not coming in on time. Szell returned and yelled at some of the players. The players told me secretly when he left that they were playing poorly because they didn't like Szell. Leaving in defeat, my husband begins to conduct and do a good job. I woke up and remembered part of the melody of that 5th Symphony. I heard the entire symphony in my dream.",Negative

"I was standing on our upstairs back porch watching some sort of an air show in the sky. Although it was night, I could see a blimp in its entirety, silver-colored, and a legend or advertisement or news bulletins running around it. I squinted and peered to try to read what it was, but could not.  There were several airplanes sky-writing, and doing it in a very graceful sweeps across the sky. I also tried to read what they were writing, but the smoke evaporated or disintegrated before I could read the words.  In spite of all this aerial activity, there was no noise. I then became cold and sat in the corner of the porch, huddled up, trying to keep warm. Interpretation Earlier in the evening of the dream I had seen the Goodyear blimp which has lately been floating over C. at night, flashing news reels along its side in Times-Square fashion, so, obviously, that is where the ""dream blimp"" came from.  My not being able to read it probably springs from the fact that I am near--sighted and would not be able to see it without my glasses. I have noticed in other dreams, however, when trying to read a book the print sort of melts away before I can see what it says.  The sky-writing of the planes, which was fluffy, pastel-colored stuff, may have come from a package of shipping-cream dye I had bought that day. And I awakened shortly after the dream to find I had kicked the covers off, which explains my feeling cold in the dream. Answers to questions 2. Mildly perplexed and frustrated at not being able to read the sky-writing3. Both, really. A participant who was also an onlooker4. Pleasant5. The upstairs back porch which is off my bedroom.6. No7.

Instead houses, there were just charred ruins and their remains. He said something had happened that did all this damage but in the dream, it wasn't specified. I thought to myself, in the dream, that Negroes had moved into these houses and reduced them to the remains that they now were.",Positive
Annie Starts Her Period  I'm with My girlfriend Annie at a truck-stop-like exit off the freeway. There is lady and her son there too. Annie tells me that she was sitting in her room last night and she started menstruating. I think that she always menstruates when we spend time together after a long time apart. We are talking about doing something that night.,Positive
I am living in a tall building and I am snowbound. I am sitting by a heat register looking out a window. One leg is cold and when I look it has frozen and split open. My boyfriend from high school and a female neighbor/friend I grew up with are there visiting. I'm sitting on his knee. My parents are also there. We go in and out the window of the top floor of the tall building. My parents and some man leave. My father jumps. I yell at my mother not to do it too. She says something about not looking down and then takes the ladder down.,Negative
"Something about Freda L. There is a man that she was very interested in and she thought that I was interested in him also. Or, she thought I was trying to get him interested in me before she had a chance to get him interested in her. Maybe she thought I was trying to ""steal"" him from her. She looked very different than she does in waking life. Also something about my birth home. I was trying to get into the attic. There was so much stuff everywhere, including on the door that I was having a very difficult time opening it.",Negative
"I had some mail and it was my proof of age card. The envelope was big and was full of other stuff. The photo on the card was stupid. My mouth was open, but it had three mini photos and my main photo was me on a 3/4 angle with the front of my face over the top. I called Mom to complain but I couldn't get through. I tried to call the DPI but I kept getting disconnected. I went for my walk with Ezra. We went across the road and there was a lemur. I called out ""There's a lemur eating Ezra's head!"". It tried to get me, so we ran. It was bouncing around. I was then watching something. There was a boy and he opened the door and there was a creepy scarecrow and I screamed.",Negative
"Wet River Flight  I'm going to the airport. I am near a river area with docks. I fall in the water. I have forgotten my boots and other things. I'm going to check in at the airport, and get on a plane. I have a booklet-like folder that contains my tickets. A man slides a transparency up against the book and matches tickets. There is a man who wants to give me my passport in Los Angeles. I say, ""No way!"" My high school classmate, John Stromer, is there, and he tries to get on the plane. The man won't let him on, and he ends up at a counter where I am.",Positive
"Roller Skate Policewoman  There is a woman who is picked up and transported with a laser by three alien people. She has a gun and is on roller skates. She seems to be a police officer. The laser moves her to another place where she keeps acting as if she were in the first place. She falls into a water drainage area, and gets pulled into a big water tunnel. The woman is a partner with Arnold Schwarzeneggar. Arnold is at the gymnasium with his adversary, competing by doing one-legged jumping calf raises. He gets a phone call. It is the woman, his partner.",Positive
"Charlton Heston and his son are captured. So am I. We are put in a zoo. We are in a pool swimming back and forth like the polar bears. I understand how the bears feel, bored, angry, hopeless. Then we escape and run through the forests. The bad guy that wants us dead owns a shop and we go in and look at the merchandize - black boxes, shiny enamel, huge puppet dolls, tiny miniatures. I'm interested in the minis. He's telling people he'll sell the big things at a discount, so he'll have room for more things. We realize he's after us and escape as we go up a hill. We see he has cannons bombing the village we left. People are dying because he's trying to kill us. We go to another village and steal a small child's chair and go under a table to hide. A woman is already there and is angry at us. She insists we leave. We do and now are in the tree tops swinging from one branch to another! He'll never find us, but we'll be on the run and alone forever. Charlton hands me a life saver. I say, ""Do I have bad breath?"" He says yes. A woman says, ""He didn't think it would be so easy to tell you."" Then she tells me to take a bath. ""I really stink?"" I ask. She says, ""Yes. Terribly. I'd be inundated with waves of the smell, especially the hope, waves of hope. Disgusting.""",Negative
"I was at some large gathering like a picnic, in the middle of a large field; as a matter of fact, it was near the Fairgrounds in my hometown, because I remember pointing out the ""Golden Thriller"" statue to Bonita.  We didn't know our way around very well, and decided we could guide on that statue as a reference point to get where we wanted to go.  Anyway, at some point, we were all in cars in the middle of this big field.  It was damp and rainy, and we may have been just getting in out of the rain, or we may have been preparing to leave.  On my home, though, either then or later, I was on foot.",Negative
"There was an assessment thing and something called Cubance. There was an excursion. On the bus, the teacher was choosing people to meet some celebrities. I remember Calvin and Silas got picked. We went to this 'hotel' place, except it wasn't a hotel. The people who got picked were allowed somewhere special. These people snuck me into the place because Calvin wanted to talk to me. Then I was in a car with Mom and it was night time. These people broke into somewhere. And there were weird religious people.",Negative
"It was going to be cold so I was going to wear pants but I decided to wear a jumper instead. I went to school and I had an English assignment due in. That period, we had to film a music video and we had lunch 1 and 2 to edit it. I storyboarded it and tried to get Calvin, Samantha and the rest of my group to do it, but they wanted to talk instead. I was thinking we should do Maxwell's Silver Hammer again, but with big smiles on their faces. I was asking Ms Solomon about something. Then I was watching something and Betty and Daniel (both from Ugly Betty) kissed because some lady asked them to do something. There was a video camera on a computer.",Positive
"Driving a BMW  I'm ice fishing with Grandpa Redding, one of his friends, and one of my friends. It is late afternoon. My friend and I decide to head back out onto the ice. I am handed the keys from the man's car, which is a BMW, to go to town and get bait. I go outside. The car is parked on a steep slope. Some people wave at me from the next hilltop. I think the car is stuck at first. The people that were on the next hill are then next to me. They include my mom and others. They point out that I can back the car down the slope, turning it, and come out a different way to get on the road. I do this. There is a lake at the bottom of the hill that isn't frozen. I drive into a town that I am not too familiar with. I am then on a bicycle. I stop to buy stamps at the post office. I don't have a shirt on. Then I put a shirt on.",Negative
"I dreamt I was in the practice lab at the university and Joe came to pick me up because he had a journalism session in the main hall. We went in his car and arrived too early, and in the car Joe started to hint around the fact that he wanted me to go steady with him.

"I am furious at everybody. I scream angry words at Howard. I threaten to throw out two little boys. I am angry at Dovre and her new boyfriend, a white-haired man named Sam who is 48 years old. Dovre is talking about marrying him and they've only just met and he's my age, old enough to be her father. (He reminds me of Dino.) I want them all out of my house, except Dovre. She can stay. But she is angry at me, hurt, and decides to stay with a dog-like animal who is very nurturing and nurses her babies for four years, much longer than most animals like her do. I see her nipples and feel some disgust. Dovre leaves and I sort of don't blame her.",Negative
"I was talking with Tony from Jake's Tavern. He was a graduate from a dairy college. He said he knew a fellow who took the course and it cost him $450. Then I was in the dairy. I lay by the different change processing and had a teaspoon. I was sipping up the milk and the flavor was getting better at each process. Mary Hugh, a schoolmate of mine in my youth, was walking by. I moved my head towards her and she brushed my hair with her legs as she walked by. A rowdy who was working the dairy offered the girls milk as samples, made her carry hers up a flight of stairs. I went up the stairs to the top and then started back down and she was still going up. I looked back and up and I noticed the rowdy and Mary were gone and a door to the right was open, the only place they could have gone. I had an idea, he pushed her in the small compartment thru the only door and did her dirt. I went on down into the dairy and a short while later Mary and the rowdy were coming into the dairy and she had tears in her eyes. He had forced her to his will. We were on a trip in PA. We were by Gotches and had a room to sleep for the night but changed our minds to start home by car. I looked into the bedroom and a strong breeze was blowing thru. Then we were by Grandma's and it was also in Rivertown. She made a nice ham. I looked at the thick slices right near me. It was lean, fried and red. I was walking to leave and I spotted Grandpa Evans walking between a couple fellows. He seemed to be spry and healthy. We had some money in a party that we threw. The amount was in the hundreds. I think the balance was to go to me if there was any and there seemed to be a nice balance.",Positive

"I was fixing my hair while 3 of my girlfriends were waiting for me and coaxing me to hurry. We started to go to a Sociology class. We climbed many steps and didn't know where to turn or go. (Each of the girls were approximately my age and were girls with whom I attend school.) Interpretation I interpret this dream as referring to M-- and its sororities. The Sociology class to me stands for the Sorority system, and the steps which we climbed stands for the different Sorority functions we attended. Our not being able to decide which one to join may account for our not knowing where to turn or go in the dream. Answers to questions 2. I had feelings of confusion and indecision.3.

"I was on the side of a wooded mountain with Mother and Daddy, looking down at the valley below.  It was very green, and we were up very high, because the buildings below looked tiny.  I decided I wanted to go down to the valley, so I carefully worked my way down.  After a while, the valley looked very close -- like just a few feet -- but the nearest building still looked very tiny beneath me.  It was very old, and I called back to Mother and Daddy to tell them about it.",Positive
"I dreamed I was back in W-- but the college was on the M-- campus. I drove up in front of a barber shop where the sidewalk curb had painted ""student parking."" I parked there and went into the barber shop. I almost walked into a stag room on my way past the door. Then I walked through a passage way and ended in a large stadium. I was with some girl of my own age (don't remember who) and we went up to the top of a flight of stairs and looked out over a vast stadium in which the M-- D-- festival was being enacted. This festival (in W--) is written by a student and is usually a take-off on some characters like ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Mother Goose."" There were many people dancing and running through their exercises. When we left there I took my little sister to the school bathroom. This was in Junior High School. I remember this because I had taken her to the boys bathroom. I can't remember what we did from there but we neither of us seemed too excited. Interpretation Just before I went to sleep I was thinking about the M-- D-- F-- and just what I could think up to write one myself. This I believe to be the basis for that part of the dream. As for the bathroom, we had discussed my father's mistake in going into the ladies' restroom one time when out of town that evening. This may be the foundation for that part of the dream.

"Bagel Store  I'm in line in a bagel store. As I near the counter there are women on the side, kind of in front of me. I feel it is unclear to me who was in line first, so I motion to them and say, ""Go ahead."" They act righteous, and say that they were there first and they will go ahead. I feel dumb for offering to let them go first, since they said they were first. I get two bagels: one with blueberry and one with apricot jam. After they're prepared, a woman working there submerges the bagels in water to cut them. I get some English muffins to carry the bagels on top of.",Positive
"I had a car that had a visible roof or top. It was like glass and I could see thru it. I walked to the corner and when I got back to where I parked my car, it was gone. Someone drove it off. I was on my way to work and was sort of puzzled what car I was to take to work in Broadway, Ohio. As I was waiting on a side street, I saw some cows walking down the street. Then behind the cows there was a bull. I don't know how he saw me, but the bull came right for me, charging. I jumped up on a freight car and the bull was after me. I then jumped very easily and flew a little in flight from the bull and he couldn't get at me. I saw pictures or movies of people when they were young and then old. You could recognize them very clearly.",Positive
"I also dreamt about my boyfriend, but this time we were not having an argument. We were at the movies and he was very loving, as usual. A very curious thing made an impression on me: the theater was completely filled and they were all children of approximately between 4 and 7 years of age, and the movie they were showing was a cartoon, so it's hard to understand what we were doing there. That was all I dreamt last night.",Positive

I started using anything available to feed into it, including tearing off little corners of cardboard to use as coins.  I emptied the machine.",Negative
"I go into a drug store and demand a tube of Ipana toothpaste. The saleslady tells me that they don't stock Ipana. As a matter of fact it's about the only paste they don't stock, she tells me. Why? She takes a tube of paste, presses it, but the paste doesn't come out of the usual orifice but from a cut in the tube (as one sometimes finds with an old tube). This is indicative of the trouble they've been having with Ipana. I can't remember whether I finally purchased a tube of paste.",Positive
"I was walking on a wide sidewalk on a strange street and as I passed by the stores at the side, I decided that I didn't like the dream and I wanted to wake up.

"Rudy had a girlfriend who dyed her hair blond and she was leaning over sick between her knees in a fold-up chair. Rudy made a joke about me being absent from work always in Chicago. I'd be at a bar.

One was way way past her prime but she acted all coy like she was 20. If you listen your eyes would know the difference. One was a Chinese lady. When she shook my hand, she took off my rings. Her hands were all greasy with some industrial oil and she told me, she had known, ""Hell yes, she did (know) Amelia Erhart. I hated working at the copy shop, attached in such funny ways. Outside before closing, I was going to make a break for it. A man stopped me with a nice, thick green towel that needed the ???

"We went to this swamp with the school and there were bullies and crocodiles. They would run down hills and stuff. I was in a tree with some kid. I saw some crocodiles, but I was hallucinating. I needed to get over a fence. There was something about Marill. There was some guy in the tree. He saw a girl and he ate glass. But then it was Vicadin. But he was sure it was glass. Kaylee was leaving and looking for Doctor Tam (both Firefly). Later, I was in some vehicle. Dmitri was driving and I was telling him about the crocodiles and pointing them out in river. We ended up at this weird place. It was this rocky looking thing, and it had bridge type things over water. We went though this gap, and ended up in a shop. There was this girl there with her sister. The people at the rocky thing let two male lions through. People were running back and forwards. Then everyone was together. I found Firefly on DVD. People started throwing peaches at each other.",Positive
"I'm on a bus in the morning, got to get school - I'm late. School's just started and I don't want to be late, it's a bad way to start off. I look at my watch and see that I only have 10 minutes to get there - this bus won't do it, we've got to get off. The bus stops, and we're going to walk (or run), but we have to go through this house. For some reason it's the only way to get there. It's not occupied at the moment, I think - at least nobody's home - but there is ""someone"" there. I'm not sure if it's a human. This ""person"" has a riddle or question we have to answer before we can get through the house. It's on a sort of flip-chart that he shows us, lifting up the top page to show what's printed on the next. I feel frustrated, but I know this is the only way so I look at it and try to think. It shouldn't be hard. But we're running out of time.",Negative
"Professional Raccoon Hunter  I'm fishing for carp with my friends the Ramos'. We don't catch any big ones. Franco Ramos is a professional raccoon hunter. He hunts from a boat with a dog. We quit fishing there and follow a guide boat with an arrow on it, like a flashing orange road construction arrow. The boat leads several boats, and when it gets too far ahead of the other boats it makes a looping circle, and the boats that were following go on past the guide boat. Franco says we need to be ready to go up to 65 miles per hour. My roommate Stephen Ramos drives the boat, while Franco gives directions. We jump over trees and rocks and break through windows as we go. I'm on the bow. I fall out of the boat when a big bump happens, but I hang onto the bow and swing around and get in the other side of the boat. We come to a shallow bay. It is very thick with weeds on the edges but clear on the inside. We go into the clear area. There are a couple other boats there. I see two smallmouth bass. I cast a spinnerbait by them. They follow it a bit but don't hit it. I know this big yellow and orange spinnerbait is not the ideal lure but don't want to take the time to change lures. I cast several times near them, but don't get them to hit.",Negative
"Went for a weekend retreat with Macy F at the BE Retreat Center. Lisa from the TV program dance with the stars was there as was her husband. It must have been a family retreat as there were quite a few children there. Macy F and I each had our own room. She asked me about going to dinner and I told her, if she didn't mind I would like to stay in my room this evening and spend some quiet time alone. She was fine with that. There were a lot of people there. Sister Betty was there. I had met with her briefly. They were hosting some type of social. Many people were drinking champagne. I had picked up several bottles, looking for one that was open. As I was doing this someone walked up and very easily removed the top from one of them - not the way you would normally open a bottle of champagne. I thought that if I had known that I could have done it myself. Someone had taken a champagne bottle that was only partially full and added something to it. It looked like a root beer float might look except that it was shades of red, white, and pink. It did have ice cream in it. I took one of these and poured some into a smaller bottle to take up to my room with me.",Positive

"Mort and I went down to Monticello in Virginia, the home of Thomas Jefferson, our 3rd president. He was there and he gave us a tour of his home. We had a chance to meet some of his family and all that. He was glad to meet us and he didn't care if we couldn't see. He even let us touch a couple of things in the home that we weren't allowed to touch when we visited there in 1990 with a tour group of blind persons from [an agency for the blind]. I thought that was pretty cool. He let us touch that big clock down in the basement. He took us into his gardens to see his plants.

"We were diving off the rocks into the dark blue-brown sea water. Rolling waves smacked against the rocks. We couldn't be sure if more rocks lay hidden under the dark surface of the water. So we had to check first. The other girl lost me. I had a shell necklace my father had made for me. It was a choker-style necklace and very pretty. Dora had been giving Rudy help with Science and made notes in a calendar to ""hold Science News"" on some days. The calendar was on a hospital bed. A waitress was on the run from the law in a convertible--with her new husband. She was about to divorce him if necessary. She had a little daughter. She was going to leave with her mother and cross the country--working in diners by night. She knew that at night time she could hide easier--working out in the open at all-night diners and truck stops, where time stood still, and cops would sit for hours with coffee and pie, killing time while the shift clock ran down. Her husband was driving the convertible. She had spunky blond short hair and glasses. Next to them on the highway was another convertible. A sex kitten older woman with the biggest red hair-do I've ever seen pulled up and made a move on the husband. She was about to divorce him anyway, so she (the wife) didn't care really what was going on. She was on-the-run with more important things to think about than petty jealousy. Into the sand, you would stir with a stick and say the words ""mars"" and after you said, ""Mars the Red Planet"", the sand would get lots of finer sand in dark red powder--like black cherry jello mix swirled in. Mixed more and more. Then you'd pick up the sand on the beach, pack it down a little--wait and the little teeny baby space creature would come out. Taps to the head with a stick would bring him to life where all was fine until he grew and became a menace to society and it was a massive operation to try to kill him then.",Negative
"I'm in our living room. It's a mess and I begin tidying up. As I move about, I see that the entire house is messy, so I start looking for the vacuum cleaner in order to vacuum the living and dining rooms. In searching for the vacuum cleaner, I enter the kitchen. There I find Mary. She is wearing a heavy coat, which she takes off and throws onto a kitchen chair, then rushes into my arms, lays her head on my shoulder as I hold her close, hug and comfort her. She's sobbing. I ask if the illness has returned. ""No, it's not that,"" she sobs, ""I've lost my treasures."" Then she proceeds to tell me what has happened. Her voice is muffled because of her sobbing, and I'm asking questions, trying to draw her out and find out what is upsetting her. All I can learn is that she had, long ago, deposited or placed her treasures -- jewelry and such like -- somewhere, and this place either no longer has her articles, or is refusing to return them, or is denying ever having had them, or is asking her to present them with documentation of proof of ownership. It is very confusing. I think I see Mary as having gained weight. She is dressed in a Japanese kimono and wearing a Japanese hairstyle.",Negative

She says impatiently, ""OK, but let me turn around,"" and so turns her back on me to be able to cuddle spoon-like. I put my arms around her, being careful not to touch her breasts. I accidentally brush them. I hug her and rock her to soothe her. I like our position because I'm not face to face with her emotion. I see her/my face reflected in a window.",Negative
I was at some school. Charlene was there too. We were in this place and there were people talking so we left because we were bored. Then we realized we couldn't get home if we didn't go back. When we got back they were dancing. I joined in unlike Charlene. It was a creepy dance.,Negative

I don't know in what place my dream was happening, or rather, I think I don't remember whether I recognized it. I watched how they laughed, how they shouted, how they talked. I also participated in the conversation, but I don't know what it was about. I don't know what we were talking about; it was just a group of people talking and we answered all in the affirmative.

"I see people bringing bouquets of flowers. I sort of know they are for me but don't go look yet. I see my mother and then I wander over to see who my flowers are from. I see a box of papers, the mail and see a newspaper clipping about how beloved a stepsister-in-law I am. The flowers are gone, being hidden from me until later, a party perhaps. A man comes over and talks. He has strange beautiful hair, rainbow colors and a golden shine to it. He's a sort of distant brother-in-law or something. He seems a bit in awe of me and keeps talking about anything to keep my attention and he feels a bit embarrassed about how he is running off at the mouth. I see a baby, who grabs the whipped cream. I am given a bit of chocolate cheese cake that is an old family recipe and ask if there is sugar in it. There is, but I take one bite anyway; it is heavenly. Now the baby is making a mess with the whipped cream and I grab its little chubby arm and try to take the whipped cream away.

"I was talking to some girl about music and movies (etc). They mentioned a song by someone and they pointed to a picture of them, but then it was weird they like, kissed me, but it was the picture.

"I was in a large expensive house. In a little while I was a man leaning on a cane and showing off. The cane had a monogram reading FDR. I commented that he was not using his own cane. He admitted it. The patient resembled a patient on the ward named Sopern. (This patient was of inferior intelligence and was very basic, that is, unsophisticated. He said that he had been arrested because while he was bedding with a prostitute, her 10-year-old daughter had asked him to play with her sexually and he had done so. He was accused of molesting the child.)",Positive

"Diving Loon  Something happens with a loon diving straight downward from the top of a tree. My dad is there. We are in a wooded area. We get a carp that kind of looks like a smallmouth bass.

She and my brother Wally both come out of the woods in different places.",Negative
"I was alone in a room which was quite unfamiliar to me. In this room I was only cognizant of one window with a shade over it. The setting of the room was of no importance to me when I was dreaming. I was standing on something in order to fasten the shade which seemed to be failing down, i.e., rolling up from the top to the bottom. The shade was trapezoid in shape. The smaller base was on the top and it was the part which I was continually trying to fasten. There is a break in my memory at this point for the next thing I remember is that I unfastened the shade at the top and inserted a light built into a light socket. The position of the light socket was under the shade, but I don't remember seeing it.",Positive
"We were getting photographed Ð Ann, I, Peter, John A., my mother and some friends of ours. We were elected to political jobs. I stopped at St. Andrew's parish and I wanted to go to the washroom, but there were so many things that were washed. I couldn't find a toilet. Then I went around the other or backside. There were women and men there. The toilets were exposed. The women could see you when you sat on the toilet. I was embarrassed.",Negative

I try again and again and hold the door tightly closed against the intruder. Eventually by force and patience I succeed in locking the door. I return and we spend some wonderful moments together. Ride through lovely country.",Negative
"I was out hunting. I saw a hawk sitting on a tree. I had a double barrel shotgun, but only one shell in the gun. I pointed the gun at the hawks and it didn't shoot because I pulled the wrong trigger. The hawk started to fly towards me. I aimed the gun at him, but the gun wouldn't go off. The hawk turned into a duck and disappeared behind the old brick schoolhouse of my boyhood days. I was out hunting again in the fields of my boyhood days. I put a lamppost in the center of the street, which is narrow and then I looked how narrow the lanes were on either side of it.",Negative

I introduce, ""Josh, Director of C. and Dylan, Coordinator of Counseling."" The man behind the desk observes these guys with their titles and he introduces himself with some large title. Josh looks like his usual confused and uncertain self. Dylan looks supportive. I ask the man if he's done as I had asked, to find the person and all about him without letting him know anything about me. The detective and the old lady then took me to find this person. I don't know who it is (maybe my father).",Negative
"I was studying somewhere. My chemistry exam was in a few hours, and my math exam afterwards.

Mom decided to let Dad do whatever it was she was down there to do. There was a bridge over some water and there was some traffic backed up. It started to rain and it was dark from the clouds. She drove slowly and I was worried I was going to be late. I started up making up some notes for the math exam in the car.",Negative
"(1/26/88)(After waking up, resetting alarm, and going back to sleep) Alleycat and Tree are watting for me for breakfast - and I hear noises [I think that actually happened once]. I got up and I'm in the ""den"" and notice something's missing. It's the bookcase. It's gone altogether. Somebody must have broken in, but I didn't hear anything. I'm stunned. [After a space of time - don't know what happened] I come into the living room and look around. The usual stuff is gone again - TV [not in the right place], tape deck, etc. - the bookcases are mostly empty, there's more emptiness in the room than there should be. And I notice the door's standing open - it's bright daylight, not very cold, I'm surprised Alleycat didn't go out. Now that seems very unusual. Seems to me Alleycat would have gone outside, and probably run away. [That's when things started to get mixed up with reality.] I feel sort of shocked, and a little betrayed. I pull the door shut, wondering if this is real or a dream. [I go back to bed?] When I come back into the living room, the front wall has changed to brick and the room is mostly empty. Now I'm really confused. This is still my apartment, isn't it? It looks like the wall of a hall or clubhouse or something - marks on it, corners of posters, worn red brick. I stand next to it, trying to remember if it was brick before and I just forgot, or what's going on here?",Negative
"I was returning to work after having taken a few days off. I walked in and began to change into my work clothes. I came out of the office and began to notice things were different. All of the managers were different, none of them were anyone I knew. Also, the restaurant was set up differently, almost backwards from what I remember. I was a bit confused but kept going on. I thought about how they had made so much change in such a short time, but didn't dwell in these thoughts. I began to work, me being the only one I knew, everyone else was different.",Positive

"Calvin and I were in a car and then were walking down a street. There was a big woman with blonde hair in a clothes shop -- she was Nordic looking and reminded me of Elijah. I told Calvin about her. We went to the end of the street and then we were going back and we saw a car put its brakes on. The driver guy hit his head on the wheel and then drove off. As we walked away, Classmate-M-03 fell to the ground as he'd been hit. I said to Calvin ""Classmate-M-03's been hit"", but he refused to look around. We got back to the shop and realized we'd left the car and I said I didn't want to walk all the way back. Calvin said he would. I saw Alejandro walking the way we wanted to go, so I went with him. We got to a school. We were outside the gym. I took my pants off, because it was hot, but then realized I had no shorts. We went in through the gym, into the room next to it. A teacher lady kept walking in and out and the other students there helped us stay out of sight.",Negative

I saw this guy who I'd seen earlier shoot and throw his hands up. Nothing happened and he told us to come with him. We tried to run up this big sand hill which was impossible to climb. He ran 'into' it and then stairs appeared -- there was a secret button? It didn't reach to the top, but we went as far as we could. He had to get some peanuts. Then we were sitting on a small round disc on the top. The stairs were gone. The police came and saw us eating on there, but I don't know how we got there. His name was Common [something] but later he said his real name was Windy Bags, which I thought was weird.",Negative

I went to take a photo and a lady told me I had a bug in my arm - it was sticking out the back of my arm, and was serrated so I couldn't pull it out. I went to this guy who could get rid of them and he put sewing stuff on and then said he wasn't 'good with Chabrol'. There was a list of all the guys who could get rid of them and their 'strengths'. Feargal Sharkey was a 'Chabrol' so I went to him. He put it underwater and then just easily pulled it out. Thre was a little bit left alive - the first bit was meat and the second was skin. There was a guy who was invisible and a drug dealer. He could appear for a while sometimes and could float. A guy came looking for him and he floated out of the way.

"Here is a family. They sell things. They go from town to town, gather up a work crew and pay them to work. We hawk up a crew, tell them to go buy some food and we will reimburse them. The mom tells them an economical way of buying so they get more for their money. Then she tells them to line up at the washing machines and she'll wash their clothes. They do and one of the men notices the washers are broken. A hose or pipe in the back is broken. The older man in the family shakes his head. It can't be fixed. It's the pipe. The father tries to talk him into it. The old man bemoans the use of pipe. He says, ""It's made of hydrochloric acid."" The family, he says, does a good thing. ""We sell animals all over the country. They grow and multiply. Out of 100, comes 500 and a return of 5. That we keep for our own.""

She covers her face with her hands and screams and screams. She thinks, ""It's probably a picture of me dead, dressed like zombie."" The room is very frightening (I wake up hearing the screams in my mind. There is a dream before this one that I am semi-aware of...I was so sleepy, that I just let it slip by.

"There was a new episode of Supernatural out. It started weird. It started off with Sam and Dean but they were with a girl, who was Rachel McAdams, and were following her. It was funny. She was in a skimpy Santa outfit. These guys had made a resort full of prostitutes. She was talking and saying that she fully supported it. Then when she was out of sight of them (the guys who had made the resort) she told a heap of the girls to run. Some got caught. Then it kept reversing and kept happening over and over. The son of the leader guy liked her but he was evil too. The subtitles on the screen were funny and one was about tacos. Some nerdy girl was going to something that some guy called Terence D'Arby was doing and she was excited about it. At the end of the episode it showed a newspaper with Sam and Dean's faces in a crowd and they were on a list of names. I was like 'that's kinda gay"". There were some people with a Labrador puppy and it was acting weird. I realized that it was Sylar (Heroes). This girl in the family realized and he showed himself to her. He mentioned some cat was missing. The girl was now me. I said ""you killed my cat?!"" and he said ""I didn't say anything about killing"".

"I was in aftercare at school, and all of a sudden I could buy stuff there. The total was $7.98, and then some woman that supposedly was my mom picked me up. I was in kindergarten and we had this test that I wasn't ready for. So I missed school, but still went to aftercare. I realized I didn't pay. So when I went back in my mom was in there again (she wasn't in the car). And the owners had gotten these humongous lobsters. They were about 2 yards long and 1 1/2 feet high. Then I went to pay (there was a long line of girls in white dresses that kept laughing at me). He told me that I had already paid, and we had a debate about it, and he won. But while I was going up to the car, I saw my sister and another girl (her name is Emily). They were discussing how Emily looked in the performance the school did. Barbie was just saying how bad Emily looked in the play, too. She looked bad. They were swinging around then while I was going up. My backpack was extremely heavy and the car was a Volvo. We do not have a Volvo, and it was so messy. Setting: My school's gym and parking lot. Characters: My sister Barbie. Emily, Barbie's not-really-good friend (but they are friends).

I was horrified and quite broken up about it. Also I didn't know how to tell my sister as I had to tell her several years ago of the death of another dog of ours. While I was pondering on this, a dog that looked just like ours walked in. But I was sure that it wasn't ours.

It is not a sexual dream, however. I am just debating the question. At a point I decide to do this as payment for something but then change my mind. We are then talking about marriage and someone mentions this is inconsiderate because his mother would have to travel over 100 miles. The setting is in northern New Mexico. I know this because someone says so, but it is not a place I have ever been in reality. The rocks look more like tree stumps.",Negative

I was climbing up a very steep hill trying to get a hold of a tree when I lost my footing. The next thing I remember is holding onto a stone dangling from a very high cliff. I looked down to see how far it was. It was so far down that I couldn't see bottom. I knew I would fall eventually. It was just a matter of how long I could hang on to the stone. I became very frightened when my arms started to get weaker and weaker. I finally let loose of the stone and I fell through space. I had a dizzy feeling as I was falling. I was awakened just before hitting bottom.,Negative

"I'm in the final of an extremely short distance race. As far as I can remember, the race involves making a dash for a line that's one or two paces from the start line.

They do have a modern scoreboard which is linked up to laser sensors that can detect movement to a millionth of a second. In the last round my opponent and I drew the race to exactly the same time (to a  millionth of a second). This was the re-match. I was psyching myself up for it.

He set me to work in room 306 taking things out of a closet with two separate entrances (like the ones at my church and is not in 306) and piling them outside. Soon I heard dance music and turned to see the room filled with people. I looked and saw Dick, a boy in several of my classes at Reserve coming toward me.

"I was at the farm cottage, I was up in Jackson. But it was on this acre or two, I mean instead of being in the middle of absolute nowhere, it was on this acre or two property, and we had a gravel, stone driveway like Grammy had. And it even had wooden things in the gravel, almost like a wooden boardwalk up to the house. . Anyway, we lived in a little community, kind of almost like one of those subdivision things, and all of the properties kind of looked like this. And they were spaced out more than subdivisions usually are. And I didn't even get the feeling like we were in Jackson all the time. It felt like a warmer climate. And so basically, we were milling around and doing different things. The inside looked quite a bit like our house. Let's see, click, I can't remember any real action in this, but at some time, I felt like we were riding around in the truck, around different places, and other times we were walking. And everybody was getting along pretty well, but I just felt that we were all too close together, you know, I'm used to having lots of space, and here, everybody was practically on top of me all the time, just like it was when we were at the farm. But yet the land was so beautiful and I was so happy to just have a break from everything. I believe the house had power, but not as much as you'd usually have. If I had to put it in technical terms, I'd say that the fuse box was rated for, like, 5 or 6 amperes at the most, but of course, I didn't think that in this dream. It had lights, and we could run our sound system in the living room like at home, but it didn't have, like, air conditioners and washers and dryers and all that stuff. So I was thinking to myself that I really wouldn't mind being at the farm by myself for a while. And by the end of this dream -- Oh, I know, somewhere in the middle, Mom was supposed to take me out through the back of the house. See, I had only been coming in and out of the front of the house, but Mom wanted to show me the back of the house, because it was right on this beautiful body of water. But she never did show me. Then, Terri popped in and was yacking and talking. There was something about bread, she was putting bread in the toaster. We were having this discussion about wheat bread versus white bread. It was a bagel, it was a white bread bagel. And then, we were riding in the truck again. Then, we were walking somewhere, it was very urban. Like when we take the bike to my bank and we ride under the overpass and see all the homeless people, and sometimes there's construction. It's just so loud, you've got the cars, and the echo and the construction equipment, it's such an assault on the senses. It wasn't that loud in this dream, but it looked like that. We were walking to some store with an older couple. And then I woke up.",Negative

I had sort of a strange dream that was based on sort of a science fiction story that I had read last night in which I was this man that could sort of get into somebody else's mind and follow them around wherever they went.

"Racial Integration  I'm with several people. There is a fight between a black and a white man. I break up the fight. A boy is there with a cheese grater. He hits me, intentionally scraping me with the grater. I tell him firmly and calmly to stop. One of the men is belligerent. I'm in a cafeteria with my friend Matt Yams. Matt is going to eat. Normally I don't have access here, but I may try to eat this once with Matt. Matt mentions McDonalds across the road, and we decide to eat there. We walk across the street. My high school classmate Eric Spears and others walk across the road. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper is there. I may beat up a white man. Something happens with guns. The guns are put aside in a fight. I walk outside at an intersection and use the discarded guns to get people's attention, by firing them into the air. I give a short speech, and then give the floor back to a black man who is with me. I talk about and promote the integration between black and white people. I walk inside and people start to form a group for which officers are needed. I am made president of this now society, and I get keys.",Negative
"I saw my best friend Emma.  She had her head shaved sort of like my boyfriend Jeremy's, short on the sides.  When I looked back, she was completely bald.  Water was up to our waists.  I was with my parents and following them.  We went into a hut that had something to do with Uncle Banky.",Positive

"I am in the mountains. Skiing in the red sand. The morning program is over and a woman is trying to convince me to go trekking. I go up to woman and ask her what she wants and she says she just wants a chat. She says a slow trek is much more introspective. But I want either her or to go skiing. So I go over to the ski shop. A Japanese man is trying to rent me skis with very old bindings. I refuse and say I want skis with bindings from at least 1970. He finds the bindings. But the wind is coming up so hard that I can't go skiing anymore. I am on the trek. There was a murder to be committed and I thought that one of the brothers was doing it. But it appeared that one of the other brothers, young Ethan, was going to kill the prime minister. He was an evil man. (Ethan or the prime minister?) I get goose bumps when I see this young man, Ethan, going down the mountain. He is singing the romantic lead in Fiddler on the Roof. He is very excited.

"There are six pieces of poster board and each one has pictures of six individual and different ceramic masks. I was scanning the pictures into the computer and then creating a separate graphic for each mask and naming them. I was naming them based on the poster board they came from. So, for example, there were six that I called Magic so I named them magic 1, magic 2, etc. This particular poster board was somehow related to the famous Australian crocodile hunter that died recently and has been in the news so much. His wife and his dad were talking about a good name for this poster board and they came up with the name magic because they said, quite simply, that is what he was. He was simply pure magic. I was quite moved by their admiration for him. I see that there are some actual masks sitting to my right and immediately realize that I already have pictures of them in my computer but I do need to rename each of the pictures.",Positive

"There was a TV show and I was in the live studio audience. There was a game announcer and an audience of contestants; possible contestants. The requirements to be in the audience were that you had to have quit smoking. There were 3 rounds of action. The lively announcer called names. If they called your name you were suppose to run up on the stage. The first opportunity was in round one of the action. You had to carry as many packs of cigarettes as you could hold in your hands, knowing full well it was the only time and place you could ever smoke again. You had to carry as many packs or cartons of cigarettes as you could hold in your hands and pockets--according to how much money was in your pockets and how much you could carry. They chose to smoke or not to smoke as part of the game. But to win you had to smoke a whole pack of cigarettes in 10 minutes. 20 cigarettes. In 3 rounds of the game show only girl was able to do it and she did it with ease. Those who chose not to smoke had to answer difficult geography questions. One lady dropped a bunch of packs of cigarettes and was tripping all over them and smoking flawlessly, using only one hand.

"I am afraid of this young boy, young teen, maybe 12. He is going to hurt people, me included. I run from him, trying to block his route behind me. I am now in a house, with some other people -- a woman, a girl child and a nice man. I call the police. The boy is systematically eliminating each person. I dial 911 and calmly, but scared, tell them my name and address and this boy is killing everyone and he's after me. They must come at once. He's eliminated the woman, then the girl, and now he's got the man. I am still on the phone saying, ""If you don't come now, it will be too late."" He turns off the TV and is approaching me. I bolt for the door, even though I know my best chance is to stay in the house until the police get there, but now it seems my only chance is to get away from him. I run. I am now at a lake or river with murky water. I am in the water and there is a fence to my left, dividing the water. I grab it with my hand. It is an electric fence and sharp jags of electricity play on it and jolt me. Then I (the dreamer) decide that no one would put an electrified fence over water. It would be too dangerous. I see the raft the boy made. It is a single log, tied at both ends with rope and the two other ends of the ropes are tied together at a docking like of thing. This makes a triangular shape of the log and the ropes. He yells at me angrily, ""No girl can touch my boat."" He comes for me. He dives into the murky water and I use the log as a pole to keep him from me, and then as he bites my toe, attempting to bite it off, I use the pole to beat at him, trying to kill him before he gets me. I am afraid. He's got me and is gnawing through my toe. The pain is excruciating. I am screaming, ""Help, Help!"" to get the police to know this is where I am. Then I scream V, so they know it's me, the one who made the emergency 911 call. I wake up.",Negative
"I know very definitely something occurred in the beginning of this dream, but I find it impossible to remember what it was. The first thing I recall is standing with a partner in a long double line such as one is taught to do in the elementary schools when passing through the halls. The dream is extremely hazy, although I do know that everyone was clothed in a net dress of some pastel color. In front of me and down one step were my parents. My mother was clothed in a green net gown, but I failed to notice my father. Somehow I knew that this was a wedding procession with my aunt and uncle who were to be married on the lead. I took absolutely no notice of whom my own partner was. It might easily have been either male or female. I faintly recall girls in net dresses brushing past me as they went up the steps, but there was not one individual in the dream who took distinct form or personality. Neither was there any plot or action in the dream. However, as was stated before, there seems to be much in the dream that I feel was there but cannot actually remember.",Positive

I didn't even know about the group - he's arranged this because he's going out of town and is taking care of everybody at once. His house is interesting, with a kind of close front door and entry going back to a kitchen/dining area and the group is in a room left of that. Kitchen light is yellow. They've all had to wait, not just for me, but 1 or 2 others, and now we all get up and leave for someplace, maybe Denny's. I get back in the car - it's either raining or been raining and this is an old convertible, maybe a sports car, top up.

She was seated at a table and was speaking to me of a piece of apparatus which seemed to be somehow connected with medicine.

Bryson, Nathaniel and Braden were in the family room. I walked in there because I thought Nana was in there. Bryson was on the computer. There was bubblegum all over the floor.

I helped them find something and they gave me something and I said ""Thank you for this lovely piece of bread"". It had icing sugar all around the outside of it. I tasted it and it was weird but edible. Aunt Sally had a baby. Suddenly it appeared in front of me and I (?) started chucking coins. Nana said she found my Goosebumps shirt and gave me a packet of Goosebumps stuff. I told her that when I was packing up my stuff I found my Let it Be shirt. I was then in bed trying to sleep.

I didn't get to play long when somebody said, ""STOP THAT RACKET!"" I said, ""Do you know Jasmine?"" They said, ""Shhhh. I can't hear."" I called on a phone, 377 Florida, and it was Bob Hess. There were 3 mirrors. And girls in black and white sequined bathing suits were busy staring at themselves in the mirrors and hugging them (the mirrors) and trying to look sexy.

Then in my dream it looked like the bank's vault led through a tunnel, known by everyone and lit, to the market. That is, the bank's vault led to a subterranean tunnel which in turn led to the lower part of the market, which is several stories high, and we were going through there and went to the stores. But my mother stayed in a store which was not the kind of store they have in the market building, but rather an ordinary store like you find in any corner of the city. And we stayed in front of that corner, but our corner did not look at all like the one in front, since the store in which we were is at the main square in Lima, and in the dream there was like part of the Lima portals on that corner. Anyway, we were working there. It seems that, in the dream, there was a fixed closing time, and if we didn't, they punished us and chased us, and the store where my mother was did not want to close. We had already closed when we heard sirens and other signs that they were coming to punish the people who did not obey the orders, then we (very scared) were going the other way because we had not seen my mother.

Then he does understand, and spits beer in my eye. I say to him, ""Do you want to get charges pressed against you?"" I walk away.",Negative
"I was making a CD for somebody and I was in my room and it was nighttime and it was dark and the LED for my sound system shone brighter than the sun. And my porcelain dolls were like I had tons of them and they all had little spotlights on them that were mounted on the edges of the shelves and that were so neat. And there was this orange spotlight on my sound equipment and this doll of Celine Dion that was sitting in like a teacup on top of my sound CD burner, and the body was like a small baby doll, but the head was like not in proportion. The head was like the head of like Celine Dion's age, and it had her hair and everything. And I took the doll out of the teacup and then I realized I was making the ""Falling Into You"" CD, recopying it, and I had the doll on my lap and the doll was much bigger. Again, the body was like a baby doll and the limbs got a little bit longer, but the head was like of Celine Dion's age and it looked just like her. And somehow I had the notion that in order to move forward and backward on the CD, I had to like squeeze her hand, one or the other, to go forward or backward like instead of the skip buttons on the unit. And it was totally bizarre, and before I knew it, this doll was talking to me and stuff. [laugh] Hmmmm, that was weird. Maybe it was because we were looking through Mom's dolls and stuff, and we saw her Corky doll that was like gay.",Positive
"I am a woman who is interviewing for a job. A man named Will is across the desk from me. He looks like Liam Neeson in Nell. I tell him I was fired and there was sexual harassment and so on. He asks me if he's the first person I've interviewed with. I say dryly, ""No indeed. As you probably guessed, I have had lots of interviews but no one will take a chance on me. They think, like I think you are thinking now, that it will happen to them. I will accuse them of sexual harassment, like I'm the perpetrator, not the victim."" He looks sympathetic. Then I see a scene happening in the next room down the hall. A beautiful woman is distraught. She is resisting going into a room and she calls out ""Bear, Bear,"" which seems to be a name of a small child who disappeared or was hurt. She is sobbing. I see a mask that a child drew on the wall. I also see a written report that says ""Domestic Violence."" Now Will leaves the room and I wait for his answer. As I wait, a small odd-looking man, like a leprechaun in a business suit, walks conspicuously through the room calling my attention to him, nonverbally. I watch as he leaves the room by a side door and then I look out the window as he sneaks back around to the next door and sneaks back into the hall. ""Humm,"" I think, ""he needed me to be a witness to his leaving. There's something fishy going on here."" Will returns and is kind to me. He shows me a glass figurine of a horse which belonged to the other woman. I hold it on my arm and look closely. At first it is a glass figurine of a shoe, an elf or ancient woman's shoe, then it is a horse on spindly glass triangle legs. The legs break off and I am trying to reattach them. I notice there are shoes on the ends of the horse's legs like the shoe the entire figurine was at the beginning.",Negative
"I meet Justice Clarence Thomas and the late Justice Abe Fortas.  I don't remember anything about meeting Justice Thomas except for mentioning the fact to Justice Fortas, and I don't remember a lot about the latter either, except for going down a very large outdoor stairway to his gardens, meeting him at the bottom of the stairway and being shown a huge living room through a large glass window; the living room had lots of comfortable couches and chairs at various angles in various parts of the room.  Fortas offered me tea.  He was very cordial, and quite young, nothing like in real life.  His house was in Texas.  I won the visit with him as a sort of scholarship, apparently.  I had a hard time of thinking of subjects to discuss on the same plane with a Supreme Court Justice.",Positive
"Mom and Darren had bought a new place, but it was like a caravan and had no rooms. 'Bedrooms' were now a bed in a box, as in, a small walled up part of it had a bed inside (just a bed) and drawers were on the outside for clothes. I said I'd rather kill myself than not have a bedroom, saying that if there was no room for a desk then it wasn't worth it. I was wandering around outside at some point and there was a fluffy grey cat on some stairs. I walked past it and then it jumped up at me from behind and started strangling me. I managed to get it off and ran back inside.",Negative

He's a photographer or something and this is a kind of hidden place where they can do their own work, to experiment and try stuff out, and play. I'm a guest. Actually I've been here before, my px brought me here some time ago. He thought of it as a kind of crash pad. Now I see there's an organized group here and I'm a little sheepish about it. I don't want to tell them because they think hardly anybody knows about this place, and I don't want to disappoint them. It's morning - I think we've spent the night here.",Negative
"I am a pilot in a helicopter in Vietnam which has just crashed. Either the low altitude, or the jungle canopy or both provide for a soft landing and very little damage, though it appears my co-pilot is slightly injured. There are only three or four grunts on board. I give them an order to form a perimeter. They do not obey. This becomes the basic tension of the dream: Am I or am I not in control? It would appear that I am not. We are spotted by some friendly civilians and again my orders are not obeyed. This happens a second time. Recollection ends here.",Positive
"I am with some people. The men are selfish and rude. They get ahead of me and create a wooden sidewalk to where they want to go and it blocks my access. I ask them, ""What about me?"" They pay no attention. Now they are pushy and hurtful. I go into a house and find a man on a bed with blood all over him. He is very badly injured. I ask him if he needs me to call 911. He can't speak because of the pain, but nods his head yes. I try to find a phone. Finally, I have had enough. Those harassing men are after me. I had been trying to be accommodating, but now I just want them away from me. I'm tired of them hurting me. I yell at them, ""Get into the boat! Get into the boat!"" I shove them off and then see they have taken my purse. I demand they return it, saying, ""I suppose you've taken all my money and credit cards."" They arrogantly toss the purse at me.

"A crowd of people want to get the best seats and rush forward. I want to be one of them, but hesitate. They go up a lot of stairs and sit way up high in a balcony near the stairs.

I have to bend my head some to be able to see clearly.",Negative
"This dream is very vague and hard to recall. I know I was sitting on the grass with a school friend. A car drew up & a man got out. I saw the back of his head which had a round bald spot and thought, ""He must be related to S--."" I have spent several months ""getting over"" S-- and had thought myself well out of the whole affair at the time of the dream. The man came over & spoke to us & he was S--'s brother. I kept making nasty remarks in regard to S--'s forthcoming marriage thinking at the same time, ""Darn! I'm only showing him how much I still care."" I also kept telling him my name & was disturbed that it made no impression on him for S--- had supposedly told his brother all about me, that being the height of the sublime.  I think I awoke & then dreamed of being in a hospital--for lunch or something else other than illness. I waited for an elevator in a tri-cornered section. I don't remember much more except that we had a cafeteria-type luncheon & doctors kept wheeling out huge contraptions that looked like the side of a building. Interpretation Actually S--- is not bald, but he is being married very soon. His dream brother was quite young & good-looking whereas his brother in real life is much older than he. I'm very conscious now of my feeling toward him because people talk to me of his engagement & proceed to either watch or question me quite frankly as to my reaction. I think the fact that I dreamed of a brother is significant because I have felt for some time that S--- has an inferiority complex because of his brother who is in the same profession as S--- and is one of the top men in his field. Perhaps rather than give him his just attributes I made him young & good-looking rather than very brilliant and very kind.  No interpretation for second part of dream. Answers to questions 2.

"806 came to my mind as a double. I was going to watch a stage play. Something happened to one of the players or actors, so I was asked to go on in his place. I took the part and dressed up, but I noticed a little gray beard on my face, so I got ready and our act was almost ready to go on and I said, ""Now what are my lines?"" and stage manager was surprised and stunned. Here I was, ready to go on and didn't know my lines. He told me the lines and I went on. I was not stage frightened. I repeated my lines to the girl. I had a partner and I acted natural, and it came out swell. I was congratulated for a good performance.",Negative
"I dreamed I was wearing a white uniform and was lying on a bed at the place where I work. Dr. G-- (about 30) came into the room with an enormous hypodermic in his hand. He gave me an injection in my right arm. He stood by to see what effect the injection would have on me. I became more and more drowsy. Soon I became aware that Danny Kaye was singing ""Anatole of Paris."" The record repeated itself over and over again. I wanted desperately to get up and turn off the record. But I could not lift my arms or legs. I could not even make my eyelids go up--as much as I wanted to open my eves. Even though my eyes were closed I knew the doctor was still standing at my side. Interpretation This doctor gave me an album of Danny Kaye records for an Xmas gift. My favorite record in the album was ""Anatole of Paris."" This doctor (whom I work with) had also given me an injection about a week previous to the dream when I didn't feel well while at work.

I'm at university or college. We sit at school desks - the old fashioned single ones you get in exams. There's some kind of deadline for the hand-in of a dissertation or something.

"Before I arrived or before I got into the house I was talking on the phone or something about having had some surgery. So I was arriving in pajamas and a robe and I was talking about a itch and about how each time I scratched the itch my gown moved up a little bit and I was making jokes about that. So I was still joking about that when I entered the home to begin the lecture. I was using a hairbrush to scratch my itch. I was sharing my life story of my journey to finding my current path. It was an in-home lecture. Some of it was my family and some were, I suppose, friends of family. I remember specifically Mother, Daddy, Bev, Aunt P, Larry K, Bruce W, Dick W, Sue K, Linda W. At one point, when I was kind of caught off guard, I had forgotten that this was the purpose of this lecture so I was having a little bit of trouble composing myself to start to talk. I found myself very teary and didn't want this to be a tearful talk. I was also somewhat concerned because my parents were there and I was guarded on what I wanted to share in front of them and I also did not want to hurt them in anyway by anything I said. I finally got started and a couple of times people started their own conversations about unrelated things. I just quit talking until they all quit talking and decided to pay attention. I was thinking how rude that was and how much it irritates me. I find it disrespectful to a speaker. I went through a little bit of my history and I got to People's drug stores and I started that maybe I needed to fast forward through. just recap company closings, etc and how I took that as a sign to change career paths.",Negative

We looked thru it and there were two men down there. We wanted to go down there. I yelled down and one man didn't want to move. I was going to drop in a rock. There were a lot of weeds on the grating, so we made a fire and burned the weeds. Then we were down in the hold. It was like a cave and there was a caf there. I saw a door down there.

Then she thought and said, ""Only maybe the toys should be supplied by the child welfare division as that's where you're from. Yes, we'll wait and they will provide the toys."" The girl felt very sad and I felt very sad. I looked at my father and he looked at me. We both knew the lady was wrong. We knew that because my mother had worked at the child welfare division.

"Scented Pages  I'm with others in a forested area. There is a suggestion to use pages from some magazines we have as bait, and to add scent to try to attract animals.

There is a two-page picture of a woman, viewed from the side, an all fours. She is partially naked, and her butt is raised in the air.

"I was at a place. I don't remember it properly, but there was this game where you drag a barrel to this thing over the water and create points. It was then a Runescape skill and you could have different pets. I left there and we needed to pick something up. Someone called Ari (Entourage) to ask where he was (he was dropping something off) and he was driving. He said ""Yeah, I'm on the runway!"" (a joke). I was going somewhere and Mom was picking up the thing. I was almost home when I realized that I was driving alone. I had been going 120km/h as well. I called Mom but she was just like ""it doesn't matter"". When I turned onto our street I was walking. There was a really big truck on the street. This lady said it was nuclear.

"I am somewhere with a group of people, we're working on a project - there are buildings around, but they're farm- or village-type buildings, and we're out in the country. The sun is shining, more or less, it's not beautiful here but ok. The group I'm with is not all together, but we're in one general area and there are other people in the vicinity somewhere. I'm with a girlfriend, close to the end of the space where most of us are, and the buildings are all to the left of my perception, and there's a bit of road going that way. Down the road and past us come some vehicles, one of which is a large piece of equipment, either on a truck or it rolls by itself. It's white and strange-looking. We don't know what it's for, but the whole caravan looks sort of ominous. The people on and in the vehicles seem very somber and serious, not looking round or focusing on anything except going forward. They proceed into (and possibly through) an open building on the other side of the ""village"". (I guess it would have to be like a hangar or something.) My girlfriend and I are extremely curious about this. We look at each other, and decide to go investigate. We sneak up to the building and try to peek in the windows, then duck into an open door after seeing the coast clear. We're looking around (it's rather like a barn in here) but don't see the machine, just stable-y sort of partitions and the straw. It's pretty clean in here for a barn, not smelly, and very quiet. There must be people around someplace, though, and we're being stealthy. My friend thinks these people are Russians and something shady is going on, they're getting ready to pull some dirty deed. She says we could get into a lot of trouble if we were to get caught. She says if we should get caught, we shouldn't give our real names, and I could say mine is ____. I say that's rather complicated, I won't remember it. About this time we do get caught, by a threatening-looking (though attractive) blonde woman, who wants to know our business here. After first being startled, we stumble over some lame explanation and I say my name is ""John"". My friend looks rather surprised and so am I, but it was just what came up at the time. She (the woman) says that's a strange name and I start into some song and dance about how I got it as a nickname as a child. But she doesn't care and she's not at all sure about us, so she says we have to come with her, we'll have to straighten this all out elsewhere. Then she does some things and the back wall opens, showing a (truck?) and a lot of open country - not desert, quite, but pretty barren, and we know that nobody good lives that way. We're bundled into the truck (it's like a troop carrier) and driven away, and I start to panic. I know we're being taken to Russia, and nobody will be able to help us and they'll never believe we meant no harm and they'll never let us go.",Negative

"Rover (our dog) has to be shot.  I am appointed to do it, but I just cannot bring myself to do it when he stares into the barrel of the gun so peacefully.  Grandpa finally has to do it.  I cry a while and then wake up, greatly relieved to know that it was just a dream.  After I go back to sleep, Grandma is showing me how to load a shotgun-wadding, powder, shot, etc.  She says to take ""3-inch balls"" out of a can and drop them in the barrel last.  By 3-inch, she means 3 steel shot about twice the size of a BB and one about the same size as a BB.  We then go into the woods to hunt.  The woods in Uncle Joe and Aunt Wilma's vacant lot in River City, I am pretty sure.  The first thing we see is a rabbit.  I lower my sights and track him.  Grandma keeps saying ""Shoot.  Shoot."", but he runs between us and a house.  I think the shot has rolled out of the gun barrel, but I am afraid to look down the barrel and see.  As we come to sort of a cliff, Grandma finally looks down it, and I was right.  We go back to the house and pick out more 3-inch shot.",Negative

Later I'm outside (but don't know how I got there), and I'm looking at the water spouts on the roof (I guess) and seeing how they fixed up to get water in by hooking up a pipe to a drainspout - the water's dirty but it does come in and I guess they boil it.

We go through the streets, I'm beside him in an open car, the guards on the running board. It switches to cab of a big truck and guards lined up on flatbed truck behind cab. Their weapons are pistols (like German Lugers, sawed off shotguns, like Chicago gangsters in old movies and real life) and strange double-barreled things like infra-red rifles used in Vietnam and movie I saw, Outland, for seeing warm bodies in the dark. Suddenly I'm on the curb among those watching. It seems to me that behind every woman watching the President go by is a man with a gun or pistol wanting to shoot the president. I move away and stand by a curb with no one around me. And I count about twenty in the crowd who want to kill the leader. His guards aim at them, but refuse to kill the women they are dodging behind. I wonder why he doesn't resign. I wonder why most don't leave that violent country.",Negative

I asked him what he was going to do for an income. Bill C said something about him subletting some property or something, but neither of us knew how he was going to make it on that. We were both surprised and a little mystified how he was going to work things out. There seemed to be some other people around too but I don't know who they were. I said something like, Why is it that I've managed to stay around for five years? The other people kind of laughed and I did too but yet I was serious in asking the question.

"Two Brothers  I am driving a small white car to the cabin, as if we own a cabin. I leave around 7:00 or 7:30 pm. While I drive there, it is dark outside. I spin out in the car, while on the road, for fun. I go to a driveway of a huge building with only two lights on. It is a dark road there. It seems like the building has something to do with my friend Nicole Peterson. I am in the driveway, which seems not to go to the building. I must have gone past the building, I think, and am going through woods at night. I am on a gravel road, and there are trees around me. There is a radio-controlled car 100 feet ahead of me in the road. I am steering it, but I'm in my car. I have a difficult time controlling it. I hit some buttons. The lights on the radio-controlled car go on and off. I turn them on. I have to turn the steering wheel of the car many times to get the radio-controlled car to turn. I get to the cabin, which is my house. I pull into the driveway going fast, and put the car in park because I am driving out of control and don't want to hit the house. The car doesn't jolt as much as I expected it to. I look at the clock. It is 11:38 pm. I get out of the car. It is light out. I walk to the back door. I think no one is home. I wonder if the key is by the door, since I remember using it earlier in the day, and I think I may have left it in the house. The screen door is open, and the key holder, which is about a foot long, is on the sidewalk by the steps. I go inside.

"Mom found this guy who looked after animals to look after my mice. I went over there to see them and the guy was really hot. He had black hair and blue eyes, and sort of 'masculine' and not my type, but still very charismatic (though fairly soft-spoken and quiet) and attractive. His house was full of animals and clothing racks [possibly due to stocktaking so many clothing stores lately] with lots of 'sexy' women's clothes of all different sizes - implying that he had many lovers. I remember his last name was Willett, and I think his first name was Dean. We began sleeping together - his 'rule' was that he would pretty much sleep with anyone he wanted to and never got into a relationship with anyone. This carried on for a while. One day I went over to do something with the mice and he had another girl there (hispanic looking). I was unfazed and carried on with the mice and left. Some time later he started getting possessive and told me to not see anyone else (which I wasn't anyway). Then it was a movie and he was less attractive and had a weird, deep and ugly voice. There was a girl called Ivy who owned a bakery (or something like that) who he was now 'my character'. He also had this silver/metal mark on his face and was a loud, fast talker (salesman-like). There were a few ensemble characters as well. It turned out that this guy was disturbed and a murderer and all the other characters had issues too. Ivy's bakery had actually been in an explosion some time ago, but in her mind it was still flourishing. So she was still working and serving imaginary customers (and the other customers who still believed it was fine), though it was abandoned and covered with dust and there was a broken mirror.",Positive

"In this dream, which is hard to recapture or describe, it seemed it took place in this apartment in Trinidad that my daughter and I had rented, as well as in its vicinity. I didn't actually see anyone in the dream -- just the rooms and furnishings -- but no people. The ""we"" I refer to as I record this dream are Mary, me, Maria and her girlfriend. The general ""plot"" or ""theme"" of this dream is that Mary has returned to our apartment after shopping and starts preparing a meal for us in the apartment kitchen. I am very concerned and upset that Mary is doing these things because I know she is very weak. I try urging her to stop and to rest, but she is paying no attention to me and just continues preparing the meal. I return to the dining room, then hear a strange noise - sounds like someone falling on the floor, or like the sound of toast when it is done and pops up in the toaster. I run to the kitchen, but don't look on the floor but at the counter on which the toaster stands. The toast is burned and an empty teapot is turned on its side.

"I was coming home from work with two people. One was an older woman whom I believe is somewhere in her fifties, a very active person who, somehow, always seems to me much like my mother. The other person seemed to have been another of my co-workers (the older woman being a woman with whom I work at a department store), although I never did actually establish who it was. It seems to me as though it was supposed to be a boy acquaintance of mine, someone with whom I used to go to school a number of years ago and whom I haven't seen for several months because of the fact that he is in the navy. He is about six months younger than I am. As we came out of the store I was aware of the definite need not to look directly at this third person. I thought, ""I don't want to give him the satisfaction that I am being eager."" When we got outside, we boarded a conveyance: a sort of flat cart on wheels drawn by a horse and driven by a coachman seated high in front. The older woman and I got on one side, and the other person, who I almost subconsciously sensed to be this boy, got on the other side, with his back to ours. I again was very careful not to turn around so that he wouldn't think that I was looking at him. I thought, ""It certainly will be wonderful to tell everyone when I get home that I actually rode in one of these things."" For this brief instant it seemed that we were in a strange city or country. Then I began to feel uneasy about getting home. We had to sit very carefully so that we didn't get jarred off the cart as it bumped down a steep hill. All of a sudden the woman jumped off, saying, ""Oh, my goodness I must have forgotten my glasses. I'll have to go back to get them I can't see a thing without them."" And she began to search through her pockets in a distressed manner while following the slowly moving cart down the street. I had a sinking feeling at the thought of having to turn back to retrieve the glasses, and sort of hoped that she would go back alone if she had to get them. But she didn't--she was running along behind, trying to catch up with the wagon, although it was going very slowly. Incidentally, I'm sure she had her glasses on, I remember noticing them, but just didn't feel like telling her, I guess. I figured if she said she forgot them, then she did. Another thing I remember was wondering, shortly after we got on, how we would manage the matter of the fare--concluding that we would undoubtedly each pay a part of it. Interpretation I can't offer any interpretation for this dream. I an of the opinion, however, that these people are really supposed to stand for others, because of their remoteness to me. I have no particularly strong relationship to either of them, and seldom do they cross my conscious mind. Answers to questions 2. The whole trend of events in the dream distressed me immensely.

I told her if she was going to run for president, she had to be a lot more organized and energetic and determined; she couldn't run such a slipshod campaign.  I don't think my advice had any effect; in any case I was late for class and had to rush off.",Positive
"I was at this scary place and I don't remember properly, but I was in a little house. These people came and the owner of the house told me and friends to go and hide. We went out and then ran off into the bush. Some people came out to the bush. It was freaky.",Negative
"I was friends with the characters in How I Met Your Mother. For a long time, Marshall and I would end up making out but stopping before it got too far because of Lily. We were making out in bed and it was very passionate and tongue-y. Then we stopped. There was a mention at some point about a possible threesome. I was then in a car with Mom and others. An ambulance went by with flashing lights and a siren and it did a big turnaround. We turned down a street and there were some guys on the side of the road. There were lists of top 5 games for each game company. GTA IV was on one and another was some 'maternal paternal' game. I was trying to find it online to see what it was about.",Negative
I can't remember how but there was a maggot tornado. The maggots were quite big (a couple inches long and fat) and would stick their heads into things and stay there or bury themselves inside. They hit a fan and got flung around. Most of them landed well away from me and I hid under my blanket but some landed in my bed. I was squealing and disgusted and someone else helped squeeze them out and throwing them away and I tried to squeeze the area around them because I didn't want to touch them.,Negative
"I dreamed that my mother & father were living and that I was at home with them. However my father was ill in bed. I could see him sitting up in bed, then out in the sun porch. He kept asking me when he would get well, & if he had to continue to take the ""shots. "" - He was getting medication for lues. I tried to  explain that it would be necessary for along period of time, but not to become discouraged that is was a long treatment but would be helpful to him. I asked him how he thought he had become infected & that did he have any idea how long ago it was. He seemed very surprised that I had any idea what it his illness was & he asked me if I knew. I said yes, that I wasn't a child. He began to talk of a time when he went out with some of his friends about eight years ago--however I can't seem to remember any thing more. I did feel however, that although my mother was in the dream she didn't enter into it actively. Interpretation Yesterday in class we were talking of the treatment of diabetes & the necessity to take insulin - by hypodermic continuously. This I believe caused the return of my memory when not so very long along my father was taking medication in such a way, for lues. It was some thing that I found very hard to realize existed & I never really could make myself believe it true, & I have some very unpleasant associations with it. Answers to questions 2. I felt very unhappy, & wanted to cry when I saw my father so unhappy & so hurt.3. actual participant4. unpleasant5. My old home6. Have dreamt of my father, hut not in actually in this situation7.

"Charlie Higson and some black guy were running for president. They were coming a tie, which was 60/60, and I was like 'eh?'. I was watching The Fast Show and there was something about utopia. I was also looking at something about Young Bond. I was thinking of Paul Whitehouse. We had an excursion. I was on the same bus as Ezra. Clayton was in front of me. Ezra and Clayton had chips and I was eating them too. It was our first excursion together. Calvin wasn't on the bus. Some of the street names were Impressive and Screenplay. Mom and Darren went to the US for some wine thing. They didn't want to stay the night.",Positive
"I was at home with my mom (we had just walked in the door), and this lady asked if she could come in. I asked for her name and who she was, and she started yelling at me. Then they broke into the house. Then we were at an apartment complex and I was in my PJs. Those same robbers came and stabbed me and my mom with some bamboo stick. I ran and called 911 and they came very quickly. But when the ambulance came, our wounds had healed and we were all fine. But they caught the robbers, and put them in jail. Setting: In my house, and a strange apartment complex that looked like my house on the inside, but different on the outside. Characters: My mom and my sister were there, and I know them. There were two Asian robbers and I have no clue who they are, and why they were Asian. The 911 operator I talked to was my sister's friend from school. I know the guy. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, scared, worried, relieved. I thought the dream was kind of scary because people were stabbed, but I was amazed our wounds healed quickly. At one point in the middle of the night I woke up sweating, but then fell back asleep and the dream started again.",Negative
"I was at the hospital and an advocate said I could take care of this little boy Carl. Another advocate was going downstairs and told me it wouldn't be a good idea if I come because she's going to the garage. I left the little boy and went to the bathroom. My hair was half braided and I wanted to take the braids out, but didn't know how. They were tangled. I looked in the mirror and said, ""I'd look good in braids like Tina, I should try it."" I saw two cute hippies but I couldn't find them. I kept seeing them in the corner of my eye and then they'd disappear into an elevator or around the corner.",Positive

"I was at school, which was different, and I was in Year 11. I had art first in Room D9. I had to go in through a hidden door and down these steps. There was a carousel. My teacher was Debbie (Queer as Folk US) I then had S+E. I was late there. There were people I didn't like in the class. Everyone was spread out. The desks were in levels. Dmitri came late too. I then had art again but Calvin was in my class so I asked the teacher, who was different, if I could change classes. I had to go to the front office to see some Henry guy who was actually Hugh Grant (because, as I put it, it was an all-star cast). On the way there I was debating which class I should go to.",Positive
"A road is quickly laid down on a hill. I see the coarse gravel and rocks quickly smoothing out. I see the tar poured over it. I start to walk on the new road. I say in my dream, ""Oh, it's now hard and can support my weight,"" but it's not. I see my feet prints in the new tar. The road is slipping. There are printed words and marks on the road and they are slipping so they don't match up. I roll off the edge to take my weight off the road until it hardens. As I lay to the side, a woman lays behind me and she must hold on to me because if she doesn't, she'll slide over the edge. She grabs a hold of my breasts and hangs on. I turn away from her and I feel an orgasm. It feels faint, and far away. I am aware that the orgasm has nothing to do with the fact that the woman is physically close to me but has to do with the biological needs of my body.",Negative
"I was climbing mountains in Japan-now with Jim Duggan, now with my wife Bonita.  We had one last one to climb, and it was too steep.  It was green, but not wooded.  We were about halfway up and afraid to go any farther.  Someone said we should go back to Tokyo and go up the other side of the mountain.  So we walked along the side of the mountain, along a boardwalk like the one above the St. Lawrence River in Quebec City, until we came to a ferry or a subway, which we took back to Tokyo.",Positive
"There was a bridge or dock, like the pier at Lake Evergreen, but it had a sharp turn on a steep incline.  I wondered how cars kept from crashing through the rail and falling into the water.  A little girl was there, and her father kept telling her to go on home, but she wouldn't.  There was also a house, evidently beside this body of water.  There was a rope or vine hanging down to swing on.  I don't know how I did it, but I swung very high.  When I went above the top of the house, I saw that it was flat.  I thought I would let go and land on it, but I rose too high above it to let go.  I thought I would try it again next time.  On the way down, however, I decided to let go over the water.  I kept falling and falling-not slowly, but pretty fast, like going off a high diving board.  I wondered why I hadn't hit the water, but discovered I wasn't over the water at all.  I don't remember hitting the ground, but the next thing I realized was that I was inside the house kneeling beside a chair or divan with my head on it.  Daddy was occupied with something in the doorway of another room, but he was talking to me.  I wanted to try to make him think I was dead, but I would forget and open my eyes every once in a while.  I was afraid he had seen this, and so, since he kept asking me things, I figured I had better answer or he would get mad, so I did.",Negative

"I was in a large house with my mother. I put in some storm windows in the basement windows, but I replaced the windows outside instead of inside the storm windows. The walls were thick. I hoped my mother would not notice the way I put the windows in. She didn't. A large furnace was in the basement. Later I distinguished a material from an abstract object.",Positive
"It was my first day of class. It was a small class in a wooden open building/room. The professor was a white and middle aged male. It opened out into a beautiful area. The professor was friendly and mingling. We were all mingling. Something was wrong, I can't remember exactly, but I think I felt too heavy to go to the corner of the room and pick something up? We were outside for a while. There was a man who was my age and who I remember from somewhere. I thought it was highschool, but wasn't sure. I laid down next to him, naked. After a while he started touching me. I told him I had a boyfriend and asked him to stop. He did. I feel like there were many more things happening, but this is all I can remember.",Negative
"My girlfriend Marlene and I were in an outdoor bowling alley which had a lot of shrubbery and trees around. There were a lot of younger boys around there as if something was fishy. Then we went into the bowling alley and there was a Chinaman's head in one of the crooked bowling alleys and when the boy bowled, he broke the Chinaman's head. The manager of the bowling took after the boy and I felt sorry for the boy, so we rode away and in the country was a park where we hid and no one ever found us.",Negative

We went on an excursion, and Devin and I had to sit out.",Negative

Then these ghost-like creatures came flying at us. We tried to call our parents, but the phone was dead. Setting: A room. Characters: A lot of kids, but I don't know them in real life.

"At the start of the dream I found myself in a large room filled with water. The water level reached to my hips. Suddenly I found myself wearing a pair of rubber hip boots and was overjoyed at the protection they offered. Other than the hip boots however, I was completely naked. I frantically tried to force open a door leading to another room and finally succeeded. The next room was also filled with water, but there were many hats floating on the surface. I then noticed hundreds of brown overcoats hanging on the walls above the level of the water. I wanted to get a dry one to put on, but every coat I came to was soaking wet. The same was true of every hat. After trying all the hats and coats and finding them all wet, I started to cry and that was as much of the dream as I remembered.",Negative
"I fixed my plate with rice and meat paste then began to play cards. One person was missing. ""Whose turn?"" I am No. 8 so it must be one's. ""She's gone."" A baby calls her mother. ""You play this hand and I'll take her turn next."" The older woman sits down and begins to shuffle cards, two decks together. I call her attention to that and go to look for my plate.

"Australia With Allie Crater  I'm in Australia with a group of people. We hurry to get on a train that will take us to the plane that we're flying home on. I get on the train. Others squeeze in as we pull away. All 15 or 17 of us make it on the train. My classmate Allie Crater is among the people there. We ride the train and it seems to be like a roller coaster. I'm in the front, and I sit alone. We ride outdoors, away from the station. We seem to go in water, and it feels like I get splashed, but I don't get wet. It's like the log ride at the amusement park in Forkville.",Negative
"My wife Bonita and I were in New York or some other big city (possibly Quebec).  Wayne and Joyce were with us, but whether in the same car, I'm not sure.  They had a baby and wanted to borrow our car seat and car bed.  I knew Bonita wouldn't like the idea at all, so I tried to make excuses for not lending those items to them.  I don't remember what excuse I used for the car seat, but I told them the bed smelled like cat urine.  I think we ended up lending them the car bed anyway; I'm not sure about the seat.",Positive
"I went to this place with a group on a tour thing. There were footprints in the wall that were massive but were David Bowie's. There were hands of celebrities as part of the decor as well. I went to the place where they were filming Stalled except it was like a classroom. They set us up so we were sitting along the wall. I was looking for Dan Palmer. Somehow later, I was talking to a lady about a project and she said yes and then I went to a place and opened the door and went in and Dan Palmer and Christian James were there. I said 'she said yes' and we all sighed with relief and it was a producer for a film/TV show we were doing together. The place was empty and square with a rectangular shaped kitchen to the side. Christian James got a blanket thing and folded it up in a corner like a bed, then got this sheet and stretched it over the kitchen. I wanted a bean bag for the corner.",Positive
"I am in some kind of small western town.  There are horses in a field near a rail fence.  One horse glows purple in the setting sun, and the other orange; both have a kind of slick, shiny appearance.  I think it would be a great picture, but as I approach the fence, getting my camera ready, they turn slowly and walk off farther away.  By the time I am ready to take the picture, they are out of range, and clouds are passing over the sun.  There is a group of people in the field, and one of them, a young woman, holds a calf up.  I want to get a picture of that, too, but can't get there in time.  Then there are two guys standing on really tall stilts right beside a building with something like an open hay loft in it.  They are so tall that they are on the same level as the loft; the loft has people standing or sitting in it too.  Some people are taking pictures of that, but the sun is in my face, and when I go to get another angle, I have difficulty focusing my camera, and eventually I find that the men aren't there anymore.  It is a frustrating dream.",Negative
"I met a young woman, and she questioned me about some best seller books to see what I knew. I knew about some of the books she mentioned. Later two young girls about ten were getting into a double bed in their room. They acted as though they were feeling erotic toward each other. They decided to lie head to foot. They got under the blanket and began to giggle. I don't recall getting into the bed, but I found myself there looking under the covers at them. As I watched, I had an emission, and they chided me for doing it.",Positive
"I was kidnapped, and tied to something that had sharp points. Other prisoners were there. We had to obey strict commands. I felt as though I would be there until I died.

He nodded when I had finished, but I was afraid that he did not believe me.",Negative
"I'm staying a week at a friend's house (Aubra Helen Shiftner Caroline), and I'm going to take some drug associated with the number 258-658. I'm watering plants and there are shoots of evergreen next to the house. They're very dry. Then I'm moving a car, and there's some connection with ""socialism."" My mother is watching. I back one car up cutting it sharply. It hits another red car very gently, but I think to myself this is alright even though the side of my car could be creased because it's socialism. The other car is my mother's. It's all by itself and rolls slowly across the street up a slight incline, turns around and stops in a perfect spot. Another car comes and they start squirting water from a hose because the car is empty and driving by itself. I have a feeling of putting Body English on the car by remote control and being a little amazed at how successful the Body English seems to be since the car stopped in a perfect spot.",Negative
Kevin sells Terry Mushrooms  I'm talking with my friend Kevin Simpson. He just sold my friend Terry Foss an eighth ounce of hallucinogenic mushrooms for $40. I wouldn't have done that.

"I live in a village at the top of a hill in rural Spain or Italy. The buildings are tightly packed together, made of beautiful red stone or render. The sun is casting a strong orange afternoon light. It looks like a Hopper painting. My eldest daughter is at our apartment, on the top floor of our building which is perhaps four stories high.  I'm out on the streets - I look up and I see my eldest daughter is out on our small balcony.  Above it is what looks like a skinny bell-tower, but it is part of the architecture of the flats. There are arches and red tiles. I am running down the steep narrow street because I had left somebody waiting. My daughter wanted to come with me but instead she jumps up and down on the balcony waving her arms to catch my attention. I turn back and look at her - I'm worried she will fall. I shout back to her to tell her not to jump up and down on the balcony.",Negative
"I was in Rivertown and I wanted to see what I could dream of to play a winning horse, but couldn't. I tried to look, they fly, but I didn't fly so high. I got my feet wet so I went by Grandma.

I was looking for coal in the woodwork and couldn't find it. I looked in the form and saw Busy Pony starting his season.",Positive
"Scene laid in East Potomac Park, on golf course. Near clubhouse (just east of clubhouse) were 2 midget airplanes sailing around. 2 or 3 feet off the ground. The planes were just large enough to accommodate 1 person, and there seemed to be no motor nor wings. Shaped something like this. They were covered with this sheet metal, olive green in color. There was a small glass window on one end, and somewhere else a grating. The speed of the planes was very low and they were able to hover like a bird. One of them came directly toward me, but I was not alarmed as they were so small and light, and furthermore it seemed to me that the pilot was merely trying, in spirit of playfulness, to see how near he could come without actually striking me. I did, however, give ground -- i.e., stepped backward a short distance -- though waving to indicate to the pilot that I recognized his tactics as playful bluff. pointed out that the aviator who flew to the North Pole used a plane that could hover; I said, yes, but that most planes landed and took off at rather high speeds.",Negative
"Killing A Loon  I'm walking with my housemate Stephen Ramos and our classmate Harry Melner towards a swamp where there are a lot of duck hunters hunting. We're on a blacktop road. I see several hunting parties in the swamp wearing blaze orange. Someone in one of the parties yells, ""Sluuu"", and I realize this must be one of my friends Bubba Hacker or Jose Ramos, in a party in the swamp. We stop at the edge of the road and the swamp. There are many ducks flying overhead. There is a triangle in the sky that is lighter in color against they grayish background of clouds. The ducks swarm down. There are a lot of ducks on the water. Someone gives a yell, and the hunters rise up and fire. It seems like an unusual word that one of them yells. Ducks fly everywhere, but remain in the area surprisingly long, flying around. A loon flies directly at me, really low to the ground. I grab its feet and swing it around, smacking its head against the blacktop repeatedly. I think it must have been hit by one of the shots. I see blood on it: it appears to have been hit on the left rear side. I hope that I killed it by myself.",Negative
"I was driving with Mom and Ezra. We went to McDonald's. I think we were outside. We ordered a new ice-cream each plus one old one to share. There was music playing, which was all stuff from my playlist except Mama (Genesis) was in it. Ezra complained about the music and I said ""I chose this!"". Some guy was talking to Mom about ice-skating. I checked my downloads and I had a movie called Ficur Ng which was about talking monkeys that only say ""ficus"" [Watched Kiss Kiss Bang Bang yesterday]. I also had a Marx brother's movie and other stuff. I had 110 movies downloading in one day. Then I was in the car with Dad. He was going to go through a drive thru but it was full and every time we came back it was a huge line. One day he parked on the side of the road and it was getting dark and the guy at the gate went out to get food, so we couldn't get in. We went back to the car but this guy put something on it to say it couldn't be driven. He said the guy at the gate had paid him to. Then this fitness couple, who were Mario and Lisa from Big Brother UK, plus this old guy and a young girl, who was Stephanie from Big Brother UK were training to escape from some place. They pretended the guy was a part of the team but they knew he was a bad guy and had a secret plan. Lisa was pregnant. The place was really creepy and had lots of dry plants.",Positive

"Cousin Terence has a newborn baby girl. I hold her. She's very beautiful and well-formed. She's also very intelligent and talks.

I try to remember their birthdays. Darcy's is XXX 3rd or so and my ""sister's"" is XXX the 15th. My ""sister"" explains that they were born with nearly half a brain. If you are born with just half a brain, you die. I see what looks like a water melon being chopped in half by a huge knife; however, they have a little more than half a brain.

"Last night I seemed to be in a small prayer or social meeting, perhaps in Wilton. A speaker had just finished and Professor T.B.T. began to say something about our Puritan forefathers. He did not rise. He uttered one complete sentence and began another, but suddenly his voice weakened, he stammered and was still. He slipped down in his chair and people gathered round him, shutting him from my sight. I heard him gasp feebly, then there was a long painful pause. ""Campie"" pronounced the benediction.

He said he was not feeling good because he worked too many hours. I saw ""whence"" by itself in the paper at the end of a sentence or it was alone. I wanted to dream if Star Boots was going to win today and someone gave me a $7 bill, which there is no such bill, but Evans had a 7 in one way. I had it on the ticket.

"We were all this party, and Dad and Mom and I were holding hands with a bunch of other people in their 40s, and we were all kind of marching around the trampoline and singing a variation of one of the songs that we normally wouldn't even sing to. The real song goes, ""Sally go round the sun, Sally go round the moon, Sally go round the chimney top every afternoon, boom!"" And the rendition, the variation in my dream goes, ""Cindy around the chimney, Susie around the sun, Cindy around the chimney, and then the work is done."" I can't explain that. Then last night I had a dream that I was walking down this long hall with Mom and we were like at Six Flags or something, and it was this exit place for handicapped people. And it was a long hall. And we finally get to where they open the doors, and we were supposed to ride on this little coup car thing, but we couldn't because there was a storm coming. And then person who was supposedly a jet ski rental person came over, and Mom told her about the storm. And then suddenly we were at school and I was showing Mom things before we left for the last day. And it ended like a week ago. And I was afraid that I didn't go and take one of my exams because I could only exempt three exams, and I only took two exams. But then I realized that Media was one of the exams and it wasn't even like taking one. So then I was showing Mom the elevator, and she didn't have a key, but she could put $5 in it and go down to the first floor. And then we were sitting on a bench with this administrator lady and she said that everybody's key is - oh, what's the word? They have this thing in there where you can only go to certain places at certain times, and I said, ""I have never noticed that,"" and she said, ""That's because you're never sick.""",Negative

There was something on at 2.30pm the next Wednesday -- something to do with Kiefer Sutherland coming to help you when it's 'hot'. I was thinking that I wanted to go. You had to order tickets. Adam Baldwin was also going to be there and he was interviewing people for plays and he was a playwright. I was also home at one point and I was watching TV with Mom.

"I had a '49 Ford. It was blue. It was like a Ford that I had when I was in high school, and I didn't have anything to do this night so I was just driving around. I went to a place that resembled the buildings around 12th Ave. and 13th St. These are the federal buildings where the jail is and stuff like that. I pulled over on a side street right off 12th Ave. at night, and I was just watching the traffic. I was real close to the Miami River bridge. I came back to the car and found a ticket on the windshield saying that I had parked crooked. When I parked there was no one there, so I didn't know. So I parked at an angle, and didn't know everyone was supposed to parallel park. I was the only car parked at an angle, but this ticket was not written on the regular form of type ticket paper. This was written, I had an old piece of paper laying on the seat, a piece of loose leaf paper, and the ticket was written out on that, and it said to report to a certain place in Coral Gables. I knew there was something wrong because you don't go to Coral Gables for a parking ticket, but I didn't question, I was going to question the matter, so I was going to walk to the jail, to the courthouse where I was and ask them about it first. While I was walking, there was a bus in front of me, a Miami Transit Co. bus, and on this bus a little side door opened, like on the Greyhound bus where the baggage goes. Anyway, there was a side door on it. This Volkswagen 3 unit car. It was made out of all stainless steel or aluminum. It said Volkswagen on it, and it was like a little bus in itself. It had three units on it like three little cars. This thing drove right into the baggage compartment inside it, drove right inside the baggage compartment of the Miami Transit Co. bus. I remember that because it turned right in front of me to drive into the compartment. This is why the compartment was made, for this little other. There was a compartment on the big bug and it was made for this little Volkswagen bus which was about 3 feet high and about 15 feet long. So I saw this and I didn't think much of it because I thought it was something natural and then I went to ask about my ticket. I got up to the steps. It was very confusing inside. They were just letting a whole bunch of prisoners go, and a bunch of bums were just walking outside. So I figured I would just forget about it and go over to the place where I was supposed to go. So I just walked back to my car and got in and drove away, which was the end of the dream.",Negative

"This dream was quite confused and uncorrelated. I remember, in one part, doing a dance in a pair of black velvet leotards (shoes). I don't know where I was dancing or why. Then I recall talking to a boy, BF, age 20, with whom I went to high school. I never really knew him--only enough perhaps to say hello, but in the dream, we were having a long serious conversation. He asked me to go out with him and I remember not knowing what to do, whether to go with him or not. Two of my girlfriends from high school, EL and DG, advised me not to go with him. I thought the only reason Ellen had said not to was because she cared for him a great deal and was hoping that he would ask her out.",Positive

"A group of vampire type people had taken over one of the carriages and blocked out the sun and just kept to themselves (there were quite a few of them in there and I think they'd either eaten or gotten rid of the people in the other carriages). They could go in the sun but would feel sick and blinded and would eventually just like throw up and die. They would get out of the train at night, usually at public toilets to find people to eat (lots of toilet stops presumably because there were no toilets on the train). Two guy friends were at this toilet when the train stopped there. It was hinted at that one of the vampires had died and they needed a replacement. They weren't really bad guys, but they did need to consume blood regularly. One of the vampire guys got off and 'infected' one of the guys (can't remember how it was passed). The guy ran off with his friend though. Whilst the vampire was looking for him, the guy accidentally infected his friend (they didn't know at that point though). The sun came up and the guy was outside but for him it looked like a desert and the sun was bright and hot and he was feeling sick. The train was nearby and the vampire guy told him to get in or he'd die and he went with him and got on the train. When he felt better he refused to go anywhere else without his friend. He found him eventually and realised he was infected and dying. He told him to get on but his friend refused, so he grabbed him and took him on to the train. It screeched to a halt and a warning saying the passenger limit was overloaded started going off (which would call in authorities if left too long) and the friend jumped back off and said 'it's too dangerous, just leave me' and the train started up and he tearfully watched his friend as it moved on.",Negative

"In this dream I remember going to downtown Miami in a car. My father and another man were with me. I recall that we got downtown and parked the car at the garage where I work. We even went with the car up in the elevator. My father asked the attendant if the car would be safe, and the attendant replied that a triple lock would be used. This seemed to satisfy my father. I also recall telling the attendant that I worked at the garage part time. Then the three of us went down to the street. We were going to go eat and then watch a parade that was scheduled. It seemed to be the New Year's Eve parade, but this time it was held during the daytime. I remember that my father didn't like the restaurant that we decided to eat at and he wanted to go back and get the car and go someplace else to eat. This made me mad and I told him he could do that if he wanted to, but that I was going to eat and then watch the parade. The three of us split up and then I remember walking down Biscayne Blvd. South toward the curve in the road. This seemed to be after I had eaten. I remember seeing the Vanguards Drum and Bugle sitting in a very grassy area. I recall very vividly their red satin blouses and the bells of their instruments shining in the sun.

"I'm on a city street, walking, there are lots of people around, I know at least some of them, that is to say I live here and am a part of this place, I belong here. It's daytime but the sun's not terribly bright - a workday. From somewhere comes a fire alarm, sounds like the one at work, and everybody starts moving to certain places, as though it's backwards and you respond to this signal by going underground rather than outside. There's no fear, everybody seems to know or assume it's a fire drill [and that's what it's called, too - there's no assumption that it's anything else, like bombs]. The place I'm going to is at a corner, and looks like a drain opening. I'm not sure exactly what to do, but Kay is right in front of me and she says we go down here. I'm thinking surely a person can't get into that, but as I get closer I see it's bigger than I thought. Still it looks awfully cramped, and I'm not looking forward to squeezing into it and maybe hurting myself, but Kay just steps into it and goes down like she's walking on a staircase. By George, that's what it is, and it's even big enough for more than one person. [I'm not conscious of the opening actually getting bigger, but surely it must be - it looked so very different from time to time as I approached.] Now we're part of a group steadily moving down the stairs to what looks like an Underground station. Kay goes off somewhere else, but I'm staying here in the near vicinity, and there are 3 or 4 guys sitting together in a sort of small auditorium, near the back. There's nothing actually going on in here, just people sitting through the fire drill, and I chat a bit with these guys. They're maybe in their twenties, buddies - I'm not entirely comfortable with them, they don't altogether want me in their group, but I don't want to go off anywhere by myself. We talk about getting something to eat - there's a sort of kitchen nearby, and the idea is something like (pizza?), maybe we could get that together. But I'm not sure, maybe I should get some fruit instead. I get up and I'm actually thinking about going up outside. [The idea is like there's a fruit-cart out there, or something - it's a bit mixed up with my basket of fruit on the counter. And this in spite of the fact that there hasn't been an all-clear signal yet, we're not supposed to go out - and I have the idea you stay down for quite a while when you do this.]",Negative

I was talking to someone about the SDI program. The interns have to have a spiritual director while they are in the internship and they also must have at least one directee during the last year of their program. I was saying that I no longer see the directee that I had during my last year in the program. For each new group they would match up each intern with someone that had completed the previous internship. That person would be their spiritual director during their internship. I realized that this system worked out very well because they always had the same number of people in each internship - allowing for just enough directors for the interns. They wouldn't do this in waking life because it wouldn't be appropriate to dictate whom someone sees as a spiritual director and it wouldn't necessarily allow for the best match.,Positive

He's grading the first section of the examination and he turns to me and says: ""Would you like to see a real wild chase?"" or something like this. He shows me one of the answers of the students which is a complete misinterpretation of the question and 100% wrong. He writes in big letters across the top of the question or answer rather, ""interpreter,"" and by this he means that the student has written down a question on the exam as an answer and it seems that this is fused with an image of the windshield of an old convertible Model T Ford or some such car because the windshield is square and mounted on 2 large supporting rods on either side so that it would swivel. It's not square. Actually it's rectangular and flat. Then all that appears in the upper left-hand corner of the driver's side and written across the window in letters that are a yellow, brown and red plaid is the word ""interpreter."" It's such that it represents an accusatory statement and accusing the person of cheating actually because implying that the person just looked at somebody else's paper and copied a question rather than the answer in a seemingly frightened attempt to get something down on the paper. Now beneath the word ""interpreter,"" the windshield has a slight break in it. There's a hole in it, as a matter of fact, about 2 inches in diameter over which a small net is scotch taped on. This net is in the shape of, I believe it's called a weather sock, you see on top of airport hangars. It's conical and about 7 inches long, and it has a yellow plaid design on it, not as complex as the other plaid though. At that point the dream seemed to have ended. I got the feeling that Arthur was taking a sadistic glee in having discovered this error or someone's approach to the examination. In regard to the images I had when I mentioned to my friend that the place was filled with weird characters, the image of Swisher also included one of the female graduate students with whom he has been ________ have been having a bizarre relationship. The image of Allen is one in which he is seen from slightly above the waist up. He's complaining or wailing about something. I think it's  a textbook he's justifying as valid for a particular course. At any rate, it's some very inappropriate and super-defensive kind of argument he is putting forth. Then I believe there's a slight impression of Fisher and his whole out-of-touch approach with regard to psychology. At the time which I am talking or with Art Yehle, we are actually in his office in the psych dept. I get the impression that he is Tedeschi's assistant. In regard to the image of the windshield, the weather sock, or the analogous structure that's taped on the windshield is blowing into the car. That is, it's pointed on the inside of the windshield. The word ""interpreter"" is read correctly from the inside also. It's written just above this weather sock at a 45 degree angle. Day residue: I passed Granville Fisher's galleries today in the car and my thoughts became filled with this other kind of activity about Fisher and thoughts of the department and other people. This lasted only about 3 or 4 minutes. I remember reading a couple days ago, yesterday, that the A and P was now giving out plaid stamps in half of their stores for the first time in their history, they were giving out trading stamps as a move against competition. This accounts for the plaid designs. The weather sock, though it looked like a witch's hat, just the top part, and this perhaps is associated with the story I read in Life Magazine in which a witch's hat figures as one of the elements that is on a map and this drawing of the witch's hat supposedly  represents, it's called a _______ which used to be called a sombrero.",Negative
"I was living in an unfamiliar house. My mother tied my ankles to the bed as I lay on my back, so that I would not get upset. I looked outside the window. Three shade trees, about 30 feet tall, were outside. Some of the leaves were turning brown. The sun was setting, and the rays shown through the trees making a reddish brown light in the trees. The beautiful light fascinated me.",Negative
"I was at the apartment, but the parking lot was much bigger.  I took the recyclables down to the dumpster and ended up in the elevator, which was on the outside of the building, with the fixit man.  He got on my case about not organizing my recyclables better, that the newspapers get moist and stick to the bottom of the dumpster and he has to go clean it out.  It wasn't the first time he'd mentioned it to me, although I didn't recognize him, but I had forgotten.  I apologized.  For some reason he offered me a ride and I got in his truck.  We drove to the other end of the apartments (they were much larger).  I went in the office, and it was like I was going to work.  I think we were getting ready to close for the day.  I took off my dress shoes and sat them in the corner, and I climbed under a desk to unplug or turn something off.  Then I went outside, and the apartment was on the water's edge.  I think then the building was supposed to be a school, and there were children playing in the water.  On the left was a waterfall, and next to that was a small house on stilts just above the water.  Might have had a waterwheel, too.  I noted it was unusual for the kids to have an opportunity like that.",Positive
"I was at a shop with Mom. I was looking at the movies and you could tick your favourites, so I did it with a few. Benjamin turned up and said hello to Mom and me. I ignored him, not even looking at him. I remembered he had mentioned shopping here before. He said goodbye and left. Then we were at a Science Museum type of place. I was alone and went into this aquarium bit, saying to myself that it was my favourite part. There was a turtle walking on the path and I took a photo. I was taking lots of photos and was thinking to put them on the forum, until I remembered about my silent protest. I saw Benjamin there and I tried not to look. I could 'see' his thought; 'ok, just ignore me and don't talk to me'. I thought 'that's the same thing I thought when he ditched me'. I was happy that he felt ditched as well, but was still confused why he did. Then I was at a food place. He and a friend sat in front of me and I still avoided looking. An ugly girl started dancing and Benjamin was staring at her with a 'pervy smile' and I wondered why it was always the ugly ones. I hoped that he would notice me once I lost weight.",Positive

I'm late, of course, and going to be later. I'm nervous about that and decide to turn back rather than go in so late. Now I'm at my father and My stepmother's house - I seem to be staying here. It's a regular sort of suburban house. I don't have a key with me and I don't know if I can pick the lock or break the door in - and I don't want to be seen breaking in, but it turns out if I just jiggle the handle a bit and lift sideways, it opens - the lock parts are loose.

"It is not necessary to add anything to the description of the room. The only new thing is that I have added a poster of Che Guevara which I painted. I dreamed I had been at a meeting with a group of friends in a coffee shop downtown, discussing several things that were on the news. Later, as it got dark, my friends started disappearing one by one and then the other people who were there. The moment came when I was totally alone. I went outside and the streets were also empty and were lit by tiny lights and it was raining lightly and it was extremely cold and there was a lot of fog, which made for very poor visibility and didn't allow me to see the objects around me clearly. I was walking through some narrow streets, wearing a thick coat, a hat and a muffler and these clothes made me feel somewhat strange and mysterious. I felt I had to get to some place and when I was one block away from a place which was in better conditions than the one I was in, I stopped and I felt I was getting away from that place, but could still see it. And suddenly I felt that someone was touching my shoulder and I awoke and it was my mother who told me it was time to get up to go to the university because it was getting late.",Negative
"I was at a New Years party.  It was at my maternal Grandma Jane's house, but not thrown by her- I didn't know most of the people there.  There was a grandmother of some grown boys, and she gave them each a gift in a bag hand-decorated with yarn.  There were patties like what we had with dinner last night, but some had macaroni as well as lentil mash.  I sat on a barstool in the kitchen next to my brother Stuart.  He was on a laptop IMing with his wife Sheila.  There were cartoonish ""cutesy"" bears all over the screen.  Sheila said, ""muff!""  I walked toward the doorway to the living room.  A large dog was laying in the doorway and one of the boys shot an arrow at him- it landed in his flank right next to four other arrows that had already pierced into his skin.  The dog lay there, and said, ""Ow, not again..."" but not very emphatically.  I was angry at the boys for hurting the dog.  They were old enough (20s) that they should have known better.  I also felt lonely as I didn't know anyone at the party.",Negative

"I'm at some hotel like the LaPlaya in Carmel, California. There's some kind of a political convention going on, and I'm systematically spilling dirt out of a vacuum cleaner on either a driveway or grass lawn. Then I have my citron up on a lift in a garage and the mechanic is Mr. Kazon of the Harvard travel service, and I'm saying there must be a leak in one of the tires because it's way down, and he in his very competent manner dismisses this as not right because he says cars never go down that fast because of a leak. The feeling is that he knows exactly what he's doing and this makes me feel very good. I notice as the car is going up on the lift that there are big chunks of mud stuck to the cracks in the tire tread. Next Stanley Cantor is standing naked in a room and is having some very routine service performed for him, like have a button sewed, his fingernails cut or something like that.

"I was outside at night with Mom and Rover. Rover barked and then lay down on the front porch to sleep. Mom said he barked to let her know what his bark sounded like. There was some game with a guide dog and a torch, and you had to move from area to area and I think you had to do something too. If you were caught by the torch, you lost. I had a cute little terrier thing. It kept running away though and went to sleep under Rover. I had to walk through a tunnel with train tracks. Someone had set a path, which I followed. When I got out, I saw a torch flashing outside I started down a nearby path. I went into a room and then didn't know what to do. The torch was coming closer and got me and it was Alexis Denisof and he seemed happy to get someone. His accent kept changing from English to American.

I think he may have bad knees. He goes up against the young tough guy too. The chief has a long stick with a clear gem attached to the end. It looks like a diamond, but I think it is too big to be a diamond. The fighters have smaller sticks with gems. One fighter uses bubbles to protect himself from the blows of his opponent's stick.

"I've been at the Fair, it's a bright sunny day outside of town, and Jenny is driving us home - I think there's 1 or 2 other people with us (maybe 1 male, 1 female). We're going down a road near the freeway, eventually to meet up with it, but we run into a lot of construction vehicles. It's only the very beginning stages of something, but these large vehicles are over and around the roadway, the land all around has been flattened; but there are no Keep Out signs or barriers, so Jenny just drives straight on up. We're thinking maybe this isn't such a good idea, but the majority of them are moving off the pavement, you can see that it isn't busted up, there's no reason we can't drive on it - but is the end of the road clear, to the next street? I'm sure we're not supposed to be doing this, but as soon as the last vehicle moves out of the line of vision, we see the rest of the road is still ok, and Jenny drives on through. I'm looking at my arm (right forearm). There seems to be something written on it, but on the underside and I can't quite get a look at it yet. We did get our hands stamped at the door, but that was the left hand; now what's this? I remark this to the others, who look, and we finally see it's a map of the fair, colorful, with humorous stuff on it. It's actually a T-shirt transfer that I seem to have gotten stuck on my arm, presumably leaning over some of them. I'm back at home now - I live in a house with my father and stepmother (I'm still pretty young, maybe 18 or 20), and they're not home. I go out in the back yard, which is phenomenal - it's big, and all dug up like an excavation. There are mounds of red earth and little cliffs, and open pits. One of my friends comes to tell me there's a kitten out here in trouble - it's lost and found its way in here and can't get out. We find it - it's not in too good shape - and take care of it. Back in the house, I'm in the kitchen (right end of the house as you look from back to front) and going toward the den-living-room areas when I pass by a small room glassed in like a listening booth, and one of my friends is in there. He's telling me my parents are coming in, warning me not to go into the living room. (This is not a major thing, just information - what emotion there is is not a big fear, but it's as though I'm used to it. ""Oh, yeah, right, you don't go in there if your parents are coming in, you stay out of the way."") I did see them come through the door, My stepmother in her big red wool coat with a head scarf and Dad looking like he used to. I just faded back to my bedroom (left side of the house). My room is sort of shadowy. The outside light is fading now, and the sky graying over too. There's a big long window with drapes here, over my dresser, on the front wall of the house, and I open the drapes to look at the view. There's all of downtown right smack in front of the window, all these tall buildings and skyscrapers. We seem now to be high up in the building, as if this is an apartment. As I watch, I see several flying cars, oh boy! Flying cars are quite new, and expensive of course, and you don't see so many of them. These must have been at the Renaissance Fair. They're all pretty big - one of them is a very substantial-looking station wagon and one's a Jaguar (white, not real big but not a D- or E-type either). I rush around to tell the others to go look at them, and they all go to other windows to see, and the sun's even broken through again, a lovely golden sunset on the rooftops and shiny buildings and the cars. Back in my room, the sun's gone in again, but the cars are still pretty neat. There's even a little San-Francisco-type cable car. They all look so grand, drifting easily through the sky. Now I'm outside, some of us are driving through town, still looking up at the flying cars, and there's a white bus or something off to my right, I can only see the top of it, though it's higher than we are - there are trees around it. I was thinking that's awfully big to fly, and then it becomes clear that it isn't, it's on the ground, just higher up on a hill. We get to another apartment, and we're there for a Training. Lloyd's here, this may be his place, and the trainees are here too, sitting in the living room. I talk to Lloyd for a bit - he sure is talking funny, very animated and enthusiastic, not like usual. I go into ""my"" bedroom. I'm not sure if I've just switched houses, or if I'm moving in here, but I do have my jewellery and other things here. They're not all organized, dumped on the bed, and things need to be sorted and put in the closet (just to the left of the bed - a real standard bed; in fact, both of these bedrooms are very motel-sort-of furnished, nondescript dressers and low metal-frame beds without headboards, dark industrial bedspreads, no ornaments). [I go back out and come in again for a rest; I mean to lie down on the bed.] Sherry is in here, with an older woman. They're chatting. Sherry says to me, ""I don't know how you find anything with your stuff all scattered around like that - we just sorted all your jewellery for you and put it away."" I say, ""I was gonna do it soon, you know I've only just moved in here, and I haven't had time.""",Negative

She goes off and I stand in her place. Later, I go outside and am still looking for the camera. I go home, driving my van. I go in and a man from a publishing house is waiting for me with good news. He wants to publish my book. I ignore him, looking for the mail. I see two rejection letters there. I decide to go downstairs and take a swim. I go down a long flight of white stairs where the walls are up high. I keep trying to make the walls into windows, but no dice. I get to my basement and see a huge swim pool. I know some men are waiting to go swim, but I take all my clothes off and dive in; they will just have to wait. I swim well and it's very sensual and wonderful. Everyone waits for me.",Negative
"I was out in public, maybe in a restaurant, and saw Jane C somewhere. She sat down on what might be something like a barstool to my left. She asked how I was doing. She seemed genuine in her concern about me, rather than to ease any guilt or second thoughts Bill C may be having. She wanted to know if I was doing okay. She said that every now and then Bill C thinks about calling me, or emailing me, and inviting me to have coffee with him. He always decides against it. She asked me if I ever intend to call him for the same reason, or if I have thought about it. I hesitate. I'm not sure how I want to answer her question because I'm not sure that I want either of them to know that I have thought about it. She asks me again if I will be calling him. I still don't want to answer. There is a part of me that wants to call him, but a bigger part of me that wants to resist that temptation.",Negative

There was a fire in the house and she got out, then I forgot how to swim and I went underwater. The people thought that it'd take days for me to get back. But I got back in 10 minutes. The cop was angry. He got everyone to line up on this ledge. He threatened to throw a snowball. I was close to him and he threw it while looking at me and I ducked and fell into the water. He had aimed at another person on the ledge behind me, which was a bit higher. Calvin was next to me and I whispered for him to move. He got away, but the cop let everyone off. Later, I was in a spooky shop where there were lots of Goosebumps books. The cop kept picking on me. This scary dude got Calvin, Silas and Samantha. The cop took me to some strange place with monkeys. There was a pool thing and I didn't want to get in. He looked like Tim Brunero when we were there.",Negative
"I still lived at Dad's old place. I was home alone during the day and just messing about in my room. I heard this weird noise and got up to check but didn't see anything, so went back to my room. I heard it again and again, found nothing. The third time I heard it, I happened to peek into the laundry and saw a man coming through a cat door (we had a cat door in the laundry, but on the side next to where the freezer was, and one on the back door). He had tufts of curly grey hair. I started shouting 'what the hell do you think you're doing?' and he saw me and quickly backed out and ran off. I banged on the door, still shouting. I grabbed a phone and couldn't remember the number for the local police and then I was trying to decide whether I should just call emergency police in case he came back or if I should call Mom or Dad. I went back to the laundry to find him coming in again and I again, started shouting and he backed out and just stood there. I opened the door and tried to find something to scare him with, but picked up a piece of broken glass and slit his throat with it. He fell to the ground and died, blood everywhere. I dropped the glass and went inside. Then there was a knock on the door. There were two men claiming to be from a phone company, but they looked dodgy and had a van in the driveway with no markings. I told them to 'fuck off' and slammed the wood door. I called Mom and asked if she was home and could come round but she wasn't. I said ""I heard a noise and there was a man coming through the cat door in the laundry, so I slit his throat. There are two dodgy guys hanging around outside."" but she didn't seem to really care.  They started making their way out the back, so I went back to the laundry and grabbed the glass and slit another one's throat. Then suddenly the other guy fell back and I saw a guy standing near the shed, who'd thrown a knife at the guy. He said he was a vampire and would take care of the bodies. I was confused, but said ok and went back inside.",Negative

The fellow and I were to write on our cards 3rd shift, which I did. There was another call over the telacall system by us. Bob was lost and we were searching for him. I had an idea we would find him dead, buried under something, or drowned. I thought of how he must of suffered before he died. I found a body, but it wasn't Bob. It was some fat, husky boy. He seemed to be dead and still alive. I left him with a boy and went on searching. Then the boy came up to me with the husky fellow I dug out and he was now just a skinny boy. I saw Bob Lippert sitting on a bench with a husky man. Bob was fat and chubby and had his fat elbow in the husky man's neck, sort of making him sit in an awkward position. I pulled up on a big cable which made some freight cars move. I then pushed it back and they stopped. Then the cars started again and went down the track and up a grade. The last car started back down and I was on the track.

"Dwight and I decide to go out after Grandpa Clyde and his friend to find out where they are fishing so we can watch. It's a secret fishing hole. I go back into the house to get my wheelchair and just then my mother is taking it apart to fix it. I say excitedly, ""I need it now to go somewhere."" She says, ""Well, I just got started. You'll have to wait."" I am frustrated but give up. Then my father is there and he says, ""Well, sometimes Dwight would ride the riding lawn mower."" I say, ""Great, we'll use that."" Now, my father is driving and I am sandwiched between him and Dwight, who sits behind me as I sit behind my father. We bounce and careen over the countryside. I am worried I'll get my feet caught in the wheels and maybe I'll fall off, but I hang on and we make it to where the river is, only we've lost their trail. Now, there are a series of dressing rooms. I peek in one and see a little bathroom next to the changing room. It is a high step up to two toilets. They are not accessible. I go back out and we wonder what to do next. My father sees a phone booth and we push the button to talk with the ranger. My father speaks, calling him Ricardo. The man says, ""My name is Robin."" My father explains, ""We are looking for two men fishing and need to know an accessible way to the river and where they might fish."" He calls him Ricardo again, which annoys the man so I take over and call him Robin, and ask again. He asks what kind of fish they were going for and my father says the name (it starts with a C). I don't tell the ranger the name, fearing it might be illegal to fish for those kind. Robin says he'll be there in a minute to help us out.",Negative
"Marilyn Monroe is being interviewed. She loves drugs: ""I like J&B; Scotch, uppers, downers, and cocaine."" Then a photograph shows first from knees to navel--she's wearing a slight bikini bottom. As experts talk about her, one says, ""She uses drugs like groceries."" Then the photograph is full-length, and I look at her from waist up, as closely as a doctor looks at an X-ray. Her breasts are big and beautiful at a glance. But on a closer look, they are squarish and lumpy. Instead of a nipple, she has three, like end of a Norelco shaver, with each circle smaller but almost as flat. Not sexy at all. Her breastbone just below her neck is a triangular plate just below the skin--all the skin in the upper area from navel up is transparent, like glass or a film negative or a thick plastic where you can just barely see what it wraps. The plate with a button shape in each corner seems to be silver. Below all her skin I see blood vessels as faint blue and nerves as white wires.",Negative
"(12/05/97)[""Uncle Wilbur's empty eye.""]  Sebastian and I are talking. Working on a project. He says perhaps we are all done working with each other now. All our projects together are done.  I feel mild regret. Now I see Uncle Wilbur and go sit on his lap. I look into his eye to see an empty eye socket, with some mechanical device inside which used to hold his eye. There are people around who are mean and grumpy.",Negative
"I was at school and Ms Bigwood gave me this report thing. My best subject was accounting and my worst subject was 'battery' because I was only there for one lesson. Then, I was at a cinema and Dad was there. He was listening to old music on a Foxtel-like screen.",Positive
"I am driving a car but I'm sitting in the back seat, reaching over into the front seat. Lucy is steering (she is blind). I have control of start/stop. She has control of direction. I see for her and tell her how to turn. I am feeling anxious because we could have an accident. I am driving in the snow. I want to turn right. She doesn't turn in time.

"Bonnie and I are on a vacation, traveling. We meet this nice guy who shows us the backwaters of a lagoon. The water has debris and stuff in it like snake-like plants floating in it, etc. He says, ""It used to be cleaner."" We go to his cabin on the other side to visit. He gets food out, an egg, etc. for lunch. He and I like each other. We laugh and joke. It's fun, camaraderie. Bonnie gets sick. I sit with her and say, ""If you were counseling someone who complained of pain like you do, what would you tell them?"" I was trying to get her to be more objective. Then there is a big parade, with lovely Jamaican drums. I enjoy the beat. One of the gloats has a cook making spaghetti with hot sauce for Bonnie. I see Bonnie in the audience. We are sitting in pews. A woman says, ""Wait, your turn is next."" They bring the next float. It has a wedding cake on it. They announce sugarless cake for the guy and myself. I am pleased. I ask what they substituted. It was honey. I start eating. Mabel takes some of the honey away. She doesn't want me to eat too much at once and get sick. I remember eating honey on bread and not getting the irregular heart beat. It is really delicious. Co-worker Tyler is there, talking. Then I'm in a class. I choose a book of Elizabeth Taylor to analyze myself with. It's a study of contrasts, she's beautiful, successful, rich and sexually active... I'm the opposite of all that. There is a poem on the blackboard, something about zoo zoo's and I am trying to figure out the connection to me.",Positive

"I was kept a prisoner in a room which opened into a larger room which was barn-like. I was confined with another man, and I don't remember whether I was he or whether he was somebody else. It seemed that perhaps I was the only prisoner, and that my dream mind was watching the affair sometimes from a distance and sometimes closely. My jailer was a fiendish sort of person who was going to kill me. I wasn't clear why he didn't kill me, since I was in his power. The jailer kept taunting me by running from window to window, peering in and leering at me.",Negative
"I was driving. Carl Fisher was with me. I had my old 29 Ford. I got stalled in the center of the street and I couldn't move. I couldn't get the car in gear. So we left it there and I went to see if I could find a garage and have it towed off the street. I was about a block away and looked around and there were two policemen by my car. One was writing out a ticket. They were gone when I got to the car. I had a ticket on the wiper. I got in the car and the traffic was heavy. A streetcar was behind me, waiting for me to get out of the way. He came close and moved my car a little. I finally put it in reverse and drove to the curb backwards. Eddy P. from Dill's came over. He got in my car with Carl and he drove. I was walking on the city street nude, not a stitch of clothing on. I was embarrassed. I had my arms folded and bent over to cover my sex organs.",Negative

"The next snippet dream is I was in the apartment, I think I had when I was in Springfield and it seems to be that I'm in my living room and I could see the sunlight coming in the window and I was listening to a tape on the tape recorder and my friend G was taping to me and she said that she wants me to copy her tape. I didn't have a duplicator and so it was really funny, I had to take 2 tape recorders, my little one and a larger one and I had them laid out on the floor, on the rug, in the living room of my apartment that I used to have way back in 1983. I was taping the tape and although I thought it was silly, I felt intimidated and thought that I had better do what she tells me and then the dream jumps to work, and suddenly the 2 tape recorders are there and the tapes are being made and I don't want the boss to see it, and he starts to express some kind of disagreement about something one of the counselors was doing and how they had to be away from the offices and how they had to drive away from the buildings and I go in the office and I'm doing my tapes and copying the tapes and I want him to think that its part of work, and then I'm trying to do some other work too. I wasn't sure what else I was doing, using some machine or something, but I had this idea that I had to keep busy and so I was sitting at the desk between the 2 tape recorders and trying to do another task with it so I could keep working.",Negative
"A friend and I were driving to R City. I was combing my hair. I was going to get married. I had impulsively decided to get married and I chose my brother Dwight. Somehow it was O.K. because the reason I was getting married was to keep other men away, so it wasn't incest because we wouldn't have relations sexually. I got to R City and I realized that I forgot to bring my wedding gown. I was embarrassed and felt badly. I called my parents and asked them to bring it down in time for the wedding. I felt badly about asking this favor of them. I could have remembered it in the first place. I always ask my parents to bail me out. I felt guilty. It then occurred to me that if I was getting married, they should want to be there, anyway. It occurred to me then that I was getting married to my brother, and I got cold feet. I got embarrassed. The reason I had earlier, didn't hold up now, and I felt appalled that I would consider incest. I was embarrassed. ""What would people think?"" I remembered that as a younger person, I had really thought it would be nice if I could marry Dwight. I felt repulsed by the idea now.",Negative

Then I go on to give a lecture. A very interesting man in a wheelchair comes up to me to ask me about things. There are other people coming up all the time and I can't get to him. Finally I have a chance. I cross the hall to go to him. It is a light hall (like the one where I had attended a lecture by Laurence van der Post for the yearly lung memorial, when I told everyone I was not going to stay in Switzerland but would move to the United States). As I walk up to him, one of the loves of my youth comes in. I'm very happy to see her, but I also want to get to the man. She faints and finally dances me out the door.

Then I thought I was in an elevator lobby at work, standing, listening to some people talk. Then I recognized my female friend S's voice from New Jersey. She was saying that it costs $6000 dollars per semester to send her son to school. Someone else said ""Boy, how do you come up with that much money?""

"I was at the sleep center and had on an orange-colored wool suit. I didn't have the jacket on. I had a blouse on and the skirt. The skirt was huge. The skirt was way, way too big for me. I was running around trying to find a very big safety pin to try to pin it. I was showing everyone how big it was on me and we were getting ready for a research meeting. Now, I was looking in the cabinets and different things and I saw these front office things like labels. They were in two different cabinets instead of all being in the same place. I wondered why they were in two different cabinets instead of all being in the same place. Finally, someone handed me a large paper clip to hold my skirt. I tried it but it didn't work so I kept looking. I finally found a safety pin and I pinned it. About that time, I noticed Doctor W standing, kind of off in the distance, talking to some woman that I didn't know. I get the impression that she works there but I don't know who she is. Julie Ca was there. Anyway, Doctor W called me over and started telling me about a research study that we were going to be involved in and this woman was going to be involved in it. He told me in front of her that I really am not very knowledgeable about research and so she is going to be very involved in this study. We were in a conference room sitting at this table. All of a sudden, there were many people there. They were all strangers. There was no one else I knew. There is one lady that he had just told me was going to be heavily involved in the research study. I was sitting next to Doctor W. I was having a lot of trouble hearing the conversation. The study was going to be a drug study. Doctor W said something about me not saying anything, but he didn't say it to me. He said it to everybody else. Everybody started making fun of me. Saying things like, Oh Anna can't speak, and things like that. This initial woman that he told me was going to be very involved asked me something about the study. I said, Well, I don't know. I've never been involved in a drug study. Then Doctor W made some other comment that I thought was inappropriate. It was kind of a put down. I started to stand up to ask him to step outside the room with me because I was going to ask him not to berate me in front of other people. I half stood up, then changed my mind and said, well, for the purpose of this study, I'm just part of the research team, okay? Then I sat back down. The meeting continued. Again, I was having a very hard time hearing people. I was really straining to turn my head, really straining to hear what was being said. A couple other people came in the room to join the meeting. Someone said something about talking about something in particular and they were all joking and laughing and one lady said Oh no, no, not me.",Negative

I was combining photos of people and I did Evelyn and Darius. I had recent photos of people at school. I showed Ezra. Mom disappeared and went to this place for bad adults which was next to a place for bad kids. She got out to deal with some killer person. There was some flaming Indian thing.

"I went out hiking with my father, my three siblings, and an uncle. We walked for a good while and then we started to climb a rather steep hill. My sister and I were in the back. About half-way up we heard a noise and then the earth started to shake. it was a strong tremor. My sister and I (holding hands) went down first and we got to a flat area and there was a house (which wasn't there when we went up). From there we saw the rest of them quickly going downhill. Due to the tremor, whose intensity had increased, and to the speed gathered from the descent, they weren't able to stop where we had. Lots of rocks were falling at their backs, but before these could harm them, I awoke. It was a frightening dream; the setting was not familiar.",Negative

"I see Mrs. Wallace (art teacher) and she's talking to other art teachers about how the ""art classes"" she teaches is really basic mathematics. I don't think I take that literally, but I do understand that there's a lot more to do after getting out of high school art classes. Then I'm in Mrs. Pappas's physics class, who actually looks very similar to Mrs. Wallace, and I'm doing a powerpoint or web page presentation on everything from baseball to dreams. The strange thing is that I didn't think I finished the page, but somebody seemed to have finished it for me. Although it wasn't exactly finished very well, it looked like it was possibly enough to get by. I remember talking and talking, and realizing I'd only started talking about the first subject so I decided to briefly mention every other subject in the remaining minute or so I had left. I didn't realize my mother was there watching the presentation, who comments about it to Mrs. Pappas afterwards. Then, I'm talking to Mrs. Jones, another teacher. It's a one on one conversation but all the kids seem to be watching intently. I had a bag with me and told her I wanted to get rid of all my notebooks. She started telling me how good they were for ""easy reference"" and everything like that, and I mentioned they're not all my notebooks (and I'm not throwing all of mine away) someone else had just given me a notebook to throw away for them. Then she asked me why I'm always acting so serious. Then I see Mr. Pons (who always seems serious, but is always using his dry humor to joke about everything). He says something, so I then shout out ""Pon-SON!!!"". I make another joke and then look for my bag, which I find is gone. Mrs. Jones had apparently taken it down to the office or something to donate it to some organization, but I needed some of the stuff in that bag that was still important and I rushed to find her. I saw a school secretary smoking, and wondered why the school was considered smoke-free if she was allowed to do that.",Negative
"Mrs. Dougherty was at our house, and she was laying in bed at night in the dark on Mom's side of the bed, and there was nobody else in the bed, but we were just kind of there doing our thing. And she was laying there and I was standing, and she wanted to know how my singing technique was presently. So she wanted to sing something and have me sing it back, and have her feel how I do it. And so she sings a couple of notes like in a minor key, and it kind of scared me a little and so I grabbed her hand, but then I was okay and I sang it back to her, and she kind of felt how I breathed and how I did it. And I think she wanted to do it a couple more times, and I think maybe we did. And then I laid next to her like I do with Mom, and she held me like Mom does.

"There were ghosts.  A young boy and a girl.  Siblings.  Their father was a very angry man.  I was to take the girl to school.  I had to get dressed, but couldn't find what to wear.  I had on black heels.  It was too risky to take any of their mother's things, despite how elegant they were, the blacks and reds.  I was led into what would normally be my brother Stuart's room, where the girl's things were stored.  She handed me a knit/crocheted type dress.  It was, of course, incredibly short on me, but apparently that was okay.  We were in a rush.  I had to teach at the school.  I went to get the keys.  I didn't know if I was taking my mother's new car, or mine.  Mine was old looking and rusted.  I took my mother's.  It was evil.  My mother and Stuart and I were standing in the kitchen doorway to the living room.  Stuart argued with us, and my mother seemed to be angry or uptight as well.  We had some green blob that we were throwing at the car to calm the evil in it- kind of like spraying the glop in the Statue of Liberty in Ghostbusters two.  Stuart was infected with evil, my mother probably was too.  I threw globules at all of us, and we continued throwing it at the car, still in a hurry.  I went out to the street where the car was parked.  The steering wheel was on the passenger side.  It was not a new car.  It was hard to control.  I had the brake with my left foot.  The accelerator responded far too easily.  I forgot the girl, and took off.  I was driving from above, going that speed, watching the curves in the road.",Negative

The boat is old and wooden. The paint is chipped and peeling. I find my room. It is filled with a couple of old junky metal beds, twin size, and an ugly purple overstuffed chair. Boxes of stuff are laying around, crowded and junky. I start to clean it up. I am sorting piles of papers and so on. I decide to go to the storeroom or the ship's library to get other nicer furniture. I go in and see shelves of video movies. I decide I could watch a movie a day with all this selection. I go back toward the room. Now a man like Chevy Chase likes me. I am attracted to him. I am laying on a berth in a room and I motion to him to come up and join me.

"An alien female is transforming me. I am lying down in the front seat of a car. I am very afraid. She starts at the top of my head and as she slowly moves down to my feet, my bones and body change somewhat painfully, being pulled into another shape. I am now Eva Saint Marie, blonde, beautiful and elegant. My task now is to go to an audition. It is a small coast town and the local community theatre is putting on a play. The director has some important contacts in Hollywood and somehow I, the dream ego, knows Eva will be the right one. Eva goes in and he sees her and instantly knows she is the one. She is elegant, a certain aura or presence that indicates how very special and talented she is. He comes to her right. He is huge, twice as big as her, and puts his hand on her knee. He says, ""Act sexy."" She takes his hand off her knee, looks him in the eye, and then tosses her hair around and looks sexy. He says, ""You've got the part."" She's on her way to stardom. Now she/I goes to her home. She doesn't recognize it as the alien arranged this all, but she knows it's her new home. It is a small cabin behind a big house, very simple and economically furnished, a small refridge, a bed. A man and a small girl live there. They are her family, I guess.

"I was on a hotel vacation with my boyfriend Jeremy.  We were eating leftover bean burritos.  Mine was dripping hot oil onto my hand.  I thought if there was that much oil in it then the beans must have lard and can't be vegetarian.  I gave something away or knew something about a flower.  We were approached by two people telling us about a sales scam, where a $5 investment would yield $5000 profit.  I was skeptical but my boyfriend Jeremy was curious and wanted to listen to the couple's spiel.  Afterward they wanted us to try out the sales technique.  A couple happened to approach us, and we were supposed to try it on them before deciding.  The couple was informed though; they had done their research and they were already interested in the program, so there was actually no convincing involved.  As our first attempt was a success, it would be harder to get away from the scammers, they would have more ground to continue pushing us on.  Then a second couple came in, angry, and asking for their furniture back.  They had already been scammed and their furniture was being used as leverage against them.  Afterward we found out that they were a set-up; they had videotaped the transaction and were going to use it as evidence against the scammers.  I picked up the $5 from the first couple and was going to give it to the, but they told me to keep it.  They knew that we were only victims in the making and weren't mad at us.  We were stuck with the scammers though and couldn't get away from them.  The Mexican man was the 'devil'.  He took over the role of my father.  I wanted my own father back, but I was the only one who had any recollection of my father.  The devil had wiped my mother's memory and she saw him as her husband.  There were no records or pictures of my father, and I would have to comply with the devil's wishes in order to get my father back.",Negative
Talking to Pam Ta about Sophia K not being at group lately and not hearing from her. I was telling Pam Ta how unusual that was. She had told me she wasn't going to be at one meeting but I haven't heard from her since. I was thinking about telling Pam Ta about this in an email. I was thinking that maybe Sophia K was doing this because the last time she missed I didn't write her to tell her we missed or anything.

"The first thing I remember is ""rendering reality."" I don't exactly remember what this entailed the first time I did it, although it involved technology and made the world look much more ""real"". (It's dark, and I'm outside my house). In another part of the dream or sequence I did it a second time though, where turning on 6 switches (2 rows of 3) on the doorway of my house changed the amount of light streetlights were giving out (and changed the number of streetlights that were giving out light. This time I'm disappointed, because it's still very dark. The last time I remember doing this ""reality rendering"" it got very light, so I could see everything around me. This time it wasn't nearly as bright- maybe as bright as a normal waking life streetlight. There were other lights that seemed to be coming from the sides, and the sky, which were not as strong as the normal streetlights but there were many of them and my switches controlled these. Then, I remember eating with some people from my school and forgetting my sandwich at or near the table (coming back to grab it later). A phone call from some girl at school, telling me something, none of which I remember. I thought I knew her by her voice, but by the end of the call I wasn't sure. I go outside, and I am walking (or flying) out to a city that is only a few streets away from my house. I want to use a computer to do some ""reality rendering,"" but I find there are some problems with the computer. I do, however, remember a plastic strip that might have contained electrical information to be read by the computer on the geography of the physical world (which could be used to change my dream world into an exact copy of, or even into the physical world). At this time I am not aware I'm dreaming, consciously, but I am conscious enough to know it's a dream. Somebody tells me to wait around- somebody will try to fix the computer. I decide I'm in a dream, and don't really need this rendering mechanism. I decide I'm going to go and have some fun while I can. In the next segment, I'm leaving my house, suddenly become really lucid, and I head up to Katherine's house. On my way there (it's just a few houses down from mine), there's a man driving a truck down Oak Road, who I hear is looking for retribution on old enemies (from a telepathic voice, or something). I'm a little scared, but I'm not sure it's me he's angry at. I'm not sure I'm still lucid. He drives right up into the driveway or yard of the brown house on the left, hastily turns back toward me, this time with the steering wheel on the opposite side from me. He gets out, and I find it's Joe Pesci. He starts shooting a gun at me, and I try to use his truck as a shield, pleading with him not to kill me. I don't remember what happens, but he shot a lot of bullets and none of them hit me. Then, I'm walking down a street. There are some other people there (friends, dream friends, I don't know). I see my grandfather's old car, and upon coming closer to inspect it, it's not the same car. Then I walk into Gail's house, where there are various people there. I can't really see very well, and wonder if it has anything to do with just having been in the bright sun. I ask for Gail and someone directs me to the right into another room. She's sitting or laying down on the floor. I touch her face, but I can barely feel it. My lockmold* isn't very strong. I have a short conversation with her about a movie and say, ""Do you wanna act it out?"" I wake up, realizing it's 11:00 a.m.",Negative

"(02/28/00)[""Volcano and swimming.""] I am near S City. There is a very steep mountain across the large body of water. And a back murky pond and a narrow channel of water near a house. I think the house is supposedly my parents'. I drove there in my van. My job is to be prepared if the volcano on the mountain blows. I must pack my own things, get them into the van and drive to safety. So I don't really unpack. I just use what I need and put it back in the suitcase. I seem to swim a lot. I dive into the back pond and swim laps. It feels good to be exercising. I swim up the narrow channel as well. I see under a board like a shed wall with a gap at the bottom and see a cat looking back at me. I had wondered what the other person had been looking at. The channel narrows so much and gets so shallow I am practically swimming in mud. It empties out into the large body of water. I think about swimming out there but the water looks rough. Then I see the volcano has erupted. Spewing red lava down the mountain side. I am wondering just how many miles the lava can go. I can't decide if it is safe to stay here or if we should flee. I keep looking at the lava flow. Lots of steam in various parts of the mountain. I decide it is better to flee. I walk to the van and get in. I drive away.",Negative

I wondered then why he was unpacking everything instead of leaving it in the car.  He wore a T-shirt that implied he was a vampire fan.  I thought this was interesting and asked him about it.  It was something that his wife Sheila had gotten him into and I was somewhat surprised, but realized it was totally hypocritical like her, to be a fan of vampires while a Jehovah's Witness.  There was a picture or two of a woman with her breasts exposed, one being quite larger than the other.  It was something he wanted to put up and enjoy while he could, as Sheila wouldn't allow that sort of art.  I was irked at all her influence over him.",Negative

I told her that Diane S, Paulette W, and I have been in school together for 22 years. For one part of the class, there were three different topics that we had to do a presentation on for the class. Two of the topics I was extremely comfortable with, but the third I wasn't comfortable with at all. It was very foreign to me. I had asked the one instructor if we could split them up or if we had to do all three topics at once. I explained to her that if we could split them up I would be very comfortable doing either of the first two topics at any time and even going first if she would like. The other one, however, I would really need to do some work on so I was not comfortable being the first presenter if I had to include it at that time. However, they scheduled me to be the first presenter and I still had to present all three topics because they couldn't be split up. I was meeting with the one instructor individually to help me understand exactly what needed to be covered in each of these presentations. We also talked some about my background. She, too, was very comfortable with me being ready to present the first two topics because of my background and experience. For the third topic, she was trying to help me understand it well enough so I could do a good job on that presentation.",Positive

There the doorman could get a taxi for me and I could whirl away. However, I only got halfway down the staircase and then turned around and started back.

"There was as trailer truck that had delivered some gardening supplies to my house. I had some left over and so they were returning them to the garden supply store. I guess I had followed him in my car. He pulled up along the front of the store but he stayed in the street. Along one side of the store was a chain link fence. On the outside of the truck was a metal frame. The trailer had a metal frame with canvas sides that you could unhook to get to the stuff that was on the trailer. I had climbed up on the outside of this trailer to unhook the canvass so we could unload the extra stuff that we were returning. I was trying to hold on. There were two places, one at the top and one at the bottom where the canvass needed to be untied. Then there were two places in the middle that had metal clips that you had to squeeze to take off of whatever it was attached to. I was concerned that he had left the truck in the street because I knew it was blocking traffic. I wanted to get it unloaded as quickly as possible. I was trying to hold on with one hand and undo the canvas with the other. I had let go with both hands because I needed both hands to undo the canvas, then I grabbed back on. After I did it I thought it was strange that I didn't fall when I let go with my other hand. I got the one side undone and the truck started rolling forward. I got in front of it and just pushed it with my hands back some so it wouldn't roll forward. As I did this the trailer moved at an angle towards the fence. I actually think it bumped up against the fence. That also stopped it so it roll again. There were 2-3 men that came out of the garden supply store and picked up all of the stuff that I was returning. There were also some little things like little metal clips or something that the also picked up. I think I picked up one of those and the last bag of whatever it was that I was returning. They were all bags of peat moss or mulch I'm not sure. As they grabbed everything and got it off the trailer and were returning it I made the comment that there was one bag of something else that I needed to take with me.",Negative

"I had just secured a job working here locally for NASA. Our quadrant was in the middle of a crisis. NASA had commercial airliners and one of the pilots had crashed a plane intentionally. At first they did not realize that he had survived until a subsequent incident. Two pilots, a husband and wife, were sent on a mission to try to stop the criminal pilot. The husband was Anthony Edwards, actor. I walked/ran with them through many of the checkpoints/security clearance points to get them securely into their aircraft. I was in training. I was trying to get security clearance and the equipment was not taking my SS number. I realized that someone had entered a 0 before the number and that was causing the malfunction. No one knew who had done it so we suspected the criminal pilot. I was the first to realize the criminal pilot had survived when I saw him reappear, almost as though it was a scene in a movie. He came up from the ground in a very surreal/ghostly manner. In another scene I was having anxiety about accepting a position with NASA. I wasn't at all sure I was up to the task. I kept telling myself that I had to give myself time to learn the ropes and I had to maintain my confidence. I met a woman who had not been working there very long. She had names in blocks on a clipboard and some were scratched out. I realized that she was fairly new, not as new as me, learning and making mistakes also. I found that very reassuring. I went to my station, standing at a piece of computerized equipment. I remembered that Raina D worked for NASA and decided to call her and let her know that I was working there. We spoke for a little bit on the phone. After getting off the phone I knew she would tell Barry C about this and that might change his mind a little about me. I decided to go to lunch. I went and changed into shorts and sandals so I could exercise on my lunch break. Raina D showed up at my station and warned me. She asked me if it was okay to take my lunch break now. She told me they are very particular about things like this. There was a gentleman working at a station right next to me that she knew. I had not been introduced to him yet. She introduced us and told me that he is a great source of information and I should ask him any questions I have. As she was telling me this I was slipping on the sandals.

As we went on I saw more pheasants. Before we got on to the main road leading to town, we stopped the car in order that some of the guys could get completely dressed. It irritated me that they didn't finish dressing before we left the house to go to eat.",Negative
I am to meet Hillary and her kids. I procrastinate and finally leave about 5PM. I call her up to say that I took a later bus. I get there before her and while waiting we make a statue on a wooden frame with clothes draped around it. What to use for a head? a melon. Hillary arrives before we finish.,Positive
"I was in a bedroom and was awakened and saw M. and two others in a narrow bed. They had been away. I said, ""They don't notice us. I'll wait to welcome them later and will sleep longer."" I put on my old pink dress. R. asked what length I wore my dress. I said this one was shorter than most. I shortened it when skirts were shorter. Someone admired the dress. Then the doctor was to examine me. I took off all my clothes except bra and old fashioned open drawers. He said he wanted a sheet. R. had the sheet and cutting folds apart partly slit the sheet. It will have to be mended.",Positive
"I had two apartments.  The second looked more run down.  The bed was against a window, and you could see the neighbor as the walls were windows.  I realized I would have to pay rent on both apartments, so it wasn't worth having one for only two days a week because the commute was better for those days.  I asked my boyfriend Jeremy which apartment he liked better.  For some reason he liked the second one, and I was disappointed.  I liked the other much better.",Negative
"I was in my classroom at the university talking with some friends, when the professor came in with some exams we had taken. He started to give out the exams. I didn't want him to give me mine, because I thought I had flunked. But I went to the table where he was and I saw that I had 100 on my test, but then I saw that the grade was 50 instead of 100, but it really wasn't 50, but 95. and then it was transformed into 93, and that was my grade on the exam. He gave me the test and I felt a great relief.",Positive

"We were only in bed about 15 minutes when I had this dream that an oil tank somewhere was going to blow up. I just knew it! That's the dream where Mary says that I woke up and started shouting: ""The oil tanks going to explode!"" I remember being around where there was a lot of dirt, we were outside and why I knew that it was going to explode, I don't know. It was warm outside and I felt the dirt. The violence of that dream sent me into a really frightened state. The oil tank never exploded and the plane never crashed and I don't know if the dogs ever died.",Negative
"I apparently now live in a very large house, but only use a couple of the rooms. My cousin says to me, ""Perhaps you will take in Deirdre. She could live with you."" I feel the woman's need to better the situation of her child. I look into the bright green eyes of the child (perhaps middle school or early high school age). I say, smiling, ""I'd love to have a child with green eyes and green hair."" It is really blonde hair but she has a huge green hair ribbon on. Those eyes are an illuminous bright green, a very unusual color for eyes. She is happy. I tell her she has to fit into the routine and get up at this hour and do this and that and then we'll all get along well. I think it will be more work, with the baby I already have, but it will be OK. I wonder if she will go to W. High School. Now the scene shifts and I am talking to the principal, a tall, large man. I am investigating what seems to be a racial discrimination situation. I am a journalist in attitude. At first the principal is hostile and defensive. I guess he thinks I am accusing him. I keep interviewing people and the focus shifts bigger and bigger until the principal says, ""Ah, I see. You are now looking at Universal Peace, not just a discrimination thing for one person."" He relaxes and is helpful.",Positive
"I was getting in the car and two people we didn't like were there. The Winchesters (Supernatural) had a little sister. I didn't like her. She was with us, in the backseat between Ezra and I. Dad was driving and Dean (Supernatural) was in the passenger seat. Up ahead, at the lights, there were people washing car windows. There was a scantily clad woman with big boobs. Dean and Dad both commented, Dean said ""She has a nice... pencil"". She came to the window and she and Dad flirted. She said that not many good-looking, funny, single guys around. There was a pause and then Dad asked for her number and she gave it to him. Then we were at Nana's. She was there. The inside was different. There was a warehouse and they had copies of my chair there, but they went back more and were recliners. Poppa was in there. I left the warehouse and it was near where the water tank was, at the top of the path next to the fish pond. There was a duck on the bridge. It followed my movements, so I ran, screaming, up and closed the gate. Nana got it and I ran inside.",Negative
"I was at Nana's. There was a broom placed across the ramp to the back door. I asked why later on but I never got an explanation. Dad said he noticed the shoes had been put away and I realised I didn't take my shoes off before coming in. Someone was singing 'The Way It Is' and I went down the ramp near the granny flat. The geese and chickens were there and I squealed. Poppa was there and he tried to scare them away. I went inside and Ezra got a guy to call Uncle Vic (who was there) and tried to sell him something. There was a thing on TV with Alison Brie, then a thing with Chevy Chase and I said 'he's everywhere'. I said something to Ezra like 'I'm Chevy Chase and yeah, no"" in an American accent. I tried to rewatch Juno and it was different and not as bad, but still bad and I said 'I can't watch this'. Mom and I went to a petrol station and I asked for a chocolate. The security guard got in the driver's seat and messed with the lights and we were confused.",Negative
"There was a prisoner. He was locked in a room sort of in a basement, but not quite--a separate room--a pod at the high school. He was going to be released the next day. I could hear him over the intercom crying. He wanted to talk, so I said OK, come talk and he left the locked room. Before daylight I walked along down the hall I saw 2 women security guards looking at his cell. They were dragging the bottom of a drainage pit, with pipes. An iron gate was over it, to see if he had hung himself. I was walking in a mall and went in a store, when I thought it was a thrift store. An attempted too-sexy girl with red/white flowered, split-legged pants languished on the counter in a pin-up position with her middle-aged boss in a suit. The clothes were cheap and over-priced. I looked and left. At another store me and Evelyn were looking at bras. One was too big. It was green. Stretchy lace. The others were bright primary shades of cotton. 2 colors each (blue/red, red/yellow, blue/yellow) Rudy was in a swim meet, up on the starting block. I was cheering him on. The gun went off. The others dived in and Rudy stood ready. I pushed him in. I didn't realize it wasn't time for him to swim yet. I made him get a false start. After this happened a few times, he gave me a black waterproof time watch to wear on my arm. It was a watch too. I was sitting in the creek. My legs were bruised with some lacerations. I was trying to push a pill through my skin to heal. It was where my mother had hit me. My mother got a camera to take a picture of it. The picture showed one of my hands on my leg. But she insisted it was a boys hand on my leg and screamed. She said she'd only caught both hands on the film she'd know who it was. I knew she would not believe me, so I didn't try to explain. We were in a cavernous big auditorium, on the way to high school elections. There were 3 guys running. None of them were from our school. One of them was sitting on the floor voting for himself repeatedly. One was handing out bookmarks. One was drawing pictures of himself. People were forgetting to vote.",Negative
"I got taken to some place after university. There were lots of people there and some groups were wearing uniforms. They were teenagers. I sat down and Calvin was there. I was like 'where the hell are you and what are we doing' and he said he didn't know. He said something I didn't hear and he stared, waiting for a reply. I went off at one point and the rooms were confusing. Farrah was there and she was trying to hide from some woman but she came in and caught her. I was then at Dad's old house but it was different. I was in my room but it was windy and it broke the back door (it was flimsy). I wondered how Dad had lived here. I got up and closed all the doors.",Negative

I ran upstairs and got changed and got my calculator and stuff. Darren was asleep on their bed. I went to the kitchen and there wasn't much food. I grabbed a muesli bar and went back down. Ezra said it was too late and it was nearly 9.30, though the clock said 10.18 (it was an hour fast). I fell to my knees and cried and was crying out that I was going to get like 5% average and that I'd be lucky if I got a TER of 1. They ignored me and commented on the neighbour's lawn.",Negative

"A married couple lives in a house and Jennifer H lives with them. I sort of am Paulina sometimes, but most of the time I am an observer following her around. Paulina knows there's going to be trouble because the husband is beginning to be attracted to her. She asks me to call Lucy so she can get advice. I have a phone receiver at each ear and am listening to Lucy and Paulina talk. I hear someone pick up an extension and realize the wife is listening in and hope she hasn't heard enough to give it all away. She comes into the room and I hang up the phones. The husband comes into the room and the wife leaves. I have on thigh high black nylons and I show him a dress I've bought that is very short and sexy. He likes it. I put it back in the box and Paulina/me stands to walk out of the room. She is dressed in a simple black wool dress that accents her small waist and slim figure. A kick pleat at the back calls attention to her legs. She's wearing black high heels. The husband is very attracted. Paulina walks out of the room, mincing on the high heels like a Hollywood starlet. I follow her. As she walks down a hall, a good-looking young man sees her and follows her, attracted. She hears boogie woogie music and is going in search of the music to dance. She is sidetracked somehow in a dark hall that has a series of glass tanks like for reptiles or fish. People are in the bottom tank, trapped. She watches as they dig up to the top layer tank, but it has fish and water in it, no oxygen, so they dig further to the next bottom tank and then up. This time there is a black poisonous snake in the top tank and oxygen. A man standing next to me on my left is also watching. He casually picks up the snake to hold it while the people break through into the snake's tank. I say, ""Be careful!! He's very poisonous."" The man is not at all concerned and holds it like a pet and lets it writhe around his hand and arm, only carelessly paying attention to where the head is. Then the snake tries to bite the boot of the man and hits the floor with drops and a shooting spray of the white poison. ""See,"" I say, ""Look out."" The man ignores me. The snake is sheathed from neck to tail in segments of cloth that serve as bandages. but are almost like clothes. The people manage to get to the oxygen so I leave and now see Paulina bouncing down the hall to the music. She almost passes the door where they are taking tickets. She hurries in and I follow. She goes across the room past an empty, carpeted dance floor where young collegiate guys are hanging out, and sits. As I reach where she is, I see she's changed her mind and has gone to sit in the middle on rows of chairs. She sits and lays two coats on the empty chairs to her right. The young man who followed her sits in a row in front of those two chairs with the coats. I sit on one of the coats next to Paulina. Now the dance instructor is there and she's talking the us and she nonchalantly takes all her clothes off as she lectures. Everyone is very shocked. I am queasy because I see her breasts and the nipples are sliced off. The red part is very large and where the nipples should be is a cavernous hole like in a thunder egg. It made me hurt just looking at it. Her body is not particularly pretty and the young college men are shocked and not too thrilled. She says that the body is a natural thing and should be treated that way; hence, she does not wear clothes.",Negative
"Ezra had some friends over. I went to have a shower. I had a feeling that someone was going to open the door so I wrapped a towel around me. Then all of Ezra's friends came running in one by one (Clayton, Leroy and Emery). Afterwards I discovered that they had taken photos. Dad said that ""one wants to have sex with you"" and I was like ""What the hell? Ew!"". The photos didn't show anything except ""two and a half"" showed my bum.

"(10/10/99)[""Asking for information about dreams from a well-known author of books about dreams.""] I am in a hotel room. I had picked up some special odd looking pictures I wanted to make. I now look more closely at them and see that it is a rectangular picture frame with a needlepoint canvas stretched on it. A saying is already worked on the canvas in orange yarn. The frame and canvas is then enclosed in a mess like cloth. I decide I made a mistake. Maybe I'll take the mess off and rework my own picture of a dream on this canvas. But the saying is in the way. I would have to undo her work (the author's) to do mine. Seems a lot of work. Now I am reading the manual of instructions with it. I see some new categories she has added to her usual list. I read them and think how odd. They seem minor and trivial, not helpful to the dreamer. Maybe just stuff that's in her dreams. Then I see her walking down the hall and I call out to her. I try to be friendly and non pushy but am a bit apprehensive she will snub me because of our previous encounters. She is friendly however and I politely say I have some questions about her dreamwork books, two of which I bought. I ask hr the questions and she responses with some general answer.",Positive

My erection extends out from my body, more than upward. I ejaculate onto Wally. My cousins Anna Strange, and either Bertha Strange or Archie Weber are there. They may laugh at this. It is later that night. I wake up at 4:30am. I want to masturbate, and to give Wally fellatio, to make him ejaculate. He is sleeping on a nearby couch. I am thirsty. I go to the kitchen to get water. All the lights are off. I wonder if the other relatives have arrived since I've been sleeping. I turn a light on. It is not a kitchen light, but a living room light. People in the living room stir and moan. I see that several people are on the couches: Anna, Bertha, my uncle Dannie Redding, and others. I try to shut the light off, fiddling with different switches. Anna gets mad at me. I say I hit the wrong switch. I'm glad I know that others are around.

"I went to a high school to give a talk. There were TV media there. I was on the gym floor sitting on a bench in the middle of the floor. The students were all on one side in the bleachers. They were very poorly behaved. I said something to the media person with a microphone. It was not until this time that I realized they were students. When I arrived at the school, the driveway and parking were very odd. It was as if I was driving down steps and then had to park on one side angled toward the direction I had come in. When I got ready to leave, I was told I had to leave in the direction I was headed when I came in. This was very awkward because of the direction of the parking I also did not know my way going that way. They told me to go the end, take a left, and then right. That I couldn't get lost. When I turned right, I was in something resembling a very narrow alley, one car width wide. I don't recall seeing building but there was a chain link fence and a lot of gates. Every few hundred feet I had to stop and open a gate. It also kept making turns. I was getting frustrated, upset, and angry. I left my car, threw some kind of very large square board to the side, and continued on foot. I came to a bunch of houses and was walking through their yards trying to figure out where the road to the highway was. I finally asked for directions at one house. A man and woman gave me directions but then she suggested that he take me back to my car and then lead me where I needed to go. He did. As we approached my car, he sympathized with me and told me they shouldn't have done that. He especially pointed out that the place I got out of my car was an especially hard place.",Negative

There was a van in the middle of the carpark and it had this big gun looking needle and you had to do it yourself. Joey and Jack went first and put ice all over their arm to numb it. Jack said it would hurt like hell in the morning. I decided not to do it. Jen anxiously waited for her turn. Then I decided to do it. I got in the back of the car and asked Jack what to do. He said to make a small cut on my hand, so I tried but I couldn't get it big enough so I asked what next. He told me about the ice.

"Bruce W was in the hospital and I went to see him. When I walked into the hospital, the area that I was in had an escalator and was open to the second floor so I could see a lot of people in the open area of the second floor, some standing around the escalator. I immediately noticed Bill F standing facing the escalator and leaning on the half-wall next to it. One of my nieces or nephews was standing next to him. I went up the escalator and was surprised to see how many family members were there. My parents and all of my siblings were there as well as some of my nieces and nephews. Bruce W's mom was there as well as Aunt H and Aunt P. There was a fourth woman there that I referred to as one of their sisters but it wasn't my mother. The open area on the 2nd floor was fairly large. I went over and spoke with Bill F first and then some of my other immediate family. Then I went over and spoke with my aunts. They were all standing side-by-side in a row. I put my arms out and around the two on the end giving them a group hug. I noticed they were all wearing all black.

"Green Carpeted Ramp  I'm with a woman who may be my college economics teacher, in her car. She needs to find a cash machine. We find one at a school, and she gets out to get cash.  Then I am driving with my mom. I'm telling her about my medicine that I take twice a day. It's getting dark. We drive by a huge company building. There are four or five huge garbage cans around the side of the building, built into the walls. There is a huge parking ramp in which our car is parked. My mom and I walk to the top level. It's late, most people have gone home, and the rest are leaving. Our car is parked right at the edge of the ramp, for which there are no walls, only metal cord going around the edge. I'm afraid we'll drive off the edge. The top of the ramp is covered with green plastic-like carpeting. My mom drives well, and we maneuver around a car and exit safely.  I'm in back of a house that feels like Sjogren's house, which I used to deliver papers to in Oak Valley. There is a rabbit wrapped up in a cocoon-like structure, like a white web. It comes out. At first, I think it's a deer; it's brown. Then I see it's a huge gray rabbit! It talks to me like it's a baby. It helps me put big chunks of split wood in a baler.

"It was an especially bleak day and I was walking with a friend of mine (girl) along the path around W Park Lagoon. I was carrying a flat, blunted rock. My friend stepped down from the path to test the ice in the lagoon, and I realized I was tired of carrying the rock. I let it go, and without my intending it to, it struck my friend in the back. She fell to the ice, evidently unconscious, and a deep, black hole appeared in her back. I had a feeling of horror but helplessness. At this point of the dream events became confused, but when they cleared, I was lying on the path, pretending either that I was ill or had fainted, and several of my friends (girls, whom I remember as knowing but cannot now identify) was standing around me, discussing how I should be punished for having injured my friend. Interpretation To hit my friend with a rock, even if accidentally done in the dream, would probably indicate repressed hostility toward her, although I can think of no reason for that feeling. Pretending to be unconscious, as an escape mechanism, seemed to be a familiar feeling in the dream. Perhaps it stems from an occasion when I was in elementary school, and, being pelted by snowballs from a tomboy school acquaintance, fell down in a snowbank and pretended to have been injured.

"I was at a restaurant with my family.  After looking at the menu, I asked my mother to order something for me and I went to the bathroom.  I think I was in the shower, yet also talking to my best friend Emma on the phone.  My mother came in and I reminded her of what I wanted to eat.  There had been some confusion over which menu, the full one or the lunch menu, and the item I wanted to couldn't be found.  I told her one thing on the menu, or if they could do it, another one without the tuna.  Then it was time to go and we walked outside.  My brother Stuart was still holding and munching on some fish sticks he had gotten.  They saved me some sort of breaded appetizer, but no meal.  I felt incredibly sad and unloved.  When we got home I sat down and I was sort of waiting for someone to ask what was wrong, to even notice that something was wrong.  No one had by the time I woke up, and I felt very lonely.",Negative
"I was a Jewish man.  I had a cross-stitched shirt by my daughter.  I was in the garage of a neighbor's family.  Like sitting on the steps of our garage leading into the kitchen.  I wrote with chalk on what looked to be a chalkboard, called a Grimwald board.  (For Crayons only).  My daughter told me this, I believe, after I'd returned home.  I snuck back into the house to try to erase what I'd written so I wouldn't get in trouble.  There was a monkey on the shelf the family was going to fix for dinner.  I told him to hide in the attic.",Negative
"I went to hear the Passion Music. There was a strange thing about the concert, every number was to be repeated by the audience unaccompanied and from memory. The results were discordant.... My father drove a nail through his hand.... I sat through a lecture by Doctor H. It must have been very dry for I busied myself in attacking a handsome new desk with a big chisel. When I had cut a hole in it more than a foot square I was overwhelmed with boyish fear and remorse and forthwith woke up.",Negative
"A secret door.  I started to go through the back door. 2 men were blocking the way.  I shut the door and went through a side secret door. It led to an old abandoned room. Somehow I had made a time change. I was back in pre-historic times, in a cave. I stood near the mouth of the cave and an eerie light (green phosphorous) shone on me. I cast my image out into the night to look scary. It scared the natives. I saw some children swimming from school, raging water. This was ordinary for them. 1 girl had to walk on land the long way around. The clansmen talked about raising the bridge the children walked on so it was above the water in storms so they wouldn't have to swim so dangerously. I met a man, a caveman. I was intelligent and seemed to know things (realized memories from modern times would unconsciously filter through and I would solve problems). Others felt nervous about me, because I was so good at figuring things out. A plane landed on the swimming place. A man got out, and pushed the light craft up to shore so it wouldn't float away.

"For some reason we were up in Jackson visiting family, and we were in this restaurant that was called Celine Dion's Restaurant. And we were coming up the steps and we saw her get out of a limousine and I shook hands with her. And then we went in the restaurant to sit down and eat, thinking she'd come in the restaurant, but she didn't. We never saw her again. We went to this area that supposedly the family owned, and it was, it had this little nativity scene thing set up, and we were looking for the baby Jesus in the nativity scene, and we were like unlocking the manger, looking in there, and we didn't see it. And there were a bunch of tropical plants and things around, and then all of a sudden I was at school, taking the elevator to the third floor; I don't know exactly why, but I guess I had to talk to somebody. Later on, when I was at home, Dad said that he wanted to have some of that land that the family owned, and Uncle Fred was kind of like how he wanted most of it, and... [end].",Positive
"I was at a water thing. I went in the water with my head popping out of the jetty. I was then at a park near it. I was friends with Froggy, which was a green crocodile. Some guy came up to me and tried to steal my phone. I was trying to punch him but it was slow, so I kicked him to the ground. His mate said something about his mother, he cried and then left.",Negative
"I can't believe the bizarre dream I had last night. First of all I dreamt that Samantha and Sandra were in town and we were going to go to dinner with Pavarotti. [laugh] And we were waiting and waiting and waiting at their little apartment, and he never showed up. So we thought, ""Fine, we're just going to dinner ourselves."" Well, we never did go to dinner. We brought them home, and I was like typing up a storm because it was Sunday night and my essay was due on Monday. And I also had my vocabulary to do, and I was thinking maybe I could handwrite it, but I wouldn't get very far. And so typing up a storm and also something happened to the computer, and it gets this weird thing going on, like it shows the keyboard on the screen like highlight the letters as you type them. And in order to get rid of this, we have to like do a whole bunch of ""escape"" and all this stuff, and I haven't even saved my work to a floppy. And then I wake up with a start and I realize that the whole time I was typing I wasn't writing my essay, I was describing and writing about the system, the system from my EJ thing that's called the Escort 2000. And I wake up with a start and I realize my essay is already turned in. I turned it in on Friday, and I like breathe a sigh of relief. [laugh]",Positive

Talking to someone about Jennifer C at the CAS office ordering office supplies and there being something not right with the financial part of that - like they're trying to cheat the office supply company. I told them that I saw one of her supply orders and I noticed that she had deducted a certain amount from the total due. It made me suspicious. Bill defended here saying it was a special deal or a coupon. Ordering supplies for SAID.,Positive
"In this dream I received a letter from my girl who is a young nurse two years younger than myself. I was reading her letter but could not make out any of her words. I turned to the last page and the words became clear. She had written that she has met another young man who was a young doctor and had fallen in love with him. She said she loved him because he was so sophisticateed and that all the young girls were crazy about him. She realized that this would surprise me, but that she hoped that I would not be hurt and that we could still be friends. I felt very hurt and angry and the more I thought of this the madder I got.",Negative
I went to this girl's house and she had a voice fader on her C.D. player. Her name is Cara and she is a new friend of mine. I had never seen her house before - we were in her bedroom. I asked her if I could use her voice fader to block out Mindy McCready's voice (a country singer) from her CD so I could tape just the music and use it in a singing competition. She told me I could if I paid her and I said OK.,Negative

Mother and Daddy and I are in a store room-like affair where the shopping baskets are kept in long diagonal rows.  There is a clock on the wall.  When the boy comes back, we thank him very much, and daddy takes out his change and sees he only has a nickel and some pennies.

"I was at school and it was really weird and like Hogwarts. Someone said that it was a 'magic' school. There were big waves and me and two guys climbed this thing, but when we got to the top, the wave was gone. We went into this 'building'. We sat in chairs and this guy whistled and a wave came over. My ears felt funny. We had to move as other people were getting seated. The chairs were really comfy. There was a whistle, and then an earthquake. Some people were testing out weapons which were causing the waves and earthquakes. We had to keep moving. Orlando Bloom was there?",Positive

"It was the same dream I recorded on 1/20/97 at 8:22. (""I was in the dining hall at my camp and we were singing camp songs really loudly and having a great time.

I then saw my mom rushing by and I asked her to make a list of the clothes I wanted."")

I was lying in bed. My uncle came into the room. He said something about the development of aortic arches. Then my uncle was replaced by my former piano teacher (male). He started to talk about doughnuts and tubes. Piano teacher said each doughnut weighed one pound because of these special tubes. Therefore a dozen weighed two ton. He asked me if I'd like a doughnut. Then the front wall of the bedroom was gone. Instead there was a baking shop. He got a bag of doughnuts. He showed me the doughnuts with tubes. He offered me a doughnut. I took one.

"I was working and was going out after lunch to a store. I made a long jump on to a fence and then went over. I had a job. It seemed I was a guard or something. I was lying on top of a covered high tank and watching. I saw people running down the road. I didn't know why I was in a car going at a high rate of speed, sitting in the back and watching the one man especially running down the street. Then I looked ahead and noticed no one was driving my car. I was in it alone and a black horse was standing in the road blocking it. A policeman was holding on to his rein trying to pull him off, but he wouldn't budge. I applied my brakes and started to slow down and I saw someone turn a sprinkling hose towards the horse and he finally moved off the road. I heard someone say he was the Thastle Down Star. I looked at a board that had printing of him, so I could see the name of the horse, but awoke before I could see it. I was drinking whiskey. A friend poured me a beer glass about _ full and I drank most of it. Then gave Ed J. the rest. Then I drank a bottle of beer. There were small screws on the floor that I made and I was sort of skating or rolling on them with my feet. I seemed to be perched up so high on a seat or something and when I was coming down, I told one of the fellows that we are getting higher by the day. I was nervous when I was getting down from the height. I was in a shoe store. Denny C. was asking me if I wanted to buy a pair of shoes and I said I had enough shoes now. Then I was sitting with some people at the Bailey shoe dept. When the clerks came in to wait on us, I told the clerks who was ahead of me and then I told them that a cheap shoe was just a cheap shoe. There was no sale on good shoes. I got talkative. I said a man's shoe that is less than $14 was a cheap shoe. I told them if a woman pays $4 for a pair of shoes, she is buying a cheap shoe. She must pay $8 or more to get a good shoe.",Negative
"I had a strange dream within a dream kind of thing last night. I guess I was doing psych research or something with this boy and his mother, but there dreams were so real that they would wake up and have things fro the dream. I went into the boy's dream and he was remembering when his father was riding a horse and had really scared him (the little boy). I can't remember the mom's dream, but it was something more related to my life. It was scary for those dreams to be so real, even though they weren't mine. And I had to get out of their dreams first before I could get out of my own dream. I had to consciously wake myself up.",Negative

"I dreamed I was in New York and I was watching this man who was standing on the sidewalk selling some tiny poodles. They looked like poodles and that's what he was calling them, but they were about the size of Chihuahuas. A lady came along with a little poodle of her own and she said her poodle needed a companion, so she'd buy one and how much were they? $5. She thought that was pretty reasonable, so she'd take this particular one. Then the man put it into this paper sack with this leash and said that would be $7, $1 for the sack and $1 for the leash. She paid it. Her car was right across the street. It was a little green VW. Then they went over and she got in. I got in somehow and it was in the back seat. The man put the dog in the back seat. Then when he was getting out, he put it in a big pocket of his coat and walked back. I figured this was his racket. I told the lady what he had done. Then I ran down to this policeman who was standing on the corner and told him exactly what happened. The man had to give the dog back. Then something complicated happened because now my husband and I were here and we were doing something on the street for some reason. It was almost 5 in the afternoon. The policeman said we had better get out of here while we could because the 5 o'clock traffic jam was going to start in a few minutes. Right now we could make a but U-turn and go back the way we came and when the rush started, we wouldn't be able to turn around anywhere for about 20 miles. Somehow we didn't get turned around in time and then I was walking the way we would have gone. I understood why you couldn't turn because it was a tiny road. It was much too small for a car as far as that went. It was out along the bay and there was this overhanging cliff which was so low down that you could hardly even walk on the road. I was walking along the edge of the water. We walked along and went somewhere to meet some other people. It was rather pretty. There were trees and the grass was real green and there were various kinds of birds around. I just kept walking down this little road.",Negative

I hear her say: ""I feel that you have a secret love-hate relationship that is tearing you apart.""

"I looked at the results and saw Uptrend 2nd 27.00. Ann and I were on a vacation for 2 weeks. We had another week to go. We were going to go to Niagara Falls for a week, but she wanted to come home first. I said, ""We will not go home, just to Niagara Falls from here."" Barbara was home taking care of our home. I was walking thru mud with Grandpa. He was sort of apologizing for what he did to me in a round about way. I was sleeping in my top shirt only, so in my dream I was walking in Rivertown in my shirt only. I was ashamed, but didn't meet no one. I got into the house and my sister Ann was in the kitchen. I had a hard-on, so I asked if she would lay for me, and she said, ""I am afraid to get knocked up."" I said, ""You don't have to worry about that."" So she lay on her back.

"I'm in some strange mall with Joey and Shawn and we're looking at sweatshirts that are on sale. They're like Hurley and Vulcan and others and weird clothes too. Then Shawn says, ""Let's go surfing,"" so all the sudden we have our wet suits on and our long boards and we're walking through the mall to the center of the mall, and now we're standing waiting for something to happen. With a rumble a huge tidal wave crashes through the mall. I miss it, but Shawn and not Joey, but Kyle get it, and when the next wave comes, this time I do catch it and start riding through the mall. I get hung up on a wall, but somehow keep momentum. When I reach the big room where I was trying on sweatshirts, I go airborne and fly high into the air. As I fall down, I grab onto a structure and don't land hard. Then I see all the ""regulars"" that most surf this mall all the time, and they seem unimpressed, like it was lame of me to fly through the air like I did. I'm just like, ""Whatever!"" and then I wake up.",Negative
"All I can recall is that it seemed to have something to do with the experimental situation. At one point it seemed as if I were more aware of some activity going on, which I think were eye movements. I'm not sure whether it was that something had caused the eye movements or whether it was to be that the eye movements were the cause of something else. At one time there was an impression of looking at a piece of paper and in a sense there were four parts underlined. These were in the lower part of the paper and there was a small one to the left and right and then a larger something to the bottom left and right. The small things were more or less centered over the large things so that the four underlinings had a symmetrical appearance (although they were definitely at the bottom of this paper or page). It seems like they were words, which were underlined, but I can't make them out. It seems as if the group of smaller words were underlined. Then the groups of larger words were underlined as if that was to be the sequence of direction, as if the small one were to be in each case followed by the large one.",Positive

"Somehow, Tyrion (Game of Thrones) and I were romantically involved. We would sneak off to these other castle buildings -- there was a big castle thing which was the main place and then there were lots of little buildings around. We were sitting in one, holding each other and talking. He wanted to give up his inheritance to run off with me. Later, we walked out of the castle together and people were watching, so I said ""I'll go walk around and meet you"" and smiled.

I must be late and opening the door I see the janitor is cleaning. I am too late. It is 6:45 as I leave. If I don't get a bus soon I'll walk to King Street. Near the bus stop are two rows of people; in front are all small children. But as this isn't the stop, I start walking to King Street but I'm not on the main road and this one is blocked with trucks and men building the road. I get by and three men join me and we hunt the way to the main road but have to leap ditches, climb ruins, and still don't get to the road.

"I was in a classroom with the rest of my class (8th grade). Steve, our teacher and principal, was calling up, one by one, the people with long hair and cutting their hair so that it was about jawbone length. I was the last person to be called up. I ran away and tucked my hair into my sweatshirt so that it looked like I had short hair already. Everybody looked at me like I was just being stupid, so I went over to Steve. I had to keep telling him not to cut it so short. It seemed like he finally cut it just above shoulder length. Then I was at home and looking in the mirror in my room. My hair was just below shoulder length. I wondered for about 20 seconds about why he had cut it shorter. I figured I just didn't see where Steve cut my hair. Then I noticed that my hair looked good at this length and looked at the mirror for a while. Setting: Most of it took place in the classroom at my school. Some of it took place in my room. Characters: Steve Smuin is my teacher and the school principal. My whole class, the whole 8th grade, was in the dream. I know them all. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, worried, surprised. I felt like this really happened. One weird thing that I just realized is that my hair in the dream was straight, smooth, shiny. This wasn't really out of the ordinary. If it weren't for the hair-cutting, I wouldn't even have noticed it as a dream, not a memory. The feelings I had were really normal for being at my school.",Negative

There is also a culvert on this side and in the culvert ditch is a half grown rabbit. There are other rabbits in the filed. I pick up the young rabbit, intending to transfer it to opposite side of field where there is a deep ditch, and much rougher land -- where rabbit will be safer. Soon after I am feeding a small flock of ravens. They are glistening black and somewhat larger than a crow. Some of them are quarrelsome, pecking rather savagely at other; and one grabs another and hangs on.",Positive
"I'm going to a party at Laura's house. I'm wearing a costume, half penguin (my bottom half) and my top half was probably a wizard costume (which I do have physically) because in the dream I think I referred to myself as ""the penguin wizard"". A lot of people laughed at my costume (not at me!). Then I am at Plainview High, presumably. I see Ms. L. (old Spanish teacher) and realize she isn't dead (like I thought in a previous dream). Joey and Herman are there and I start speaking Spanish to them. I was asking them things like ""Que' es un parajo? Pues, un parajo es un animal."" Then I said something like, ""Tiene pies muy grandes."" Ok, not all ""parajos"" (birds) have big feet, but maybe I was just talking about penguins. Then I said in English that I don't know how to say ""penguin"" in Spanish and consulted my dream Spanish dictionary. I thought it was very interesting that the Spanish word for penguin, according to my dream, was ""la manera"" which in English translates to ""the way."" This part gets a little weird. I'm in the living room, sitting on the couch and Grandpa is there. I realize it's September, and can't believe the school year has hardly started. Grandpa asks Paul what his name is, and he gives a false name (I don't remember what he said). He spells it out for him with a straight face although he's joking. Then, I remember Eva said she had a crush on Paul (under his other name) and asks me what she should tell him. I said, ""First you can tell him he's a liar because his name's not [insert false name here]."" The next thing I know, I have received a gift. At first I think it's from my aunt and then I see it's from this family that I haven't seen in years and with whom I don't have a great relationship. The title of the ""poster"" was ""Grown-up Cliches"". Then, I see another regular poster, ""Video Games Through the 20th Century,"" where there was a picture of a video game for each year between 1900 and 2000. I knew there were no video games in 1911, but there was still a game shown. In the picture was snow, and a building that looked like it could have been an igloo. I thought maybe the poster was about games about events occurring during those years (WWII in 1940, et cetera).",Negative

Amazingly I give up my time to go over to my client's house to deliver the work to them. I drive one client ( a female) with her child for about half an hour to where her colleague Julian is having a meeting. I give the work to him. It's got something to do with a talent show for tv or something. Julian drives us all back to his house. Only then do I realize that I've left my car back where we came from.

"Two Gangs  There are two gangs. A sign is flashed and one gang takes off for its territory. The other gang has figured out the sign, which occurred on either a license plate or a billboard. The second gang (that figured the sign out) is going to try to beat the first gang to their territory. The territory is a rooftop. I am climbing floors in a building, going to the roof.

"I was at the old house and the neighbours were across the road. I went into the study to see this fat, old, Native woman lying on the pouffe thing. I yelled 'what are you doing here? Get the hell out!' and she waddled out. The window in the lounge room was lifted up and there was no lock. A lady was trying to get in and failed and left. Two guys with uniforms on were at the door. I was suspicious and kept asking them questions. I went to get something and came back to see them trying to get in. I tried to hold the lock down but somehow it got pushed up. I'd grabbed a knife and I threatened them with it. I think I cut one guy and he pulled out a gun and I didn't know what to do.",Negative

"Man Trolling A Torpedo  I'm at a lakeshore. A hilly gravel windy road runs along the lake. I'm with others. A man trolls along the shore of the lake, about 50 feet out from shore. His fishing lure drags really close to the shore: one or two feet. He's using a baby torpedo lure, I see. I ask him if it's a tiny or a baby torpedo, even though I know what it is, just to make conversation. He stops and talks to me, saying it's a baby torpedo. He is trolling for bass. He uses the name ____ (I forget) instead of bass, which is unique. I think there probably aren't many bass in this lake. It's a very clear lake, and the depth drops off from shore really fast with little shallow shoreline for bass. He says that a thunderstorm is supposed to move in shortly, tonight or tomorrow, and after that we're supposed to get clear weather until it cools off this fall. I think that's good news because I want sun when we're in the Big Resort Area. I am in a basement with the man and my friend Hank Anderson. We talk about moving a wall back for more space.

"I was at Grandma's house. Denny Carter and his wife were there. They had two daughters. One was walking and the other one was still small and in a buggy. The walking one went to the buggy and I was afraid it would harm the small one by scratching the eyes for face, but she just looked at it and went on walking. There was a big fly in the house. I got the fly swatter and hit the big fly and knocked it down on the floor. There were a lot of small flies on the floor, so I was swatting them all. We had two trees in the kitchen. My brother Steve said, ""Looks like one of them moved a little to the falling stage."" I looked and sure enough, down it came. Then sometime later the other tree came down also. It hit the window, broke the panes, then when the top of the tree went thru the window as the top hit the ground, it flopped over and landed on the neighbor's driveway. To my surprise, the trees were about 40 ft. high and still they were supposed to be growing in my mother's kitchen and the ceiling is only 9 ft. high. I went outside and looked at the tree. It lay on the neighbor's driveway. I thought of calling the press and have a photographer come and take a picture of it. It was an unusual freak of work.

"This dream consisted of a vast grassy plain on a beautiful warm day. I was simply walking across this field. I just walked and walked. I was content and gay. I have no idea where I was walking to or where I was coming from. The setting of the dream--that is the field--is not familiar to me and I don't think it is any place that I have ever been. Interpretation At this time my life was quite content even though my future was quite uncertain in that I didn't know what I was going to do--in other words--where I was going.

"The day that's supposed to be my going away party, but just listen to the wind outside! The hurricane's going to make my party go flop. But anyway, I had a crazy dream last night. I dreamt that I was in my apartment and I was having some visitors over as an apartment-warming party, and it was really an odd type of a place, and as I was walking around through it, I was feeling like, ""This is not what I had in mind. I had a more normal place in mind."" First of all you had to go up three steps and duck to get in the front door. It was almost like climbing in a window. And there was a couch right in front of it, so it was like a window instead of a front door. And then the bedroom had somebody else's stuffed animals in it, and it had kind of a small and bleah bed, and there was like a shelf mini sound system up on top, like in order to touch it, you had to stand on tippy toes on the bed, but you had a remote control that you could sit somewhere and control it with. And it sounded kind of old and kind of bleah, and you would press a certain button the remote control and it would act as a remote controller for the washing machine. And it had a little laundry chute where you would put the clothes, that was white, right next to the black sound array setup. And you'd put the clothes in and then you would use the sound system remote to control what the clothes have to do in the washing machine. How bizarre! How bizarre! And then Mom wanted to take me down to the cellar to see what the washing machine was doing, and I just did not want to go. I was scared to death to go in the cellar, and that's really all I can remember about that dream. And then I woke up because I thought somebody was knocking on my door, but it was the stupid window banging on the awning. The wind was blowing it around. I dreamt that we were at the park and Mom was playing one of my mixed CD's on her boom box, which it really doesn't sound that good, but it did in my dream, and I was sitting in a banyan tree. And then I came down and we were laying on a blanket and somehow Dad found one of my diary books and happened to open it up to kind of an innocuous passage about being in the park and climbing the tree, and he read it out loud, which I let because I knew there was nothing in that passage. And then he turned the page and he came to something about how hard to get along Aunt Joyce is and I made him close the book. And he was suggesting in my dream that he wanted me to scan these pages so that they wouldn't be on paper any more. ""I don't understand,"" he says, ""a person who doesn't think too much technology in somebody's life, gidgets and gadgets, is a good thing."" But he's got this thing against having stuff on paper. [laugh] I don't know what it is, but in my dream he was wanting me to scan those pages in my diary so they wouldn't be on paper any more. And I told him, ""It doesn't do OCR for handwriting. It probably will ______, there'll probably be an update and then I will, but not now. It doesn't do OCR for handwriting."" Well, he didn't care; he wanted me to. So before I woke up, in my dream I was sitting there trying to do the thing, and I was getting a little tangled up and I wasn't sure where I was going and what I was doing. And then I woke up.",Negative

"I don't recall any clear episode, but there's a series of fragments which I think I can recall in the order in which I dreamed them. In the first fragment I was taking a group of several small boys, their ages probably running from 8 to 10, and probably being between 2 and 5 of them, on a hike. One of the boys is my brother-in-law who is about 10 years old. We were hiking through some mountains which seemed familiar to me in the dream, although I can't place the exact location now. We were hiking above what used to be a creek bed and I was explaining to the boys about how the lower stream bed and valleys had become filled in. I'm not sure what happened on this, whether rains had filled in the valleys with mud or whether some phenomena with glaciers had occurred, but anyway, up to a certain height all the stream beds and valleys were filled in, and I took the boys down this rather narrow little trail to show them this. This little trail had a concrete border along one edge and it was rather steep and I was giving them constant warnings to be careful as they walked along.",Negative

"I was visiting my high school friend Kally and 'Lee' at the university they attend.  It was huge.   The room was open, twice the size of our dorm room.

There were holes in the walls where you could see beyond into the rooms of others, on both sides, boys and girls both.  I was surprised at the lack of privacy and Kally explained that if the whistle was blown, they could swing across back into their room.  After that, I was shopping with my mother, maternal Grandma Jane, and their friend Peggy.  We went store to store. We looked for the apple juice that my boyfriend Jeremy had gotten at the Italian restaurant the other night.  In the last store, we were shopping for my mother's godsons the Swenson triplets, and they came running through.  A guy banged the bathroom stall door into my nose and was mean about it.  I tried to dry my hands and an unmarked videotape came out.  The checker put my hands in some hot air.  We got in the car and Grandma Jane drove.  We were going uphill.  There were floods.  The beach was to our right and lapping up onto the street, and then water started to flow down from above.

"I was in St. Joe with Matthew but at our house - not Mother's house. Matthew and I went for a walk outside. There was alot of snow on the ground. I started off through the woods at one point and Matthew stopped me. He said that was not the path, that if we went that way we would be in danger. I don't know if he said something about bears or if that's just what I thought. As we were walking we saw some children sledding. However, they were sledding down a stream of water. I thought that was a bad idea because I was afraid for their health. I hoped they would go straight home from there and get dry and warm. We saw another woman with children there. Matthew told me that he wanted to go home. Where we were must have been a separate getaway that I owned. He was only the size of about a 12-year-old. However, I asked him if he wanted to go home because he wanted to go up and see Ashley B. He admitted that he did. I was concerned because that would be alot of driving. It's an hour and a half home, then another hour plus to Lafayette and then yet another almost two hours to Ashley B's. I know he has driven that long at once before but I was still concerned. Part of my concern might have been because of the weather and the time of day, or night, that he might be doing the driving.",Negative

"I was on a travel job or something and Frederick was there too. I walked into the hotel room and Frederick was masturbating in bed, but like under the covers and on his knees bent over as if he were on top of someone. He said something like 'good you're here' and motioned for me to get in. I climbed in and took my pants off and he seemed ready to come at any second. He reached down and put like his whole fist inside me and it didn't hurt, but didn't feel good either, it was just weird. He did this for a bit and then went inside me and came. Later, we were somewhere with Cecelia and Emmanuel. I was with Cecelia and heard him telling Emmanuel that we'd had sex. Emmanuel hit something and was clearly annoyed and said something like 'she's a teenager, you don't even know her'. I said to Cecelia 'I'm 25, not 16' and giggled. I also told Mom at some point and I was on my phone on this site and there was a video of it. It was very rough sex and it showed him doing me from behind and then me getting up and wiping myself and throwing the mess away, looking disgusted and in pain.

"I'm on holiday with my partner and our kids. It's a city with deep canals set into a concrete landscape - perhaps like the south bank in London. The water looks fairly clean - like a swimming pool. The canals are wide enough for yacht and large speedboats which shoot past, gleamy white, roughing up the water. A few of us get into the water wearing wetsuits to take pictures of something. It's incredibly dangerous - I almost get run down by a huge yacht that almost squashes me against the side of the canal. I get out of the water and meet a girl who has had more success taking photos in the water than me. She shows me her camera - an ingenious device - that looks like a donut that you hold in one hand, giving you more ability to swim. My partner walks over, suspicious of this stranger. Later we are standing on the walkway beside the canal in a crowd of about 200 people. We are watching Neil Young playing an acoustic set on a raft. Everyone is astonished because this gig seems unplanned, and we feel very lucky to catch it. Later, one of Neil Young's entourage asks me if I could go and buy some more guitar strings for Neil Young. I do, feeling honoured, and I return to give them to him in person on the canal-side. ""Thanks"" he says, looking busy, ""Here's $10. Is that enough?"". ""yep"". Later, one of the entourage asks me if I would give Neil a lift in my small motorboat. Neil Young has morphed into Nick Cave - taller, thinner but just as scary. Nick and his wife climb into my boat, where my partner and my eldest daughter are already sitting. There's not much conversation. The crowd watches as we set off down the canal. Five minutes later we pull over and Nick Cave and his wife climb out. ""Thanks - here..."" He offers me $10.

I had to go up to the top floor, and in reality I am petrified of elevators and so I told them that I would take the stairs and they said, ""You don't want to take the stairs because they're in worse shape than the elevators."" But I decided I would take the stairs and It was some sort of four day work thing. As I climbed the stairs, they started off fine, but as I climbed higher, the stairs became more and more rickety and shaky and wobbly and I was thinking ""Oh my God, what are they going to be like when I get to the real top?"" And then somewhere in all of this I realized that I had to be in Washington DC in two days although the job was supposed to be four days. The couple sort of leaves. My friend who usually drives me to Washington DC came into my dream. I thought ""How do I get down?

As soon as she was finished talking with someone else I introduced myself to her and spoke briefly with her about Marie B. She seemed very cool, aloof, or something - I'm not sure how to describe it.

"I dreamed I was in to see a doctor (a stranger) for consultation. The examination seemed of a trivial nature, but continued for quite some time. I was growing more puzzled by the procedure and wondering why he was taking so long. At last he seemed terribly pleased with himself and told me I had cancer. At the same time indicating because of his skill and early detection of the growth, complete cure was possible.",Positive
"Grandpas, Bob and I went thru a door and there were two bulls Ð a brown one and a white bull. I noticed the bull come at us, so I went back and closed the door. The white bull's head came in the doorway, but I made him pull his head back and I closed the door. I saw big eyes on some kind of a large fowl. I gave Grandpas a rifle and told him to shoot their eyes out.",Negative
"I am supposedly at Ginny and Ernie's house. Five members of a blues band are there temporarily, after a performance. The woman member is serving up a dinner she cooked. I sit at the table choosing to sit next to the handsome dark haired leader of the band. I like this opportunity to practice flirting. He is not particularly interested and moves his place to across the table. A large, coarse featured faced man sits by me. I'm not as interested in him.. The woman serves the meal. I look at it. Caviar and hot-dogs (bunched together like bananas) and fruits like grapes and melon chunks. It looks unappetizing, especially the black Caviar. I tentatively taste the food and am surprised that I enjoy the taste. But the look of the of it, and knowing its fish eggs makes it hard for me to relax and fully enjoy it. The woman wants the group to leave today and go home so she can work on her blues singing. I want them to stay 2 more days they had planned on so I can practice flirting. She asks each one if they want to go. They are ambivalent. She leaves on her own and then comes back in. She's singing a blues song and in the song she pops up in the head and chest part of a mermaid statue singing. I also see the mermaid statues head and chest laying in a cradle like part of another statue.",Negative

Classmate-F-04 from math came in and I laughed and said to leave and then I heard a plop from the poo. Anyway, I got covered in poo somehow and Raquel and I went under this shower and she was naked and a bit fat. People were watching but we just kept jumping around and laughing.",Positive

"I was going to stay over at Astrid's friend's house. There was Astrid and there was another girl that was like Astrid. And first of all, before any of that, I dreamt that I was making kind of a sculpture out of something I broke, and I was using really strong glue. And I put like a dinosaur head on the front of like a porcelain rock, and then I put a little tail on the side of it. I put a couple other things on it, and then this was going to sit on a bicycle. And I think it was really raining and really lightning and thundering and I couldn't really go with the girls to their house until it was done. But they were sitting on the porch swing with me, and Mom came home from a shopping trip and she was unloading groceries in the kitchen. And she was complaining about how the store wouldn't cash her out and she had to wait and wait because if the power goes out at the store, then they can't use their register. What else? I think somehow we got over to the girl's house and Astrid and the girl were going to build something. They had like shop tools out and like saws and sanders and vacuum cleaners. And I think in my dream Astrid had a little bit of vision, about like mine, and the girl had a little bit more than I do. And I was peeking in the dark in the bedroom for a hair clip to tie up my hair and then I woke up.",Negative
"In a dream which I had within a week, the mosaic structure is exceptionally odd. Someone came to me with a book in which I was shown a series of pictures and diagrams in explanation of a strange repulsive game. It was to be played on a bowling alley. But instead of pins, living rabbits and guinea pigs were to be set up. How they could be kept quietly in their places and up on their haunches, I do not know, but this was demanded by the directions. The guinea pigs were to be set at the extreme and far end of the alley, a pair of them, and in front of each, about two feet nearer the bowler, was to be placed a rabbit. The usual massive balls were to be used. Now the object sought by the player with all possible science and skill was to send the balls down the alley, past the rabbits, and curving in beyond them to mash the helpless guinea pigs against the wall. The killing of a rabbit was to be avoided, and was penalized by a deduction from the score for every such accident.",Positive
"The last dream fragment just before waking concerned being in a bookshop with Andre Weitzenhoffer (whom I've never met) trying to buy a copy of his book, General Principles of Hypnotism.

"I am in a snowy field. There is much chaos and confusion. Everything is blurred by thick swirling snow. Refugees are wearing thick clothing to keep warm. I am trying to find the Americans. I go to a woman I recognize. She is a reporter. She is calm. Panicked, I ask her, ""Where are the Americans?"" She points and says, ""By the woman with the child."" I run in the direction she has pointed to. There is no one. The same woman appears. She is sitting at a table. She gives me three letters. They are addressed to me and contain official or important documents. The letters have been opened-searched. I go back to the snowy field. A man and a woman lumber towards me. The man comes up close and suddenly points a long object at me. It appears to be a stick. I hesitate. He shoots. I fall and feel blood flooding my chest. I feel the life force going out of me. I experience the process of dying, which is very ordinary. I am not afraid. Just before death, I wake up.",Negative
"Muskie Fishing  I'm at Smith's Sports store in the Uptown Mall in Oak Valley. They have a muskie fishing package. It includes a big rod or two, a lot of big lures, and maybe some reels.

I know that the bumper sticker wasn't on the bumper earlier, because I looked. Someone must have put the sticker on when I was in the library. I am going to fight the ticket; I should not have to pay. I had nothing to do with the offensive or illegal sticker on my bumper.",Negative

I try and be sympathetic with him. I am interrupted by a woman who works for Lori and Dan T. She asks me to come to the office. I tell Archie to wait and I go into an office room. Lori is there, rather upset with me, and hands me a paper. I feel trapped and don't want to deal with this face to face, but now that I am here, let's get it over with. The paper is a bill for a phone call made by a Mr. Nelson for $48. She wants me to pay it. I hesitate and then get clear. ""No,"" I say, ""I will not pay this bill. It is not my bill. And furthermore I am very unhappy that you billed me for the carpet. I will not pay for that. In fact, I am expecting you to reimburse me my prorated rent and my security deposit."" She becomes very upset and dramatically says to her woman assistant she cannot listen to any more of this. Her face is contorted in over-dramatic nerves. I am aware of Archie waiting for me across the street. I feel compelled to try and get to him, before he gets upset and leaves. I am caught in the middle again. [BL]",Negative
"One of the classic college dreams.  I was living in a dorm, but had stopped attending classes.  I missed my wife Anita and wondered why I was there.  I hadn't even called her in a couple of days, and felt bad about it.  There was another older guy in a nearby room, and we had a conversation about the group who sang some song.  I told him it was the New Christy Minstrels.  Later I was in his room before he returned, with a jug of water on his bed for some reason, and he remembered the name of the group as ""Dead Given.""  When I was preparing to move out, I was shaving in bed, my eyes still droopy from sleeping.  I opened them only as much as necessary to look in the mirror from time to time.",Negative

A phone rings and she tells one of the kids to be sure and answer it. I realize that I will be able to talk to her if she comes in to get the phone. I walk toward the phone in the living room. Lucy comes in,; she is naked. She gets up on the wooden rickety table (the only furniture left) and undoes the lamp fixture in the ceiling. There are lots of cobwebs.

Just a few months ago, you were not going to have him and now you're gone."" [BL]",Negative
I was in Rivertown. I was flying and having a good time. I told someone I was the only person in the world that could fly. Then I said in my sleep. I flew under icicles that were hanging from the school roof and then I dive-bombed at one of my friends. He had a long piece of stiff wire and it got me on time. I got ahold of it and didn't dive at him any more. I was by Grandma's and one of the eaves were higher on one side than the other. I was planning with Steve how to level it and I gave him some suggestions on doing it.,Negative
"I dreamed I was at a beach and then a group of people started to walk on the rocks, and I did too. And we arrived at a beach where one could see the bottom of the ocean. Among the people were my parents. My father went down to the shore and swam, then a boy went down quickly and he got in the water wearing a towel and all and he came out and came up fast. Then I told my father that the tide was rising and it was best to leave, so we started to climb, but in order to go up we had to climb some stairs which were very tall and narrow and they were made of tiles and slippery. I remember that at the beginning I was helping my father and when he reached the top, I was left all alone and couldn't go up, and I asked him for help and he wouldn't help me. When I got to the top some people started to get there who said they were going to play golf and that this was the private beach of a club. I went up and walked to a very small white house that belonged to an aunt of mine. There, in that house, I met two girlfriends who told me that we should go to Ancon. They looked very pretty and when I looked in the mirror, I looked terrible and all my clothes were very dirty and I told them that I couldn't go like that, and they said it didn't matter.",Positive

He was going to produce some object out of it. We waited as the machine went into production, and all at once bicycle tires were coming out of it. He said the tires were $8 apiece. I looked and felt one of the tires, but didn't like them for the price, and it was something new which couldn't be relied on.",Negative
"There is a school, perhaps a college, a man. Now I am the new college president. I am building my own college in the deserts of Central (state), near a small town of hicks, in beautiful landscapes of rust colored mountains covered at the top with clouds and in the shape of a cascade mountain, but no snow; rolling hills. I now inspect the campus starting with my office. It is a very pleasant place with windows and mirrors. I go down long halls where the rooms are on each side that I can't see into. They are still being built and are boarded up. I try to imagine what they will look like. It is too much work for the dream imagination to create the details. I come to a ramped sidewalk thing with side walls that are too skinny and keep squeezing me and I keep trying to force them to be more open and accommodating, and finally succeed. The motto of the school or philosophy is that ""the process is more important than the knowledge."" This is a new way of thinking. I must choose teachers who are open, flexible, honest and creative. Students can goof off, but they are tracked to a goof off track where teachers and counselors work with that energy to transform and ""get it more on a productive track.""

"This is a dream from about a week ago. This is a dream that took place about two weeks ago. It takes place in a drug store, and as I walk into the drug store I recognize a girl at the counter who I went to high school with. Next to her in a small cradle of some sort is a child, very young child. I went over to her and asked her, ""How are you getting along, and to whom are you married? Who is your husband?"" She said something to the extent that, ""Well, I can't have one."" She couldn't have a husband. I then got the impression of two guys who I knew that had been dating her. Someone at this point carried a large rack of cakes past us. They were all rolls, like jelly rolls, but they were slightly bigger. She continued our conversation and said she had remained alright in spite of the situation. I looked at the baby. It was about 1 year old. This situation, meaning that I felt certain that this was an illegitimate child. Thoughts then of making a play for this girl pass through my mind. She looked into my eyes and asked, ""How come you look that way?"" I knew she was referring to the dark rings around my eyes. I said, ""That's because I've just finished studying for a big exam, and I haven't been getting much sleep for about nine days."" Her comment was, ""Well!"" Then I said, ""You should have stayed in school like me and avoided getting involved with anything."" She said, ""Well, we didn't let them get to either one of us anyway."" By this she meant that we really didn't let people get to us anyway and hurt us. The faint impression that she was wrong about herself passed through my mind. For some reason I had to leave and we parted very friendly. I then thought, ""I can really make this girl. Then so could anybody else who wants to. So what's the big deal? She's not that hard to make, and why don't you pick someone who's not so easy to make?"" While in the drug store I had seen several people there - the waitress who was dressed in a white uniform and the policeman who was dressed in a blue uniform and several customers sitting at the counter. As I left the drug store, the setting was identical to a corner drug store in Audubon, N.J. where I lived for many years.  Day residue: Next to a drug store yesterday. I went to a drug store yesterday. I also got a letter from my brother who's wife is ready to have a baby any day now, and she's having trouble carrying the child. One of the girl's teeth in the dream seemed bad. It seemed sort of decayed and this might derive from the telling and retelling yesterday of what struck me as a hilarious Yiddish epithet, translated it is, ""All your teeth should fall out but one, and in that one you should have a toothache.""",Negative

He's furiously writing. I put my head suddenly on the teacher's shoulder and say, ""I guess I'll take a nap."" He likes that I nestle there, but he's agitated because he wants to confess his love and doesn't have confidence. He says something and I look up and we kiss, hesitantly. We smile. The deed is done. We understand that we love each other. Another young man says, ""Maybe you should be working on your writing."" I shrug. The young man reads a sentence from Dennis' work and I realize I had misjudged him. He can write well; I thought he was just a kook. The teacher and I decide to get on this futuristic train-like thing that goes very fast to go get my script and read it closely to see if I need to rewrite.

Mother was in the line standing next to me. She said, There's two lines. I said, no, there is only one line and that woman cut us off, and pointed to her. Mother let us get back in line ahead of her. The next thing I knew, Ola S was in line in front of me. She was very short. less than 4 feet. She was carrying on like she always does. When it was her turn she couldn't see over the counter. I took the paper that the clerk was trying to hand to her and gave it to her. When it was my turn, I asked how long it would take. She said she could resize the ring as soon as she took care of all the people in line. I was very reluctant to let her keep the ring. I told her that the ring is very valuable. The line was so long that I didn't think she would get to it before the store closed so I decided not to leave it with her. I thought I should probably take it to a jewelry store anyway. After I got out of line I decided to go look at rugs. They didn't have the right color for the upstairs bathroom. All they had was a rose color. I thought about how that would look.

"It was out in the street somewhere, kind of ill-defined, but in the street I was watching. There were 2 Negro boys playing football, passing a football back and forth. One was, I had never seen any of these before either in the dream or in real life. One was short, about 16, the other was tall and thin, perhaps about 18. First they were just passing it back and forth and then they would run out for a pass and the other would throw it. Then two other boys came, Negroes also, and began calling for passes and they would catch them. So I was just watching and one pass was just a little too high for the short boy so I kind of ran after it. It bounded in front of me and I caught the ball. So then one of the boys said to me, ""Hey, you can't play."" So I said, ""Why not?"" I didn't pay much attention to them and I was going to throw the ball back to one of the guys and I didn't really have the strength to throw it far. I could feel even before I let it go that I wasn't going to have much strength in it. It only went about half-way, three quarters to the guy and then I woke up. I guess it was present time. Nothing bizarre, unusual at all and the only connection I can make is that I drive thru Coconut Grove everyday thru the Negro section, but otherwise no specific connection.",Negative
"The setting was filled with small airplanes manned by various people including myself, and they seem to buzz around more than anything else, coming in out of the picture or the scene.

One may be flying somewhere in the back or at a higher elevation. I'm in the other two and therefore cannot be seen. However, most of the time it seemed to be my airplane that was being followed. I have a feeling at times of being examined and it seemed as if the examiner was visible, but it's possible that he wasn't. It was no one I recognized. I may be just assuming that there are other people in this dream. It's possible the planes are flying of their own accord. However, I believe there was someone in them.",Positive

I feel good that I can say that directly, but I sit there as he tenderly and needily strokes my face with his arm. I fall asleep. A man (Georgette Heyer hero) comes by and wakes me up. I think, ""Ah! Finally! I'm halfway through the book and haven't met a man I like yet."" This doctor is it. He takes me from the room to help preserve my reputation. He protects my reputation by lying to people.

Ezra ran down the steps and the guy shot and Ezra and Dad said ""FBI! Freeze!"" and shot the guy. We all hurried into the car. Then this other person was having a party and all these famous people showed up. There was this girl (a celebrity) who got romantically involved with this stupid guy. Her ex (another celebrity) was angry and got evil. Then, or before that, we were at home. An old friend of mine except I didn't really know her was there. We went out to get something from this place out in nowhere. There was this evil lady who nobody liked. Something happened and we ended up surrounded by clouds.

"I was asking someone to do the remodel at the store. I was worried that if the committee followed my advice and went with the lowest quote that they wouldn't work out. It turned out to include Cliff S and Don St. I kept reassuring the committee that it was going to be great because I know these men. I told the men that my job and reputation were riding on this and the work had to be good. I kept remembering when Cliff S and I had a crush on each other in the eighth grade. The building they were remodeling was now a church. We started the work without approval. When the committee came by, they thought it looked great. The carpet went clear up the walls in some places.

"I did research on a board game and played it myself to understand it. It involves movie stars. I now am sharing the game with a group of friends: Hillary of Merton Circle, Bob M of Counseling and two other women. I look up to the ceiling and see four large glass or ceramic things we'd somehow secured up there. One is a large cat ceramic (like the one on my fireplace). Another is a dog one, like a cookie jar. One is a huge red glass bowl with ornate embossed patterns on it, very Victorian and beautiful. I notice it's crooked and may fall. I am concerned because we are seated right under it. In the game, there is a MaMa card and a Doctor card. There are four categories to choose from. One is a picture of a young girl (7-8 years old) fleeing from a woman, perhaps in Indian (eastern) dress or early 1900's dress. The theme is the girl was hurt very badly by her mother. I don't remember the other three categories. I see Ginger Rogers seated near the board. She is one of the women in the group, and I say, ""You were my mother in a movie. I'm not surprised you don't remember, I had forgotten too."" Now I'm having trouble remembering how to play the game and it is getting boring. I fold it up like an accordion credit card holder, wondering why I thought it was such a good game. [BL]",Negative
I was at a meeting or conference. Someone was making a presentation about the Maori Drawing. I had an Aha of a way to make my use of this drawing better with dreamwork. I left quickly and went to get my files or something so I could make notes of my idea.

I think I'll see if I can talk to Kendall B by phone and discuss an idea about this with him. Maybe I'll just wait until conference.,Positive

The school was different and we were set up in the 'office', which was next to the canteen. I remembered it was school holidays and there wouldn't be any students. Esther and everyone else disappeared and I was wandering around waiting.

In the dream he has all sorts of trailers parked outside, and strange large bits of metal (perhaps they are cement mixers that fold up). I see him as I'm trying to park. He is parking another large lump of metal. We engage in small talk. I am a bit annoyed with his taking up all the parking space, but I try to remain polite. He doesn't seem to get it, and just chats away.",Negative
"Dreamt about my dad again. In this dream we were having a big argument. I think I told you that in reality my mother has Alzheimer's disease, she was just recently diagnosed, there have been a lot of problems with her short term memory and forgetting things, leaving doors open instead of locking them and things like that. In this dream I had a big argument with my father and I said ""How can you leave me with this?!"" I was so mad because I thought that he had left me to deal with this and he said ""I guess you'll just have to deal with it the best you can!"" And that's what he would have said. Basically the sense I used in this dream was hearing, we were shouting, we were arguing back and forth with each other. I don't exactly know where we were. We were standing in a room facing each other and yelling at each other, so I could feel myself standing like I normally can. It wasn't a very pleasant dream but it had a sense of reality to it.",Negative
"I was in a museum. I was looking at a computer, typing something up about this museum, like a description. I was describing this one room that was about this one guy. There was something about his own music. I was retyping it to say that this organ was playing this man's music.",Positive
"I was watching 90210, and one girl was mad at the other and she was sending vicious notes to the other. Then all of a sudden I was in this room and there was this huge open door leading into an eating room, like a summer camp type eating room. In the room I was in there were letters on the wall like the ones on 90210, which was strange. Anyway, I got into the eating room and I see P. At the same time we both made that signal with our index fingers to come to each other and mouthed the words, ""yeah, we're not shy."" Then we walked towards each other. My mom then woke me up. Setting: Two rooms, one like a camp eating room, the other a plain old carpeted room. Characters: Shannen Doherty, Tori Spelling from 90210 (big brats), and P., who I luv, but we're usually both shy around each other. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, relaxed. It was a nice dream, very joyable. Every dream I have with P. just makes me happy...and usually we're shy around each other and we weren't which was good!!",Negative

"A former patient on the ward named Romanolo was seated by me. I was standing. He was complimenting me about something I had done.

His constant concern about my welfare also annoyed me. When I showed annoyance, he insulted and derided me.)",Negative

"Mary and I are in what appears to be a dining room with other people. These other people seem to be family and friends. We are either in our own home, or in someone else's home, entertaining or being entertained. Mary is in a fun-loving and playful mood and is able to convey to me that she's interested in having sex -- like right now! I go along with her mood, but question how we can have sex now when we are in the company of others. She laughs and suggests that I try and find out -- and leads me out of the room and into a hallway where there are no people. Then she comes to me, we embrace and kiss. It is a long, passionate kiss. I think she reaches for my penis, but I can't get an erection. I say we can't have a ""quickie"" if I'm not able to get an erection. She laughs and suggests we try again, later on. Then I realize my lips are covered with Mary's lipstick, so I find a washroom where I wash it off. I'm eager to have sex with Mary as soon as possible, but am worried that I may not be able to get an erection. I wonder if the long period that has elapsed during which I've not had sex with Mary may cause this problem.",Negative
"I'm in a kind of theater watching a sort of improvisational group (all young, eager-to-break-out types) do a variety of, shall we say, experimental pieces. None of them are anything to write home about, and one bit is just plain bad - a girl is doing a dance that might have been meant for ballet, but mostly consists of her moving from place to place and posing. At one point the audience is expected to participate - we get up and sort of march around. (This theater is more like a gym with bleachers in it, only one side, but I do think it's not really.) We go up and then around a bit - this one woman and I (she's older than me, rather housewifely, short middle-class hair, decade-off clothes with a scarf) march all the way around to the front again and by that time they've started doing something else, and we sort of hesitate for a second to walk in front of the other people, but we do anyway - it's not as if we're disturbing anybody. Another time there's a sort of intermission, and some of us go outside. There's a little shop nearby [where I see or find something that I react to - either something I've been wanting, or something I'm surprised at, or something I've got one of and I'm pleased to see another. Don't remember].",Negative

"I went to Kerhonksen in the mountains during the off season. Dora was with me when nobody else was there and disappeared when any other people came. Kitty was there with us. We made a movie of her (the cat) walking slowly. She was happy. She was drinking water from a fire hydrant. When kitty wasn't there anymore we projected her big on the wall and she seemed to walk even slower. About this time, people drove in for a wedding. I was a little--A LOT surprised that John Harrelson was getting married to a woman. John was gay and the girl was not. The sandwich was hung from the table on a fishing line, and if somebody started to snack, it was pulled away. The bride's brother had spilled pills all over the place. I helped them find them. My mother met the girl's mother. After I introduced my mother to the bride's mother, My mother leaned slightly over the food. I heard my mother say, leaning over the food (for the wedding) ""She comes from JUNK"" I said, ""mother, that won't get things off on the right foot."" People I used to know. I hadn't typed since high school. A bus driver was going up the elevator and trying to eat a sandwich at the same time. (he dropped it and it went into the escalator and he fell and was laying on the escalator as it went up, still reaching for the sandwich, and the escalator was going to chew him up. He couldn't get up. There was nothing I could do.) I knew where the new testament ??? Same as home ??? State park and national forest was in S.C. and they kissed. People I used to know asked for actions then tranquilizers and promises of lunch. I said, ""You'll try to lure me."" I was thinking about that I didn't. ""I would care if...if...

"Melanie is with me, looking at my crowded bedroom area - it's in a place that's not all mine - other people live here, but it's not just a house - more like the open-office arrangements. My area is stuffed full of things, and there's only 1 electrical outlet. I've just brought in a new lamp and rearranged the extension cord arrangement, which is wonky. I go somewhere for a bit, or turn my back, and Melanie rearranges it again so it's clumsy and obtrusive, so I have to put it back. She's noticing things I have since she last saw, especially 2 tennis rackets. I'd got them on sale somewhere familiar (as in close proximity, like the Library Store), and I hate to pass up a real bargain even if I have no immediate use for it.",Negative

It is 12:40 p.m. and I realize I forgot my computer glasses at the cafe so I walk back. On the way I meet some girl who is upset because her mother wants her to act like she is 11 years old when someone comes to see them about buying a house. She doesn't want to do this.

"Was in a store with my friends Jenna and Emma, and we tried on some silly hats.  One was a banana slug, and two were butterflies.  We looked and saw that they were supposedly $20 each.  We looked and saw the price wasn't for the hats, but the Cheez-Its sitting next to them.  We couldn't understand.  There was a clerk not too far away.  We opened one of the boxes and there was a broken bean with seasoning powder in it.  Then the aisle became more like a street.  There were a lot of clone girls dressed in a grey skirt and black top.

"(01/05/98)[""Rape and Kill.""]  I am in my bedroom. I get up and go into the bathroom. Carlos comes in with the intent to rape me. He grabs me and I struggle. I shove him away and escape into the living room. He now has a gun. I call 911. I can barely see and my movements are slow motion. I try to remember my address. I finally remember 2nd and Elm. It's like my memory is going. Then I remember 2127. Carlos is approaching and I start to duck and hide in the computer room. There is a blue mat standing on its side. I hide behind that. Carlos is near. I grab the gun. He wounds me. I now have the gun and Carlos is lying on the ground. And still trying to hurt me. I finally shoot him in the shoulder. Now I feel angry and righteous. I have the right to kill him. I feel some restraint of compassion but it is small compared to the desire to kill him. I shoot him three more times in unvital areas. Finally, the police arrive, but it now looks like I am the aggressor and they want to arrest me. Carlos grins and tells them I tried to seduce him and then attacked him. I am furious.",Negative
"I take the wrong bus to go to a dance and to meet women and decide to go instead to a movie. There is a new film on the Korean War. At the last moment I decline the movie, which is very crowded outside, and begin to walk. I am near a police station. Off in the distance I see a riot taking place. A group of people have broken several one and two story windows and are looting merchandise. I say nothing. The police finally take notice and storm the building. I am now with other people watching what is taking place. The rioters jump onto an electric building scaffold and zoom up to the top of the building, maybe ten stories. The police follow and enter the building. Immediately, one girl jumps from the top story. We watch as she plummets down. I turn away at the last moment as she hits the pavement. When I look back, her head, likely split open, is covered by a sheet. A woman next to her is wailing. The body moves. She is still alive. She is moaning. I go inside the building with someone else. We believe the others have jumped from one rooftop to another, making good their escape. We are in the basement. There are huge empty rooms. We go up one or two flights. The rooms upstairs are also empty; made of wood, they are old and rotten. A black man, an authority of some kind, sees us. We run. He confronts us later. Recollection ends here.",Negative

The show was cool. The Hitler guy from Dracula's was in it. I had a shower and then I found out that a taxi was going to pick us up to go to a restaurant. I didn't want to go because my hair was messy. I tried to straighten it, but it was wet.",Negative

"I was standing right inside the window of one room and Bill C was standing inside the window of another room. The room that he was in was a bathroom. He had just gotten out of the shower so he didn't have any clothes on. He looked different than in waking life. He was much heavier and even in the face didn't look the same. We saw each other standing inside the window so he called out of the window from the room he was in and through the window of the room where I was. But then we saw in a distance that Jane C was there. So we got concerned and he quickly went back. Tried to quickly get back without her seeing us. I guess maybe she was headed towards us. She didn't catch us. The place where we lived was my home now in waking life. I had come home and the front door was open. But it looked like something was going on next door also. I wondered if they were getting it ready for someone new to move in. It looked like they had put black blinds on the windows. I noticed those and thought how nice they looked. But my front door was standing open. I hesitated at the door trying to decide whether to go in or not. I realized that it was the maintenance men that were in there. They had brought in a lot of equipment. You can hardly even get into the kitchen. At some point I wondered if I was finally getting my new windows but I don't think that's what they were doing. There were a lot more than the 3 or 4 maintenance men that work here in waking life. Tim U is the only one I recall from waking life. Maybe the other men were subcontractors. As soon as they saw me they realized that they had forgotten to put plastic down on the carpet before they started coming in and out and working there. As a result there were black footprints all over the carpet. They quickly started putting something down on the carpet. They put some of it down on top of the black footprints. Now Jane C either came in or was there and I just noticed her. She was using a vacuum and cleaning up the black stuff on the carpet. We were trying to figure out how to get rid of these clones of us. We decided that we needed to use a time machine and travel back in time. We realized that the three of us needed to travel together. Myself and whoever I was married to and our daughter. We would go back to a period in time that we had visited previously and created this clone, we went back to that period of time. We would find them and not tell them why we were there. I don't know that they even realized that we were clones or that we were from a different time or anything. We had to come up with a reason to get all three of them in the same room and standing next to each and very close to us. As soon as we did that something happened that took a second and they just disappeared. Whatever we did took a split second and they disappeared. It seemed that there were a lot of different ones all in one time period. It was almost as though we realized that all of the clones existed in one time period and we realized that we could get rid of all of them at once if we could get them all in the same room at one time. So we had done this but we also realized this time that some of the clones looked very different. Like the teenage daughter in one of these clone families looked like a very old woman and she was maybe only 3 feet tall. She had shoulder length, full, grey hair. In the face looked like an old woman. The way she walked and carried herself was very much like an old woman. She is the only one that I remember specifics about the differences in appearance. It was at that point, where we had gotten them all in the room together, and we started making them disappear one family at a time. We were doing quickly enough that it didn't cause a problem.",Negative
"I was at the Royal Show. The first thing we saw was a ""Pat-the-Penguin"". It was a kangaroo in a penguin suit and we thought it was a penguin at first and then it was a person inside and we realized. I went to go into a separate part of the Royal Show. They said I had to be 15+ to go in by myself. But Mom came and I got in. It had all the waterslides and stuff. We left that bit and I went back and I was allowed in. I went into this toy shop and a lady from before said no people under 15 were allowed in. And she read out something about ""no smelly girls or boys under 15"". And I said I am 15. She said ""Oh. When's your birthday?"" and I said ""25 January 1990"". Then she asked me what term I was in. But I didn't get it at first. Then she asked when Baby Day was. I was like ""How should I know?"" Then I said today, because I had seen a poster with a mother and a baby. I was right. I was then backstage somewhere. I was there with some people from school. Also people were building a building over the water and Mom and I almost fell. Jocelyn and I were also walking around somewhere near the penguin thing.

There was a documentary on the TV about a dangerous monkey thing. It showed it eating and drinking at some water. A crocodile came and it bit it and then let go and then the crocodile left.

I don't think it's a bedroom that I'm in but there is a full or double bed. There is stuff piled up everywhere. I can hardly walk. I'm thinking about where people are going to sleep. At first I'm not sure how many people there are. For some reason I think that this is going to be fine, that there's enough room for everyone. I'm thinking there's only two of us besides BJ. BJ comes in and we're talking about where people are going to sleep. She said something to me about everyone needing to sleep in that one room. I don't think there's any way that we can do that. I think that's when I realize there are ten or eleven people. I think there is one other person in the room now too. Maybe Bev. I'm just thinking there is no way we can all sleep in this one room. There's stuff everywhere so there's not even room on the floor. Then someone says something about Carter (from the TV program Trading Spaces) being one of the people. I said, Oh. Well. If Carter is one of them we can have three people in that one bed and he just has to sleep in the middle. I'm, of course, one of the people sleeping in the bed.

One lot I got was '14'. Then you did something with them but I don't remember. I discovered Dmitri played it and left like 10 messages. He joked about it later.

And we were arranging this buffet on our dining table, and I had given them two little Styrofoam balls and they crafted one to look like a pond and they put water in it, and they crafted another to look like a fountain. And they made this house out of cardboard with like a big roof and like white in the front, and they like made it sort of longer than higher, and that was kind of a backdrop of the buffet. And I think I climbed up on the chair at the side of the table, and I grabbed the jug of water and I poured myself a glass. And then I sort of went along down through the buffet and I got through these things. And I can't remember what the significance of all this was.

"Something about my dissertation. Susan J and Dorothea D were both in my spiritual direction class. I had copied an article for them that I had asked them to read related to my dissertation.

I also told them both that if they had changed their mind or do change their mind about being on my committee because of time I certainly would understand. But it seems that maybe each of them were working on their PhD as well. We were talking about all of the technical editing. I said to them that I didn't think they should make themselves crazy about the technical editing of the proposal since we were required to hire a technical editor anyway at $25 an hour.

At some point she hands me a green can of Mountain Dew, with her hand completely covering the label of the can. I take it, and see it is a Mountain Dew. I don't say anything, but know that for some reason she doesn't want me to have a beer. I see Melanie with her uncle. The child, who I presume is Melanie, is a young boy, about 10 years old. They are in a jeep. The uncle is driving. There seems to be an assault or conflict, which may be sexual.",Positive
"Mom, Ezra and I were in the car and had to pull up on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere and it was night. There was a car in front of us. Then there was another car crossing the road. I saw the licence plate was 8ZE-963 and I realized it was Eugene's car. It turned out his father Abraham was in it and his name was like Meluson and he was dead? I'm not sure what happened but we were then walking. I had no shoes, only those socks I have with the little doopy things underneath. It was day and the ground was hot. Then we were using rollerblades and were going really fast down the road. We went into a shop and were getting chocolates. I got a Lite Mars Bar. I heard two people talking about a robbery, and I realized they thought we were going to steal. Ezra said ""figures"", referencing the fact that we weren't dressed in expensive clothes in this posh area. We went to the checkout and left. There was a cat outside that kept hissing at everyone. There was a girl and two days after her birthday something had happened. The lid on my water bottle was gross and I was going to take a lid off of someone else's that was on a table outside, but I then realized that was disgusting. There was a forest across the road. Police and other people were scattered around. There were a lot of cop cars. I went over and then they all came back to one place. Then some others and I were running through it and everyone chased us. I climbed up a tree and the people walked past looking for us. I got down and started running again. Then Eugene was with us and he was my boyfriend, I think. He told me to keep running one way, across the road, and then there was more forest which was thicker. I kept running and I got separated from him. After running through some forest on the other side, there was a field and then there was a hill a while away with some woody forest path. Then there was a UFO and it got too close and caught on the power lines and crashed into the ground. I yelled at everyone to run back and it exploded. Then it was like a Government tape I was watching and had end of Cloverfield like writing on it. I turned it off. Then it was a movie and for the sequel they wanted me to return, though I was supposed to have died. Eugene had survived and was upset about me having died. In the first movie, at the beginning there was a jetty with boats in the water. I can't read the next bit [something about countries], but it then says that the land wasn't ok to live on. There weren't many in the first one but in the sequel there were more of them. There was a female president, or at least, I assumed she was the president.",Negative
"I was driving around a small town in a Cadillac and stopping at a small store where they sell just ties. I was driving the car and my mother was in the passenger seat.

"Checkpoint  I'm at the Uptown shopping mall and I buy a big brown short-sleeved shirt with some strips on it. I go out the JC Penny back doors. I ride in a car with a family. There is a lady driving with an infant on her lap. Two girls are in the back with me. A boy is in the front passenger side. We go by the liquor store. The baby kisses its mother, using its tongue. The mother kisses back, with tongue. At the corner of Main Street and Oak Avenue we are stopped. On the corner there where Nantucket's furniture store is there is a checkpoint. They are checking for a disease or a problem. I know I have been to this place before in a previous dream. They take my photograph while telling me to look at a small black plastic card with some numbers on it. I am sitting across from a woman who has blue hair. Her hair is short, and in a messy, dreadlock-type look, all bunched up in places, pinched together. She has fishhooks all over her head and in her ears. They are stuck in her hair. I think of telling her that once I pierce my ears with fishhooks, but I don't. The workers there want to turn on a television. The radio is already playing. They give me an identification card. It's black and white and fuzzy. The photo on the card isn't me. The name on the card isn't mine. There is a sort of code on the back, like a UPC code, I think that is where the cardholder information is.",Negative
"I was downtown with my friend Deanna and her boyfriend Calvin, riding my bike, at night.  We stopped at a store, and I was taking a long time to try and lock up my bike.  Finally I gave up and went in and was looking at the rodents.  When we left the store we went back to the apartment- Deanna and I were roommates.  I talked them into coming to the observatory with me.  I had to go to a meeting for the observatory- a bunch of us were going to go up as a group.  The sky was grey and we were sitting on a ledge to a grassy area outside a museum, I believe.  I was talking to a woman about when she was scheduled to work, and I mentioned how nice it was to only work in 1 or 2 hour shifts instead of for the full night.  Finally we got up to the observatory and someone showed us all to our rooms.",Negative

I walk into the bedroom and see two king sized beds, 2 pianos. 2 stereos. A woman comes in, my roommate. She and I are unpacking our things. I try to play on the piano. I want to take lessons to improve my skills. She suggests we share our things with each other. She writes some down on a paper.

"I remember some faint bits and pieces of a dream I had last night. There was supposed to be more of the story, but I only remember part of it. Apparently I didn't do something right or something; things weren't going right. And it was back to treating me like a kid. Mom was saying how she's going to start taking some of my stuff away -- not my equipment, but like kid stuff, like my dolls and stuff, like if I was a kid. And I remember hiding a few of my best ones deep within the junk pile of my closet. And then I took a big kind of thick base and I held it above her floor in her room where she had a whole bunch of stuff scattered around, and I said, ""If you keep up this process, I'm going to break this vase in here and you're not going to have a vase and you're going to have a big bunch of glass to clean up."" So after that she sort of abandoned the process and just sort of went back to sorting junk. And that's all I can remember.",Negative

"Dora and I had pushed our bicycles up onto the roof of a house. Dora took her bicycle up via the tree and I went up the least slanted rooftops. We met at the top. We were in different places. I could not see Dora. I walked across one roof and looked while Linda and Marianna had been working. Linda's newest store was on Lafayette. The entrance on Crosby. Marianna had been cutting out wooden dolls with a chainsaw. Linda was getting a show ready. Lots of little dolls and stories and photos she'd cut up for the stories. About the people not having money for a place to stay--so one person checked into the mental hospital and everybody slept in/under the bed with him. There was a picture of the guy in bed with a blanket and so many other faces cut out and put in there with him. There was a break with a fashion show of Linda's dolls. Soho-ish ladies were there. One had on a lightly sequined pale green dress with buttons and labels across the back. 4 labels on back, one on front. ""Medicaid"" one said. She was a high-class society lady trying to look hip. Linda had a sister named Lee--who used to be a crack head and lived in the park. Now she was a skydiver and adventure enthusiast. There were dolls to paint. One person said, ""This should be relaxing,"" and I said, ""You have to concentrate like if your ears are real dirty and you're trying to clean them out and you just can't get them cleaned out."" ""A good analogy,"" Linda said. I was painting in the girl. ??? Dora. He said his Dad was killed by a drunk driver and I told him about ??? Marianna had found my old invites. They did not invite me.

"My Ballerina  I'm on a street that I know to be Gerald Avenue in Woodland, though in waking it is in a different vicinity, southwest of Brimson. I skip down the sidewalk going north. I take long strides, going fast, and seeing how much of the road I can leap over while I skip. I leap, and soar over the entire street. I cross Old Avenue, and am on Fish Street, coming from Brimson. I leap into the air, jumping ten feet or more, floating lightly, spinning, and twisting before landing softly and leaping again. On the northeast corner of Old Avenue and Fish Street is an old brick house. While I leap I land on the lawn of this house, on a small but steep hill that is in the front yard. A young girl rides by on a bicycle. She says something to me indicating that she's mad that I jumped on her grass; she lives in the brick house. She rides her bicycle around the back of the house to tell someone what I'm doing. I feel somewhat guilty, but not really, and I keep on leaping and twisting lightly as I make my way northward down Fish Street. I hope the people aren't so picky as to reprimand me for leaping on their grass.",Negative
"I am in a strange sort of bunker. The other day I had been going through an album of family pictures. The bunker is actually the bar in the basement of 39 Ivy Street! I am lying on the counter in a prone position; the atmosphere is one of war. Sandbags and timber abound. The sky is eerily overcast. Bombs begin to fall. Not the mortars of past dreams but rather some kind of heavy artillery. A sharp thunder follows the initial detonation, as if there were some sort of dual explosive, or perhaps a new barrage tactic. I throw myself over and fall to the ground. Cowering under the counter I wait for the inevitable. Within seconds a shell crashes down upon the spot I had occupied and not too hastily vacated. Debris flies; dirt clods and splinters of broken wood shower down. I recall the thought of being randomly lucky. The dream becomes unclear at this point.",Negative

The sympathetic landlord agrees to send up food until it is safe to come out. I go in the room, but there are many doors that keep opening and I am busy going around and locking doors and putting furniture up against them. There is another room and I need all this sealed off, and so I keep trying to remodel the room with my thoughts and see it small and only one door, which I can lean the bed up against.

"I was working at my computer. I'm not sure if I was at the CAS office or at home or if I was doing CAS work, schoolwork, or something else. The impression that I have right now is that I had a number of Excel spreadsheets that had lists of things that I can best describe as characteristics or issues. For example, if I were writing something I might want to make a bulleted list of factors, characteristics, issues, etc that apply to or help to describe what I am writing about. It was information that anyone could use - not necessarily related to business or profession. There were then also separate, singular words that I can't even decide if they were written down somewhere, if I was viewing them on the computer or if they were just in my mind. There were two separate sources of the lists and of the singular words respectively. I was seeing the mental connection between the two, how one word was a perfect fit for one list, another word a perfect fit for another list and so on. So, for example, the list associated with communication were things that would help people to understand more about communication and could help them become much more effective communicators. They definitely felt like insights that would be knew to most people - not written about before. The more connections I made the more excited I became. Also, it felt almost like one of those things that I classify as things that you don't know that you know - it's as though seeing it or hearing it brings it to the conscious mind. I was sitting there saying, Yes. Exactly. Of course. I knew this was very meaningful and going to be extremely useful to a lot of people. I was eager to share it with Bill C because I knew he would get it and really appreciate it.",Positive

I didn't see anything that I felt was cause for concern so I signed it. Just as I did they passed another set of papers around, saying that there was an error in the first set. In the meantime, I was listening to some other people discuss the proposal and was now not sure that I wanted to sign. I was somewhat surprised to see Aaron S there.

I recalled that the restrooms at the end of the building were not used at that time. We went that way. We passed a locker room. I looked inside, but there were people in there. The woman and I became separated. Then I met my mother. She thought I was planning to steal something. I told her I was not, but I did not tell her about the woman I was looking for. Later I saw a woman who resembled her, but then I saw that it was someone else. She was light complected, her body was healthy looking and she was very friendly.",Negative
"I dreamed that my younger sister was dead; that is, that she had been murdered. She was in the room, on the floor, covered with blood. I went to the living room and found a man of black race, half naked, and with a knife in his hand. I had never seen him before. I was very scared. I thought perhaps he would kill me too.",Negative
"Some weeks ago I fell asleep and found myself standing near the autoclave in the laboratory talking with a young woman. After a little she excused herself and went down to the east end of the room. In a minute she came back with an irregular block of glittering ice set upon her shoulders in place of her head. She stood before me, naturally without speaking. I watched her with anxious interest. The ice began to melt and trickle down. Channels formed in the mass, its angles were rounded away; the sculpturing went on rapidly. I saw that it was taking on a definite shape, and in a moment more, it was a beautifully molded head of a horse; eyes, ears, and nostrils were faithfully carved out in the clearest ice.",Negative
Some kid was acting odd and I think he was sexually abused. This other kid was acting similar. I was talking to their father with some people. I think he was a doctor. We bashed him? The police were called and the place got set on fire. They got out us out.,Positive
"I went to a restaurant that had a billiard room in it to meet one of my boyfriend's friends from his soccer team. This restaurant was a place that my boyfriend was working at in the dream. My boyfriend saw me and asked what I was doing there, and I said that I was here to meet his friend to play pool. My boyfriend told me to wait a minute and he would join us because he was just getting finished with work. I said OK, but I felt disappointed because I wanted to do something by myself. I was always waiting for him to be free to go out and at that moment I wanted him to wait for me.",Negative
"Frog Catching  I'm driving my mom's station wagon with Ramona. It's dark out, and I'm out of control: swerving and going on the shoulder of the road. I unbuckle my seat belt and sit kneeling on my legs. I steer by pressing keys on a piano. Both my hands are in C-position. If I press the G's I go to the right. If I press the C's I go to the left. I can't find home position and have to keep looking down at the keyboard, taking my eyes off the road. Ramona knows I'm out of control.  We're driving to the Metropolis to meet my dad. It's dark out and there are frogs on the road. They hop across as I drive. I stop the car and start catching frogs. We put them in the small green Duck Tales tackle box. I get five frogs and say to Ramona only five more then we'll go. It is morning then and I've pulled into a driveway. The sun is shining and we try to catch these huge frogs. We're really late going to the Metropolis.",Negative
"I'm with a bunch of people somewhere out of the country, maybe England, I figure we're doing a LT, and we're staying in this place that's old and large, with lots of rooms. We've sort of bunked where we could, girls here, boys there, and most of our luggage (or at least where my clothes are) is in this big long room rather like an attic, with various wood roof supports, trunks, hanging-racks, old furniture, the odd cobweb, dust. My friend and I are going back here to collect our stuff so we can pack, it's time to go home, and I'm filled with thoughts about travelling, planes and such. As I'm picking things up I realize that they're pretty scattered around, as if in our coming and going we'd been pretty casual, hanging things here and there, setting things down in different places, and I'll have to collect them. But somehow the racks and things look emptier than I expected, and now others of us are coming in, bustling around. They're not packing up right now, just my girlfriend and I, and frankly they're in the way, particularly the guys. I'm moving from place to place looking and I have to keep dodging people. Now I come to the conclusion the stuff is just not here. How can that be? I'm quite confused.",Negative

"(07/15/97)[""Showering with the girls.""] I see my dream mother who is very tired. She has been working very hard. I say come on into my room and lie down and rest. She does. I walk with her and after she is lying down, I decide to change my clothes. I go to the closet and see lots of hangers laying down in a row blocking my way to the clothes. I manage to reach through and get a dress, my purple sleeveless jumper. I am looking for a blouse too. I realize most of these clothes I'd gotten at Good will and didn't recognize them Most are too small for me to fit into. I am interrupted and I decide to walk across the long hall and change in the other bedroom, the one belonging to other siblings. I decide I need a shower and take my clothes off. I notice that along one wall of this outer bedroom are shower heads or sprinklers and water is pouring down the wall. It does not occur to me that that is the shower. Instead, I open a metal door and step in to a very long and narrow metal shower stall, where three or four other women, in colorful bikini's are already in there. I am surprised and a bit embarrassed by my nakedness. One woman says to me this is a class. Oh, I say. The shower water turns on and I get my hair wet. Just as I hear a click that I suspect will be the shut off of the water, I suddenly decide to shampoo my hair and sure enough with my hair all lathered up, the water stops. The other women are not sympathetic.",Negative

I am standing at the front of the stairs, repeatedly working the light switch up and down, trying to get the light to go on (it already is on, but I keep trying to turn it on), but nothing happens. The doorbell rings, and my youngest brother is at the door. I am quite annoyed with him, because we had him started to school in plenty of time to get there on time and by coming home again, he will be late, and also because he has taken his coat off against orders. He says something about being hungry and I decide that he has forgotten to eat breakfast.",Negative
I heard an announcement on radio Daily Double 5Ñ6. I was looking at a clock and it would stop and then go again and then later I saw a brush stuck up there and the clock had the wrong time. I was under some trees. They started to fall. I was dodging them as they fell down.,Negative

"Washing Machine Torture  My friend Kevin Simpson or my housemate Jack Thigpen drives me home to Oak Valley. He pulls up on the stretch of boulevard that lies between my neighbors the Robbins' and the Christianson's houses, on Next Ave. We are returning from the Big Resort Area. We're on the grass of what seems to be somewhere near by, maybe the Otis' house on the southeast corner of 2nd Street and Next Avenue. We're packing up our stuff: a pack and a tent or tarp. We do this packing secretly. A police car is coming. We hurry with our packing. As the male police officer pulls up we are putting our stuff in a bag. He asks us some questions, and we respond. He doesn't have any idea what we are doing. He has blue tarp. There is a game of throwing marbles or tiny balls at a pillar or target circle. The officer wants to try this. I've been good at this in the past, but I throw once and miss by a lot. I'm in recreation room. My sister Ramona is throwing a marble at a square support pillar in the room. The marble bounces back to her. She does this repeatedly. It doesn't appear that she'll make a mistake any time soon. I want to try this. I'm in a room watching a pornographic video. My dad and sister Heather are there. There is a woman hooked up to a washing machine in the video. He legs are bound and something is putting pressure on her vagina. The machine bends and stretches her, putting pressure on and squeezing her legs and body. This is erotic. We seem to take turns masturbating, sitting or laying on some sort of trunk or box. The lady in the video is being tortured. Baseball is on television. Someone hit a foul ball. There are several bunk beds in the room. Joe Girardi is up to bat, and he hits a home run. I ejaculate when he does this. My high school classmate Binky Ahmed asks me why the Minnesota Twins didn't win the World Series. It seems that we've been watching the 1987 National League Championship Series. I say, and he says, that it's the little things that count: like the turning of a double play or having people on the disabled list.",Negative

"I was leaving Kmart.  We were looking for shoes for Littlest Pet Shop.  Hungry, we ordered pizza.  My mother handed me a small bottle of green liquid.  I wasn't going to get it, but then did because the man was looking at us.  It was supposed to be like $5 but on the checkout it was listed as $75.  We left and my mother was going to go into the grocery store.  She didn't want me to come, even though I really need to go shopping.  We were driving around in circles.  Finally I said stop!  I realized I didn't even know who was driving.  It was my father, and he was impatient.  Then, something about an accident.  Not from my father but our 'driver'.  Someone gave a testimony of being driven straight over in a little plane.",Negative
"The first part of the dream involved Cuba, and a voice from somewhere seemed to be providing the commentary asking about when is someone finally going to take action to release all the royalty from Cuba. It seems as if Cuba had somehow imprisoned large numbers of reigning royalty, and this was a news commentator who was expressing his dissatisfaction over our weak position and failure to act upon this matter with regard to Cuba. Then I was walking along the streets in Cuba, and as I crossed the street, I noticed all of these people lining the streets and I knew that they were the royalty. I was curious about them and started to move in their direction, but then a rather old, seedy-looking man who was the guard, started to approach me. I quickly exited because I was afraid that I would be caught and made a prisoner myself. The guard was carrying a gun, but was old, probably in his late 60's or early 70's, and I was surprised at this because he didn't appear to be what one would ordinarily expect for a guard. I had a fleeting look at the royalty and they all seemed to be dressed the same, in fatigues and combat boots. They were sort of shuffling along and looked extremely dejected and miserable. Then I was wondering to myself about their rather sorry-looking condition, and thinking that one would never know they were royalty from their appearance, and thinking that royalty was not very proper because the only claim to fame for most of them was that they happened to be born to influential parents and had not really done anything to receive commendation for themselves. I was saying to myself that if they really had any strong character, they should be finding some way of pooling their resources to escape. Then the scene shifted and it was some kind of hut. I was continuing to say something to myself about what sort of qualities could be inherited. In the hut was a large, well-muscled, vicious man who was chained to the wall. It seemed there were also one or two other people chained to the wall, but nowhere near as impressive in physical size or apparent ferocity as this one figure. Some man walked by them who had the reputation for toughness and walked up to a counter, I think, at the end of this hut to order something. As he walked by the chained-up giant, he threw an ice cube at him. I was saying something about dominant and recessive genes, that experiencing cold or some other kind of thing was related to dominant characteristics. It seems as if the ice cube had hit this giant or large man in the face and he spit the ice cube back out, and some of it landed on my face. I became furious and started to hit him with both fists in the face. Then he started to punch me. I spit at his face, and he continued to punch me, and I decided that no matter how hard I was hit or how much punishment I received that I wasn't going to quit, and that I was going to continue to spit back in his face It seems as if I had received this courage or decided to take this stand because I wanted to impress the person who had walked into the room, down toward the counter. I don't know who this person was in the dream. Here was something else about what would happen afterward, but I don't know what this was. What would happen afterward to me? It seemed as if it were more what would happen to him after this incident. By I mean the giant. Time [end]",Negative
"Two men and I are traveling to T City to visit Dora again. I had visited lately and it was very enjoyable. The one man is sort of Derek but is sort of Kyle, but I call him Dwight, although it seems to me his name may be something else. The other man is his younger brother and is pretty much Kyle's younger brother, the one that molested Charla. I ask what vehicle we are in and he says it's their Dad's vacation camper. It is a square box-like thing with tiny kitchen appliances. I try to explain how to get to Dora's new place, called Paradise Cove, but I can't remember, so I am trying to read the maps. I can't seem to find T City on the map and I try repeatedly. Now the younger brother says, ""I'm exhausted from driving; it has cramped me up,"" and I look at the other brother who says, ""I can't, I'm too tired."" I say, ""Maybe I can, is it power steering and brakes?"" ""Yes."" I try to steer, but it is a small crank handle and isn't very responsive. We are getting nowhere fast.",Positive

Why should I have to pay out of my own pocket?"" I can see the reasoning on this and feel bad and caught between Dwight and the two women. I explain to them.",Negative
"Was driving with my family in our automobile when we came to the corner of my street and the car in front of us had two little children sitting on the roof of the car. As the car turned the corner, one of the little girls was hurled into the street and another car ran over her. Since we were the only witnesses of the accident and therefore it was our responsibility to get help. I didn't know where to find a doctor, so it seemed as if it took me hours and hours to reach a friend's home. After finally arriving there, I couldn't get in touch with a doctor. Finally I got a Dr. Meyers of whom I never heard of, but it was too late. We were held guilty for the accident.",Negative

Oh yes, and a little dog. We were on a dock that jutted out into the ocean. It was a beautiful day, sunny and gorgeous, but the ocean had white caps on it and it was a little bit rocky. The dock was rocking. (Of course, I have never been out on the ocean in my life.) We wanted to go swimming, but we didn't have any bathing suits with us. And so I heard a radio broadcast (I don't know how there was none there, or anything), but I heard Jimmy Fidler saying that all the movie actresses in Los Angeles were swimming without anything on because the white caps hid them. Anyway, so we thought if they can do it, why couldn't we? So we all undressed down to our underclothes (we were a little more modest) and we went swimming.",Positive

He has a three-page movie script that he has written. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. She reads Mark's script.

"Myself and my father (and perhaps some other family members) had entered a tv show as participants - it was a dance show. First we warmed up dancing freestyle altogether on a dance floor to pop/disco music. I was trying not to stand out. Later we had to perform individually to different themes, then there was voting by judges. Some of the female contestants went into 'diary room' mode and burst into tears complaining about the harsh judges and how much this means to them. I walked off the show because I was fed up with how seriously everyone was taking it. I thought I'd look cool, but when watching it back on a tv monitor afterwards, I noticed that I'd sounded like I was doing it for attention too, and worse, I noticed a tear rolling down my cheek, and my voice trembling.

I push things off my desk and grab a typewriter and begin to furiously type anything that comes to mind. A pretty good story gets done. I determinedly finish it, ignoring as best I can the unruly children. Now I go out into the living room. It's a mess, with furniture moved all around, stuff all over. I go out to the mailbox on the porch and get the mail. As I am looking at what came, I see maybe five vans or station wagons pull up. The kids are back home. One vehicle is for Dovre, one for Ellie and her family and so on. I am surprised there are so many. I see that the clothes I had ordered for Howard's Christmas present have come in the mail. Now I call to the kids to come into the house NOW. I am angry and demand they come. They saunter in, being insolent and rude. I slap some on the face repeatedly. I yell at them. I make them all sit on the couch and I rail into them. I say, ""Things are going to change around here."" I know 50% of this is my fault and 50% is their fault. I hear me thinking (for them) that if there are five of them and 50% is their total fault, then only ___% is each individual's share of the fault.

Later the water is back in the pool and I think of swimming then, but remember the water needs to stand for awhile to let the bacteria or something leave. Bonnie is there somewhere.

The next scene was in a garage where I was with a boy my own age who was trying to get the car in a tight parking place.

"I was sitting on a ledge overlooking a part of ocean.  My old obnoxious dorm roommate Chelsea was also on the ledge.  Someone in the water was working with a very small man- about a foot tall.  The idea was that the man would surf, and the little man would 'surf' on the guy's back, I guess.  Their practices were going very well.  Somehow there was a very tanned woman also involved in the stunt.  I made a comment about history.  The woman made some snide remark, and I said she didn't know what she was talking about.  I got in the water and swam over to the man to tell him what I was thinking.  I don't know why I had said history- my concern was that they weren't accounting for inertia and that the little man could easily slide off.  The guy brushed off my concern.  He made some comment about being in love with the woman.  We swam out a little ways to the left, and I realized how unusually warm the water was- like bathwater.

We went for a little walk, and I was still angry and verbalizing some of my anger when he changed the subject and said something about his wife Sheila having a martini.  I didn't understand the point, and asked if it meant she was losing her faith as a Jehovah's Witness.  Apparently it meant she was losing her motivation in life, that she was depressed.",Negative

"There was a hot pink blanket 50 x 51 inches. The tag gave the dimensions. I was suppose to fold up the blanket but I couldn't fold it good so I wadded it up and walked with it on my head.

"I believe I was a teacher. I took a group of teenagers, along with another adult that I was working with, to some building. We went inside the building. It was a mess. It was dirty and rundown. There was little if anything inside the large room that we were in. I said this would be great. It seemed to be perfect for whatever we wanted it for. At that time, I don't know that I knew what we were looking for. The teens were complaining and such. We went to work cleaning it up and trying to make it usable. I came back into the room and the teens had done a great job fixing it up. There was furniture, pictures hanging on the walls, etc. I took a microphone and told them how very proud I was of them. I told them that I remembered what it was like to be their age, young, afraid, no one to talk to. I told them to feel free to call me at home anytime if they needed someone to talk to. I then handed the microphone to the other adult but don't remember anything that person said. Finally, I told the teens there would be one rule about this room. That rule is confidentiality. Anything that is said in that room stays in that room. That way they would feel safe discussing anything in there.",Positive
"I saw an old man. He wanted to play football with the boy when I came up close to him. He was not so old. He got a monocle from a fellow and put it to his eye. It made a double vision. I could see two eyes and when he looked at two eyes, it was four. My sister Sue came from PA and brought some catsup pies and my brother Steve and I said we didn't like them. I said cabbage was the best. I took them back to the rubbish and there was a 4 ft. hole in the ground to put the rubbish in.",Positive

"I dreamed last night that I was back working for my job in the art books section. The department was located in some old ruined dorm at my high school. Yet I was somehow very close to the Alps and everywhere else in Europe. I had to snowboard throughout Europe (which was tricky enough since I can't snowboard) and steal art for my job in exchange for cocaine. And I don't know why but I was trying to acquire 40 grams of it. Aaron was there and was talking to Britta, even though he had come to visit me. I sent them on a tour of Europe to keep them busy while I tried to find the 40 grams of cocaine. Then I woke up.",Positive

"I went to some science school thing. It was very secure. I was in the lobby area and no-one was there. I looked behind the desk area, which had a glass window showing another area, and I saw a guy walking away from me. I knocked on the door and he turned around and looked at me. He explained to us they'd accidentally released some zombie virus. I can't remember exactly what was said, but it was contagious through a weird way. It could be instantly transferred through a bite or whatever, but you could get infected and it wouldn't take hold until a certain thing set it off (think it had something to do with a kind of food). He couldn't leave the quarantined area because he was infected, but it hadn't been set off. We left and walked past another area of the school where some of the scientists seemed to be just working as usual and we realised it had only just happened. As we were leaving we saw zombies coming out of the area and we got to this huge shopping centre. At the top was some kind of helicopter ride. We started making our way up there and as we got a few storeys up, we saw the zombies starting to come in to the shop. We got to the top and they said they had one more space in a helicopter and my group sent me. But they let me and this guy, who was my boyfriend or something, on and still had another spot, which they didn't fill. The helicopter started flying and flew out this window, but then it stalled and started to fall. This had happened before and I grabbed a railing on a building outside and this gave it enough time to start spinning fast enough to fly. When we came back from the ride, everybody was gone. We collected a few chocolates and things from the shop and went outside. I said ""it's a ghost town"" and started singing the song 'Ghost Town' by The Specials. We wondered if it was because we were in a 'desert town' and had gone to find more people or if they would come out at night or something. We did come across some at some point and found these outside showers and covered ourselves in water because we thought they wouldn't see us and they didn't seem to be able to, but we were worried it would evaporate quickly.",Negative

"I was on a street. There was a printing press there about 500 feet long. There was no pressman around. Sheets about 4 by 4 feet were being printed. I tried to take one of the sheets out as they went along the conveyor belt into the bin. But when I took out a sheet, the other sheets began to jam. I could not understand what caused them to jam since I was careful not to jam them when I took out the sheet. I looked for a switch to turn off the press, but it stopped automatically.

"In the dream I have fallen on hard times and I have to live in a squat in London. My mental health is not good, so I don't end up washing or eating properly. I turn up a a friend's house, where there is a gathering in a fairly cramped flat. We settled down on various mismatching seats and couches which are covered in blankets, to watch a film on the internet that apparently I have seen before and recommend to the others. It turns out that the film features me (the 'me' that has the squat and mental health issues). I remember looking down at my legs at one point, and noticing that they are bruised and that one of them has a huge blister on it. It looks like leprosy or some very serious skin disease. There's a scene in the film where I drive a car up some steps and smash through someone's front door and into their flat. The occupants run away from the car which is still moving, chasing them from room to room, smashing down the thin walls between them.",Negative
I was driving through St. Joe. Matthew was in the car with me. As we were driving I saw some small children along the road in a few places. It was Halloween. They were wearing costumes and were out Trick or Treating. I was shocked to see a baby. As I continued to drive I saw something lying in the road in front of me. I tried to slow down but was afraid I was not going to be able to miss it. I swerved enough so my car went over the top of it but none of the tires or anything hit. As I passed over it I realized it was that baby. I slammed on the brakes and pulled to the side of the road and went back and picked up the baby. There was a toddler standing alone along the side of the road where the baby was. No one else was anywhere in site. We put the baby and the toddler in the car with us and went to the mother's. The baby was wrapped in a light blue blanket and her name was Kylie. As I unwrapped the blanket I found a brown wallet. It looked like a man's wallet and it was stuffed full of papers and pictures. I didn't even look to see if there was any money in it. I started going through it quickly hoping to figure out who the baby was and who her parents were. I found a picture of several teenage girls. Bev was in the picture. She was at mother's too so I asked her to look at the picture and see if she could remember who the other girls were in the picture. She pointed to one and said that was Kylie. We got out the phone book and looked up her parents phone number. I called and got an answering machine and left a message for the mother. After a while she had not called me back so I called again and left another message. After a short time the father called back. When I spoke to him he said they had intentionally left the children there. That were going through a very difficult time financially and they just couldn't afford to keep the children. My initial reaction was that I was furious but I knew it would do no good to say anything to him so I just said okay and hung up. I started thinking about what I should do next. The thought of keeping the children occurred to me. Then I was thinking about the fact that they can pay a phone bill but they can't keep their children. Why don't they cut expenses some other ways like cutting off their phone rather than just dumping their children on the road? I have a sense that they have more children and they kept them. I thought the appropriate thing to do would be to call child social services. Then I thought about Chrisy R and Mark R and how many times they have fostered children and wondered about just asking them to take the children and handle everything since they know who to talk to and the process and everything.,Negative

"I went to the bank to cash a bond, then walked down the street window shopping. In one of the stores, I noticed a woman sitting tied and gagged in a chair in front of the door. There was a chair under the door knob on the outside and as I tried to remove it, the woman shook her head no. I then realized the store was probably being robbed, so I tried to get out of that doorway and into the one next door before the man came out and saw me, but my legs wouldn't move. Finally the man came out and saw me, but my legs wouldn't move. Finally after what seemed to be a great struggle, I did it. I stayed there for a while trying to make myself small. The store wasn't open and there was no one on the street. I began to worry that the man would come out and see me, so I decided to venture farther down the street. Again, my legs wouldn't move.

"Family's Free Meal  I'm at a restaurant with my mom, my brother Wally, and sister Heather and Ramona. The restaurant is in the city in a shopping mall. We order and eat. The waitress is crabby and short-tempered. Several waiters are there to help clear away the dishes when we're done. A man comes to our table. He seems to be the manager. He is wearing dark pants, a white shirt with stripes, and a tie. He wants my mom to write a check to pay for the meal, and then he'll give her cash. This somehow benefits him. He estimates the cost of our meal using a calculator. He figures my mom's meal to be about five dollars, and everyone else's meal to be about $2.75. I had what my mom had plus an appetizer, so I figure my meal will be the most expensive, costing more than seven dollars. My meal costs a lot more than the others. The man figures the cost of the meal to be about $25. He gives mom a $20 bill and $5 for a tip. He comes back a little bit later and says that $25 isn't enough to pay for the bill, and gives mom a $50 bill. Wally, Ramona, and Heather order more food. I don't realize they do this until it arrives at the table. When it does, they are not at the table. I eat whatever it is that I can, stuffing it into my mouth. The food consists of fried appetizers. My mom writes a check to pay for the meal. The man ends up paying for the whole meal. The waitpersons are crabby and impatient. We walk out of the restaurant.

It was getting dark and no one was around. She banged on the window and said, ""Give me your money, bitch."" I tried desperately to start the car. Finally, it started. When it started, the girl pulled out a knife. I struggled, but got the car in reverse and drove away as fast as I could. I was lost and could not find my way to the apartment I was supposed to be renting. Zack had made the arrangements and was supposed to meet me there. I stopped to ask, what looked like a bus driver, where Main Street was. He said I was not far; it was up just past the next exit. Then I was on foot again. Somehow I ended up running with the bus driver. He guided me to Main Street, and then he was gone. Zack was there. We entered the building, which did not look very nice at all. We went upstairs. I put the key in and when I opened the door, there were people sleeping in there. There was a man in the hall who said that it wasn't my apartment. He called the manager to come. There were many people hanging out in the hall now. When the lady arrived, she said she had another apartment, but it wasn't cleaned out yet. A man had rented it, but he left and didn't take his stuff. We went to see it. We were looking around and I noticed a pair of boots that looked just like my dad's. Then I saw some other stuff that was his. I called him. He said it was his stuff. When he got arrested, he couldn't go back and get it I told the lady what happened and started packing his stuff.",Negative
"Matthew was with me. I was trying to find the church that I take our parish's donations to. They have a little white shed for missions behind their church. I was having trouble finding it. In part of it we were in a car, I was driving. Part of it we were walking through a building. We ended up in a Methodist church. We were sitting in one of the pews during a service. I told Matthew that grandma used to be a Methodist and that their services are very similar to that of a Catholic Mass. We were in an office. We walked down a long hall and into an office directly at the end of the hall. We were looking for someone by a specific name, though I can't remember the name now. We wanted to buy a KTC card. When we walked into his office he was on the phone. He acknowledged us and ended his phone call. When I told him why we were there he looked at us like he didn't know what we were talking about. After I said something else he said, yes, yes, and started shuffling through the piles of papers on his desk. I realized that we must be the first ones to buy one from him. They had just reopened the company and just beginning to market them again. He was obviously not prepared as I appeared to be the first person requesting to purchase one.",Positive
"I was walking along a road or street somewhere when I came upon a book which had apparently been thrown out of a car which had just passed.  It was entitled Step Four.  A little bit farther, I came upon one entitled Step Two.  I wondered what happened to Steps One and Three.  A little bit farther I came upon a bunch of tables which were set up for a church supper.  Marvin Martinalle was there.  I felt a little embarrassed talking to him, since we hadn't been to church in so long.  He commented on the books I had, and I told him I had been looking for Teilhard de Chardin.",Negative
"I was at the university with a boyfriend and a girlfriend and later we went out, but a Philosophy professor I used to have appeared and started giving a series of opinions about the Kennedy family. We arrived at an eating place, and the owner was a very strange lady. There were no other people in the place; the place was empty. Suddenly three men with guitars appeared from the back. The lady sat with us and asked us what we were going to have. Since we couldn't make up our minds, the teacher said that we should first go to the school where he taught to let them know he wouldn't come to class. We went out and walked to the school. When we arrived, it was an old and big house with a garden outside in which there were swings and children's games. The children were playing there and when we arrived, they looked at us and the professor told them that he was not going to have a class and -- strangest thing -- they started to make fun and laugh at him. I can't remember any more.",Positive
"We went to Ms Nowak's class which was in this big lecture theatre. It was only some of the class. At the front were a list of shows and movies and other categories. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Young Ones were there and I said 'no one pick my favourite movie'. Ms Nowak said she knew I'd say that and had made a decision about groups. Bryce was in class and we all had green wristbands. The rest of the people came in and most had red bands, including Tristan and Frederick. I was annoyed she'd separated me and Tristan. We all got paired up with someone and attached to them. Justus and Frederick were together. Marcos was with someone else. We had to do some project together. I was avoiding Frederick but kept looking at him and missed him.",Negative

"The Small Basketball Court  I arrive at Carter School with my sister Heather. This is a new school for us. We're about our age now, but may be younger, in our teens. I'm in a sports club with my brother Wally, Heather, and a white man. We're in a small room. The man is a basketball player. We go to a small gymnasium. There are a group of black and white men gathering to play basketball. I have on my white, new-looking Nike basketball shoes to play. The hoops are small: about eight inches wide, and about seven feet high. The game starts. There are two referees. I want to get in the game and see how I'll play. I think that I'll play okay.",Positive
"It's Halloween and I am at home and need to get to someone's house, where I'm apparently spending the night. I don't think I know this person in waking life. My mother is supposed to be getting me ready to go over there and it's about 6:00 p.m. and she's moving really slowly. (I don't know what she has to do). I go upstairs and see some books I don't have in the bookcase behind my bed. One of them is a book version of the movie ""Election,"" hardcover, and priced over $20. I thought that maybe my grandmother had bought it for me. My mother is still in the bathroom doing something or other (probably getting herself ready to bring me), and there's toast in the toaster for a sandwich. I hear my brother leave the house, and then see there's only one piece of toast in the toaster. I'm really in a hurry now, and my mother yells at my brother who's walking down the street. He pretends not to hear and when she calls again he runs like 5 feet away and then looks back to listen to her. I'm not sure what she said but I don't think it was about my toast! I don't remember what happened then, except that I went down to the bottom of the street to catch a ride to school from some seniors from last year- I remember Wesley and others. The car looks like a convertible, and we're driving down the street. All of a sudden, I remember thinking, ""We've been driving here a while. I thought in dreams, scenes changed often and people were always actively doing something."" I wasn't really lucid, but I wasn't aware of the time we'd been driving down the road until I sort of realized I was in a dream. If that wasn't enough to make me lucid, I then thought, ""It's the middle of summer! School's not starting yet,"" and I became a bit more lucid at that point. There was a cute blonde girl in the back seat, who I called over to the front (I don't even know if I said anything. I could have just motioned, or maybe just thought about it). I had her put her legs on my lap.",Negative
"I was watching an episode of The Outer Limits. Frank Whaley was in it. He and this guy were friends and he always took this bus. He was worried about a white light. These people were after him and to go to him, I had to go through the aisles of a video shop. One of the times I grabbed some movies and one of them was Invasion of the Body Snatchers with Donald Sutherland. This guy said something and I said ""Yeah, it's the remake"". One day we were riding the bus and it was weird. I tried to get over to Frank, but I fell into a seat nearby. This guy was talking to him across the bus. I went into the seat next to him and he held my hand. An impression of a monkey's face appeared in the seat in front of him. We looked at each other worried and then there was a bright light and then he was gone. It had happened to someone before. The other guy got off and was in a crowded area. His face turned monkey-like and people started screaming. Then I was watching this other episode and this girl and some other people were jumping off this bridge, but they didn't get hit by cars and landed in this gymnastic area. Her sister was naked and kept having hallucinations.",Negative
Uncle Gabriel had made this big garden. There were coins and he had made a garden from a coin. We were somewhere with this family. The father looked like John Schneider. He had a lump on his leg and it was shaped like a shark head. The mother wanted a photo of the family in the pool. The father was going to show me some 80's thing which had something to do with the coins. The house looked like Mom's house and Mom was there too. Ezra was listening to Johnny Get Angry on the XBOX 360 and was dancing.,Positive
"Heather's Uterus Destroyed  I seem to be near the church across from Social Science Hall at Brimson. Two men with guns are robbing a man in a car. One of the robbers is holding a gun inches from the victim's head, pointing it at his head. The other robber stands about 15 feet in back of the car pointing his gun at the victim, who is the driver. I'm walking with several guys, including my classmate Doug Thompson. I'm not sure how to react when I see the robbery. I move cautiously. The man being robbed tells us to keep walking, past the car. I do. The man drives away. The robbers fire their guns when the man is at a distance, and don't hit him. The others that were with me are still back near the robbers, while I slowly and anxiously keep walking. The robbers rob the other men I was with. I start to run and get away. I'm running down 1st Street in Oak Valley, going from where it intersects Bauer Avenue to where the white house is on the corner of it intersection with Holy Avenue. I see a black woman outside the house and I yell to her from a distance to call 911. When I get to the house I enter through the front door. I go through the dimly lit living room where there is a huge television with many dull colors showing on it. I enter the kitchen where the lights are brighter, and see the woman talking on the phone to the 911 operator. I tell the woman what I know about the two robbers: one is white, about 5'11"", with shaggy brown hair that sticks out from under his winter-type cap, and he had a gun, which was like a six-shooter, that seemed silver, gray, or blue. The other four men I was with, including Doug, have escaped the robbers, and they arrive at the house. The others are younger than Doug. I ask one of them, who is a young black boy, about the second robber. The boy says the second robber was white. I talk on a cellular phone. The 911 operator asks me to hang up, because she can't talk to the woman and I at the same time: there is an electrical or communication problem. I hang up. There is a loud wail in the basement. I go downstairs to see what it is. My sister Heather is there. She has been sexually touched or hurt. Her uterus is sterile, and it is destroyed. She is kneeling on the floor sobbing. There is blood on the floor, walks, and pipes to the sink: essentially everywhere. She kneels and wails while she scoops up bits of bloody intestine-like tissue. These are bits of her uterus. She scrapes them into a pile on the blood-covered floor.",Negative

I retrieved some and replenished the fish.",Positive
"I am in a small group of people who are coming up with story ideas. It is my turn and so I think back to what I'd been experiencing in the dream before and use part of that as the story. I say, ""There's this military man whose father was into nuclear stuff, a professor, and he doesn't want to have anything to do with that stuff. He meets a woman who is excellent at different sports and an outdoors type. The challenge is..."" I don't remember the rest. I then say, ""I know it's similar to a movie I saw once."" Then there is an interruption. Two teen girls come into the store to buy something. I turn to see what they need. The teacher says they are in the wrong store if they want jewelry. I say, ""Oh, no, there is jewelry in this store; you just can't see it from where you are sitting."" I describe what I see, which is a long wall filled with jewelry, and then the far right end has the ribbons and buttons and sewing notions he had seen. I get up to wait on the two girls, who seem to want to try on all the pretty jewelry and obviously don't have the money to pay for things. I want them to finish so I can go back and work on the story.",Positive
"I and 3 or 4 other people, they were men, I believe, were climbing down a fairly steep gravel hill up at Camp near my hometown, and I had our little daughter with me. I was being careful that she wouldn't fall or something like that. We got to the bottom and I think there were one or two other events I don't recall. There was just me and another girl, which might or might not have been my wife; I don't really recall. We also had our baby daughter with us. We had to stay there overnight or something like that rather than climb back. Then it was early next morning and our daughter's diaper was dirty. We didn't have anything to change her into. So we had to leave that one diaper on her, and we were thinking about climbing up the mountain again with her and thinking about how this would give us some sort of distinction of being the first people to climb this mountain with a baby with a dirty diaper. I think we climbed it. I'm not sure. Then we were back in camp.",Positive
"My brother Tony and I have a large truck, a refrigerated truck. We were going in on a business deal together. We were half way to Forty Mile Bend when we stopped at a house and met a few of our friends. It started to get late and we decided to stay the night. About 7:00 p.m. we discovered four girls were missing (little girls 2-6 who lived at the house). We found that they were in the back of the truck and the freezer was on. But for some reason we couldn't let them out till morning. We very carefully let the air out of the tires on one side of the truck (reason?). We couldn't let the girls out because it was too dark. Morning came and four of us went in to get them out. The inside of the truck was icy and frosty. The girl I took out was able still to talk and was talking to me as if nothing had happened. All four girls should have been frozen solid. As I talked to the girl I brought out, the more I noticed she was made of stainless steel and didn't have a head. The other three girls were alright.",Negative
"We were at a party. I see one man fall over. Bill Freedman got over him and he seemed to be dead. Bill held his eyes open with his fingers and he dipped his head under water. Then he would bring him up. He seemed dead. He was given up as dead. Bill's wife was yelling Uncle Craig. After he was given up as dead, all at once he came to life and he was surprisingly young. He came over and stuck his hand down on my sex organs and I was struggling to get away. I finally did. I was kicking a ball around with some men and kids. I was running after a fellow just in fun. I was watching a man pass a test. He did some very great feats to become a priest. I went to a different place to pass the test. A man asked for three copperhead snakes. He held them in front of me. I got hold of one's mouth and ripped him open. Then I got the other two and pulled off their heads and threw them into a water puddle. The man paid no attention to what I was doing. He thought it was my end, but he was surprised when he saw the beheaded snakes in the water. I did the same with rattlesnakes before the copperheads. I passed the test. The man met John Lasko (deceased) and showed John what I did to him when I met him before the test. I made a dare of gouging out his eyes or poking at them. I met Helen and June Lasko.",Negative

"My parents and I were exploring a sort of large white globe structure.  There were cavities in it but we didn't explore those.  It was a strange place.  There were a bunch of overweight 'country bumpkins' standing on a set of bleachers, modeling some nice clothes.  They looked silly in the nice clothes because their faces/hair/speech gave them away, but they stood there smiling nonetheless.  They wanted something from us but we weren't about to give it to them.  We ignored them and passed on by.  Then I stood looking up toward my father, who was standing somewhat above me, as if he were my king.  I spoke to him jokingly role-playing the 'uneducated hick', speaking poorly.  I had to go back from where we'd come to get something.  I passed the modelers again and when I arrived back at the spot, my old best friend Candy was there. She was a queen, and I treated her as such, not as a person who had once been my best friend.   I spoke to her briefly and I think I gave her something.

There are lots of strange-looking glasses, blue, pretty, odd-shaped, multi-colored. I then stand at one of three sinks and start washing dishes.

The show hasn't started, won't for a while yet - this isn't entertainment we've come for, but something maybe political or social, something dramatic - I think we're planning to ""do"" something ourselves and that's why there's this tension, a real sober undercurrent among us; I don't know about the other people here.

"An overall underlying feeling of the dream was something to the effect of everything was moving along smoothly in the sense that, I mean, the action was just coming piece after piece. It was just a smooth falling setting in action. Then there seems to be no reason at all the action tries to go backwards and there's this conflict like a smooth circle and then this pulling back or sort of down. It's a very difficult image to explain, but in the dream action moves along smoothly and then one character started pulling or struggling with another and this is what created the feeling of pulling down and backwards. At first it was just a matter of a struggle and then I saw myself in that struggle. As the dream became more clear, it seemed to be at an airport, and many people. There's just a disruption in the even flow of traffic or movement of a crowd, but I couldn't tell exactly who the struggle was with, just a disruption in the flow of activity. At the beginning of the struggle it was like trying to force the victim underneath water such as like a drowning. Keep someone's head under or something like this, and there was a lot of movement as far as resistance fighting.",Positive
"Sex On Newspaper  I'm at my grandpa and grandma Redding's old farm. I am in the living room with my girlfriend Annie Thomas. We start to have sex in a weird position.

"We are on patrol somewhere in Nam. It is not my old unit but the feelings are the same. We are, the infantry lurking in the jungle. As usual we are spread apart, perhaps 4 to 5 meters between each man. The foliage ahead grows less and less dense.; one can see 25· to 30 meters forward, it is somewhat like the better terrain we encountered in Tay Ninh. I anticipate an ambush; things are going too easily. Beyond the stillness of our own guarded movements I sense another. With the first starting shots I drop instinctively to the ground. These are not the familiar popping sounds of the AK, though nonetheless I have anticipated correctly, we are in contact. Those up front fire back, immediately killing two. Then from my position I see two or three heads begin to rise. I yell to the others, at the same time pointing the muzzle of my 16 in the enemy's direction and attempting to fire. The gun jams. Quickly I reload another magazine and pull the trigger. Again nothing, but the others have caught on and the enemy attack seems over. From the background I hear a sharp whining recoil; it is nothing like our 105s or 155s. The number 106 flashes through my mind, though I am not sure if there is such a weapon; perhaps light weapons, but as the shells fall I realize they are undoubtedly heavy artillery. The first explosions fall outside our perimeter; they do not descend like mortars, nor do they explode like artillery. On impact there is a sharp thunder-clap, followed by earth-like clouds of swirling, thick and heavy dust; though it is curious, these manifestations are small and hug the ground. Soon the shells drop closer and' closer to us, and I hear the shrapnel whizzing over. Finally one lands almost on top of me and I imagine a large piece of steel penetrating the flesh of my back. There is no pain, but I realize this to be a death wound. The last moments of the dream are obscured by the dust clouds.",Negative
"(12/04/00)[""Aliens kill nightmare.""] I/a woman is entering an airplane. The dream ego is watching from behind her. I see her feet stepping into the raised carpeted stairs in the aisle as she steps down each step like in a raked seating situation. She walks to the front. She turns to the right and pulls out a black pistol and fires into the chest of a passenger, male. A man stands up and also pulls out a gun and begins to kill passengers. Between the two they kill every passenger. Then they throw the bodies out the windows on one side. They are aliens. Another I (the dream ego) is in another airplane, in the cockpit. The Captain tensely says to his crew to lock the door. I see people falling out of the other airplane. The crew member nearest the door is afraid and fumbles as he tries to lock the door. The lock turns and holds. They know it's aliens and they are next. I wake up afraid.",Negative

I was very confused because I thought Phil had previously told me that he couldn't go with us that Saturday, so I made arrangements to go with another couple.",Positive

"I'm observing an operation, but I'm not standing in the room or even outside the room looking in. The surgical team is getting ready to operate on this woman. They haven't started yet because they have a number of concerns what seems to be at least one question that is very important that it be answered before they do anything. The question has something to do with something that she ate or may have eaten. They were concerned that it may have had a Koa Nut in it and if so the surgery would be much more dangerous and/or they would have to proceed differently, or maybe not at all. They were discussing the case. If she had eaten a Koa Nut, do they do anything with that? Do they need to? If so, what? Someone said something about a cereal that she eats on a regular basis, which has raisins and something else in it, maybe some kind of grain. This makes them realize that it does not have any nuts in it. Now they're confident that she has not eaten a Koa Nut. Now they know that it's okay to go ahead with the surgery. They are operating on her and they decide that the problem is a bad kidney so they removed her kidney. Then they also discovered that she had a double-hernia and so they removed that. A woman on the surgical team held up this very large organ, using a pair of surgical tongs, and said, it might have been this double hernia. It was oval in shape and about the size of a football.",Negative

And I was sitting down to make it, and it was like 9:30 at night, and I figured I'd better hurry just in case. And so I called what I thought was the, it was called the radio phone line for some reason, and it led into the Drama and Band Department.

I see a blue cup with the picture of a cat on the inside and I'm holding my cat under my arm who sticks her nose into the cup to see it better. I say, ""How pretty it is,"" hoping she'll give it to me, but she doesn't. I walk up a flight of stairs and look out the window (see drawing).

I'm reluctant, because it's so far and dark - there's quite a few trees, and I've been threatened with kidnapping [I don't know why], and I'm scared to be alone. Just the same I start across, and right away someone starts coming after me - I don't know where he's actually come from but he's dark - can't see what he really looks like - trench coat and hat I think. I can dodge him but I don't think I can outrun him all the way to the back of the yard. I start yelling. Brad and An important person can't hear me - it's too far. I yell louder and louder and I'm afraid they'll never hear me, but finally they do. There's a fence back there, too, and I've got to get all the way to the right corner where the gate is, so it's even farther.

My friends were playing tennis across the street, so I went. Me and Polly wanted to leave, but we couldn't find the way out. Finally, after riding our bikes around a gigantic house/forest, I opened a closet which led to a door. I opened the door and the forest was there, so we went out. While I was crossing the street, a car came straight at me, so I jumped off. Cars kept going by until one finally stopped to help. I had to go because I was called for a camping trip.

I was working on getting it started and it was pretty dark outside. This double-size dog ran up to me, followed by one other dog who was more vicious than the first one. I tried to blow on the fire to make it come up brighter so they might be frightened away, but the fire didn't burn very brightly and the big dog came up and started talking to each other, and he also restrained the smaller dog from getting vicious or attacking me.

"I always wanted a job, and somehow I am working on a project with someone I know but can't remember.  It's like this:  On a great platform about 5 or 6 feet high, there are many molds about 3 or 4 feet square, made of iron.  At one end of the platform is a pole about the size of a good-sized flagpole.  It is the end of a long machine serving as a conveyor belt or something.  It looks just like the rear of a 1958 Cadillac but stretched out to about 40 feet long, with scallops and dips in the whole length of it.  The molds have scalloped edges too-sort of like a cornbread stick mold or a knife sharpener.  From a pulley atop the pole, an iron block is quickly lowered by a rope which I hold.  Each one falls into a mold and assumes that shape.  Once, I get up onto the platform to try to do something to one of the molds, but the person I am working with says my hand will look like one of the molds.  So I use a stick instead, and retreat back over the molds.  The footing is very tricky.  There are also some large black oil drums.  I'm not sure what the ""Cadillac"" thing is, but every once in a while one end rises way up and comes back down.  On the opposite side of the machine is a large tree, and beyond that is a little store.  You can't see the ""Cadillac"" from the back door of the store because of the tree.  I take someone around the tree and show them the machine.  They are amazed.  I stop once and go in to see if Jim Wheeler has come yet.  He has just got there.",Negative

"I was designing an annual report, only it was covering many years of my life. The headlines were red (Section 1), blue (Section 2) and yellow (Section 3) (most recent) in Trade Gothic Bold Italic, 72 pt. (try ex. bd. ital alt., 10 pt. trade gothic bold) 100% K. These tables, designed beautifully, were about my screw-ups in life. There were many. There was a stack--scattered--of photos of Dora--years worth of me and Dora together. The empty stack place was missed photo opportunities when I was screwing up bad. It was COLD. I got a coffee on 7th St. and went to the gallery. I needed clean socks. Marianna told me there was a pillowcase full. A plastic bag hanging there looked extra heavy and the weight of the bag was as if it were filled with mercury--but very heavy plastic bag of carbon powder in there--the bag was--the consistency of very heavy, very fine granulated into near dust, powder. It kept the bag from moving. I saw a sign for flip flops and though I was in a hurry, I vowed to myself (that) I'd get some.",Positive

We started going in before we were called (lots of us) so only five of us were allowed. These young twins left and then it was either me and Calvin or me and Ezra. We were only allowed a laptop.

It ate through things so I had to put the LAN cord and all my cords up high.",Positive

The boys and I picked all black. This guy came and he thought we were the proper 'astronaut' people. He believed us, until he asked me how my 'Dad' was, as he was sick. I said ""Uh... yeah, I dunno,"" and then he got his buddies and they put us in this car. We got transferred to another car, and Dad was driving it. Jayson didn't sit in the car though, he held onto the door from outside. When Dad stopped, he jumped off and ran, but Dad let us go too. Calvin and I left and we ran and hid behind these trees. But the people saw and took us again. Then we were at some place with water, which had evil fish. These people would call someone out and they had to stay in the water and get back to their spot to win, or if they got bit 5 times, or 20 times, they could get out. I got called and I got bitten. At the end, someone random would get thrown in to die. Some person pointed out some Beatles stuff, so I went to look at it. Dad got a job as a design person at school.",Negative

The idea of it scared me because pagers are illegal at school and I thought I had left my pager on beep when I went to school that day.

I've gone down a side street - it would be near the library, at least, might be Field - so I turn right, I'm going there anyway and I keep looking out for this boyfriend, he should be along pretty soon. There's a truck of some kind there, maybe a large van, a bus, something like that, the kind of vehicle that you have to sort of climb up into. I'm up in there [I'm not sure why - maybe to wait], looking at something [that's kinda like the dashboard, although I can't say that that's what it is], and I rearrange something on it - I also am wondering if I shouldn't just go in what I've got on - somehow (this outfit) doesn't seem complete to me anymore.",Positive

I looked up in the sky and saw a meteor or comet coming closer and closer. I ran into a garage and lay on the floor of the garage. There was a mechanic and 2 or 3 other men there.

She was stopped on a patch of grass just off the road. I was sitting in the front and Ezra was in the seat behind me. A cop came to Ezra's window and knocked. Mom was hiding her stuff and then opened his window. He told us to get out because he was going to search the car. He handcuffed Mom to the car and we had to stand up against this fence. I didn't know what happened, but as we got back in the car Mom said he'd found some, but let her off with a warning. There was more in her shoe. The whole area was covered in cops.",Negative

The girl chased after him and when they stopped she jumped into his arms and it turned out they were cousins. He also did some bouncy stuff in a shop.

I went into this room, which had a desk and 'waiting' chairs. I saw this kid who looked like him. I asked if his last name was Ellis and he said yes. Then I asked him if her father was called Classmate-M-24 and he said yes.

Over and over and over again.  I started to yell at him.  My mother and Stuart were supposed to take me to class.  Stuart thought it was Saturday but I said it was Wednesday and had to get to class at 10:30.  I looked at my watch.  20 to 2.  Well, still had to get to class.  They kept lagging.  No way I'd make it.  I woke up to found the 'humming' was actually Jeremy's snoring.",Negative
"I'm painting a room, green. Some people interrupt me. They have information about the guilt of someone. They were witnesses to the burning of a Isuzu car. I leave my work to listen to them. I finally convince them to tell their story to the authorities. They won't go there in public, so I take them through a private corridor. It goes through a series of non-peopled spare bedrooms. ""The first one,"" I tell them, ""is where I go when I want privacy or quiet."" After we go through a lot of them, I point out that this used to be a mansion. We get to the door. I instruct them to put on a oxygen mask, which is clear plastic and covers both the nose and mouth. I tell them not to be afraid. This is pure oxygen. We go into a chamber. The door closes. Water fills it up. Then the door on the other side opens into a under water world. I am immediately called to finish my hostessing chores before I can bring my witnesses to the authorities' notice. I swim out to take drinks to people, etc. The witnesses are seated at a table to eat. There is some confusion about how they can eat with their masks on so they won't drown. They work it out.",Negative

We also recorded some other great rhythms. My uncle brought his special recorder and that and the mikes I had made a very good sound. More of my pals arrived and we were able to play Yellow River because one of them had the lyrics already, and later we turned on other instruments and at that moment the alarm clock rang.",Negative

She sees a boy coming to the closet to hang up his hats. This bothers her because he'll find their closet and interrupt. He goes in and is now in his own room. Three puppets are hung up on the hat rack. He's afraid of one of them because it has huge black circles for eyes and looks scary. He calls to his daddy who says there's nothing to worry about. Then the two male puppets are moving and talking. One turns to the other and wants to make love, so the other one becomes a ""female"" and they have sex. I feel orgasm.

"I am at some information booth and a woman is selling her wares. It is some new age group that sounds very good and intriguing and yet I have some doubts. Maybe they are a cult that starts invading your privacy and thoughts. I look at the children's books, a special device and some other things. I keep asking questions. I decide to buy some of the items to look at them in detail later. Now They show me an apartment I could rent, in Dover. It is a small one bedroom, with two double beds like in a motel room. A man and I are interested, but again, still unsure and hesitant. I ask the fat landlady what the rent would be she says it depends, ____ on down to 500 dollars. This sounds high to me, and the place isn't all that good a shape. but now she shows us it has a living room, a dining room and several more bedrooms. It is looking more like a good deal. The bed in the back bedroom is a narrow cot like thing. I test it and it turns out to be a flimsy hammock cloth. I ask if it is a hammock. She says no, that's not the bed. The bed would be brought in later and we'd have to sign a paper saying they removed the critters. It was some kind of an insurance scam. I don't feel good about it. She then hands me a brochure on the cheap computer they offer for sale. $13.95 and it does recipes and appointments and so on. I saw some strange contrivance in the bedroom that looked like a bathroom scale taped to a woodstove chimney that was that device. I look out the back windows to check out the neighborhood. Odd looking people, fat like a cow (and looked at first like he had an udder) and so on. We're not sure this is going to be good, but we are still interesting in finding out more.",Negative
"I was in another city, in some sort of complicated spectator-participant dream. Some teenage girls were mixing themselves a drink on a school lawn. A teacher found them and took them to the principal, who was relieved when he found they hadn't been giving any hard liquor to their young baby brother; he was afraid someone immature might have been getting it. Then someone was trying to rent an apartment down the street. The chief of police wanted to keep him out, but if he were going to pay the rent, there was no way to do so. He wanted to start some sort of a sex magazine to appeal to (how could this be?) lower class Negroes and upper class whites. He was a sort of skinny foreign guy from the South, and he had recruited a bunch of young teenage girls to work for him. They would write stories and then he would end them -- he had written lots of science fiction and fantasy magazines and had all sorts of varied science background. So the girls were arriving and were finding rooms to rent next door to the office he had rented. I was one (at the same time it was also to be a novel or movie in itself -- what would happen to these 5 young girls in the big city, and how would each of them react to confronting life in the raw in N.Y.), and I was sort of this man's press secretary or something, and I went with him to a sort of conference where Pierre Salinger also was. My first assignment was to be to buy five weird types of cars, which were very different from ordinary cars in some way, for him to use the parts for something. We were also talking about the South, and this man considered himself an expert in some way because he had lived there for a while.

"Two Richard Priors  I'm at Pool Park. A person I know from an opposing high school basketball team names Steve is there. He is tossing up baseball-like balls and hitting them with a bat. The balls are reddish-pink. One of the balls is a hard-hit grounder that I skip out of the way of as it races behind me. I give him a warning glance. There are a bunch of guys playing ball. I don't like them, especially one of them. I tell him he better watch it. I am belligerent. The guys are younger than I, maybe 16 or 17, and they are cocky. I get in a fight with one kid. He gets his friend, Cory Bark, who I know from grade school. We fight, those two against me. I beat them up. They are holding fishing poles. The rods cover their faces, so I have to punch around the rods. I go into a nearby house. I beat up six or eight black guys, one by one, as I walk around the house. I make it all the way around the house, back to wear I started. There are two Richard Priors there. I beat them up so I can get out a window. I have to go 400 miles away. The window is locked so I have to go and hit them again to give me enough time to get it open. I walk around the front of the house, which is my house. The window I was trying to get open is the one nearest the telephone in the dining room of my house. There is a black woman coming up the steps. She is the mother of one of the kids I beat up. I get the mail. We go inside. I try to use the phone to call 911 for the hurt guys, even though I don't want to. I do this because the black lady and a family friend, Anna Gates, are there.

My car was out the front of the old house (on the grass in the middle). There was a note on it left from these people who lived across the road. Dad left a note about Zalgo and the next day they put Zalgo stuff all over it (like 'he comes' etc). I went to work and Ezra was there. We finished most of it and then we started chatting and I realised I hadn't done the floors yet. I quickly got to cleaning them but the place was bigger and different and there was a small office room. Ezra left to wait for me and Isaak came out. He looked in the sink and asked if I had relatives here and I said no and then said Ezra was here for a bit. He said something about my car and the police. I ran out and there was more writing on it with 'fail' on the door. I went to some place with a bunch of people and some of them were in the group that did it.

"The story lines of me starting off a new year of school and somebody having a wedding were so closely intertwined, it was kind of hard to make sense of it all. But I think the first scene had to do with me being at Westport College and going to take a more advanced electronics class there. Well, first of all, the most clearest thing in my mind is I was with this guy who kind of acted like Andrew, and he was showing me that if you constructed this little round decorative thing out of metal, and you mount it on a sort of a metal plate, that there's holes in the metal plate that you put, that you attach a chain to. And you attach this chain and then you can chain it. And I think that he sent me to, it was Mom and I and we rode with him in this little golf cart down this path with these little ginger bready houses around it, and that was supposed to be the Westport College campus. And we came to the office of the man that I really wanted to talk to, but before he was there, we had some time to wait, so Mom and I kind of took off and we went to -- I can't remember where we went -- but I think we went to some kind of CD store or something, some place to shop, I think. And now it gets kind of fuzzy from there. But then I remember coloring some cards. They, I can't really explain what was on them, but you know how when I first look at a black and white thing, I can't tell what in the heck it is until I look at little parts of it and put it together? Well, it was like, it was in the ""I don't know what the heck it is"" stage, and I never put it together. I was trying to, but I could never make sense of them. I was just coloring all kinds of crazy colors [laugh]. And what else? [yawn] Then we were in this store and somebody was having a wedding and they were looking at tablecloths and party supplies and pink napkins, and I was thinking, ""Oh cool, if there's some pink napkins left over, I can get them and use them as pink stuffing or something.""

We walk beck up the garden shielding Reece so that he can surprise her.Back at the table we sit down. Reece sneaks in and gives his wife a kiss on the cheek. We all cheer - his wife seems surprised and a little embarrassed and in fact shows signs of not appreciating the joke.

Ezra's said ""To Tommy"" and ""from Lana Lang (Smallville)"". I asked ""who's mine from?"" and it said Oliver Queen (Smallville). I giggled, thinking I must've done it because he was the hotest, but then it was Zod (Smallville). There were also a few from Clark. Then I had a bar? When people from it, they got a green symbol above their head. This new guy was with this guy in armour who had light skill (like in Smallville yesterday) -- I don't remember what I was talking about here. I went in and some people had red symbols. I said to my friends to not drink because it was bad and I gave them mine. I tripped some person over so they would spill their drink and I gave them my drinks ""on the house"". A guy friend of mine was worried about his red symbol. Then the guy with the light wanted to kill me. A bunch of us told him to leave. We discovered he was blind. Zod stayed behind. I went back quietly and whispered to him and then hid under a desk. The light guy came looking for me. Zod attracted him somewhere else. I was copying his movements on this metal framework thing; hold and jump etc. But then he made a bit disappear and Zod fell to the ground. He got out and later ran across the restaurant and hid under a table, while the light shot at us. People at the bar were angry at me for not letting them drink. They read out from an old diary of mine. It mentioned some crush from when I was younger called ""Peter Bishop"" (Fringe). I took it off them, upset, and they realized it was wrong and were nice again.",Negative
"I'm at work, I'm not sure where, but I'm stopping off where a conversation is taking place in. I think the third floor hallway of our wing I think. There were some people, but the only person who was speaking to me at the time was, I think, one of the other counselors named M. And he said, ""You know, you don't have to be blind to learn things too"" and I said ""What did you say?"", he repeated it and I said, ""I know that.""",Negative
"It wasn't all that odd, but I wish I would quit having dreams about programs I used to mix sound. I mean, it's getting a little crazy now. [laugh] I'm not really sure which of these scenes came first, but I think this is the first one. I was -- how come I can't talk this morning? Okay, I think I'm ready. I was at this -- no, wait -- first I was at the house and my Mac machine was on the front porch. In place of the white bench there was a little table where I was sitting and working. And I was working on some part of DP all visually because the rest of my system was all upstairs, but for some reason that was there, I guess because in my dream Dad figured we could both work side by side, because he would be in the foyer and I would be out there. But the rest of my system wasn't there with it, and I was thinking, ""How in the world am I going to be able to get this back to my studio where my audio system is. Even my task scan was still up here. And just about that point I was deleting a few sound bites, and I was working on something in DP, and Margaret and Ken's mother and their family were inside. I don't know how they got there; they didn't walk past me from the front door. And I think Melinda was there too. And it was like a post-graduation. We didn't get to come to the party, so let's have the party at your house kind of party, even though in real life they did come to graduation. And so I got up from my work for a minute and head into the kitchen to go say hi and then come back and shut down. But before I knew it, I was dancing with them, I was partying with them, I was opening presents with them. And it was dark by the time the party was like in full swing, and I realized I didn't get to shut down. And Dad said, ""Don't worry, I shut down for you already."" And that was that. And then out of the group of people that was there, there was this one black girl, and her name was Arkisha, and Dad was talking on the phone to a Geico agent named Arkisha before. But this girl Arkisha was about my age and she wanted to go to Westport College with me, and she said that she had these friends that were in this Spanish band that were doing some kind of recording test in Dr. Moran's lab, and it was like they're weren't testing out the equipment. The test was on them to see how well they knew how to use the equipment. And Arkisha thought that I knew a lot and wanted me and this other boy to come and help them because they needed assistance. And so in my dream Westport College was like just a walk away, like up on 7th Street, and it was more trouble to wait for the cab than to just walk over there. So we walked over there and I was barefoot, and I had like real sloppy clothes on, and we were walking around the school. And in my dream it was neat to feel the surfaces of the floor and stuff with my bare feet. And we went into Dr. Moran's lab, and it was bigger and it had a blue floor. And there was this little area off to the side where people let bands go when they have to record, which there really isn't. It was like an enclosed glass area with a stage and a sound board. And we were in there and Dr. Moran said that I couldn't help those boys because I knew too much and that I wasn't going to be just a hand, I was going to be wanting to tell them lots of information for their test. And so I was going to go home, and so I was walking out and walking home and again, it was more trouble to wait for the cab than to just walk home because I only had to go like two blocks. And then before I got home, I kind of started waking up, and then I realized where it really was and that it really was too far to walk. And then I kind of faded into consciousness.",Negative

"Opening The Door To School  I'm in Woodland. I'm riding my red Huffy childhood bicycle holding a bag of apricots. It's the day before I am to move into the Whitman house. I have my stuff in a room on campus. I ride past the Brimson Crew Team boathouse. The house is on a lake, which is south of Brimson. I ride over the boats, which are on trailers. I see a woman jogging with a cast on her broken foot. She hops on one leg. I go past a house that is a place you can buy blue jeans. A lot of blue jeans are stacked around the sidewalk and yard. I ride past a golf coach and his high school golf team. One left-handed kid makes a long putt. I clap for him. His coach is jubilant and encouraging. The kid downplays his great putt, as if he has been struggling playing lately. I go by the Whitman house. It looks trashy because of the people that have lived there during the summer. There is a teal or dark turquoise mini van parked on the front lawn. The front lawn is smaller than usual. I go through the next yard where there is a lady with a gun. I turn around. Something happens with the lady and blueberries. I'm riding my bicycle singing an oldies song, with my bag of apricots. I drop apricots, and pick them up. As I head back to campus I wonder who will be there to talk with. There is a door leading to school. I try to open the door while still on the bicycle, and drop apricots. I pick them up and try to open the door again. I sing and try to open the door to school.",Positive
"I started a new job for a relatively small company. They had maybe 12 employees. On the first day they were having a staff meeting in a room that looks kind of like a very small cafeteria or dining room. It had the typical six-foot long tables and folding chairs. The tables were displaced randomly in the room and very close together. They weren't in rows or anything like that. When people were sitting at the tables, some of them were sitting back to back. There was very little room to move between them. I noticed how dirty the tables and the floor were. It looked like people had been having meals there and never cleaning up. The owner came in and started the meeting. He had a number of handouts. I was feeling surprised by how unorganized they were. Each of the handouts had multiple pages, but some of them had not been stapled together yet. Nobody seemed to know what anybody else was doing. They were trying to pass around the handouts, but not in one direction around the table as you might expect. They were handing them off in all different directions, causing some people to not get them. I realized at one point that I was holding a stack of identical copies when I thought I just had one copy of each handout. I realized that there was another stack there that needed to be passed around, that no one had mentioned. There are a number of things that the owner said that started getting me very concerned about being there. I started to feel like I had made a bad decision to come to work here. He was talking about the company web site. I don't know if I had seen it or if I just made this judgment based on what he was saying, but it was a very simple and what I considered ineffective web site. I didn't believe it was going to be worth the money they put into it because they didn't put enough into it. I thought I might talk to him about using Jeff K, but then realized immediately that he was not going to have the money to invest in Jeff K's fees. I had a feeling he would be much like Bill C when it came to websites. I began to think it would be best for everyone if I just resigned right away.",Negative

"Two young men playing tennis. Both fairly tall (about 5' 10""), and dressed in white. Both are better than average players. One man serves both balls in strong court -- apparently intentionally -- and then asks privilege of re-serving the second ball.

"Me and my friend Joe were in Las Vegas (we're going tomorrow for real), and I was filming a Street Dance Show, zooming in and out of piles of clothes on the street on the way into a casino.

"Me and Rudy climbed under the railroad trestle and down the hill; down a dirt path through the woods and over rocks. William, Ester and Ackerman came along. Ackerman was there without his mother, and without permission from his mother. I wanted to jump in and see where the river would take me. Nobody else wanted to swim, so I jumped in, in my clothes, and started going downstream with the current. When I'd gotten out of sight of the others, the river branched out into 3 directions. It suddenly got very deep. I was going faster and faster. I passed a good rock to grab on to, but I missed it. That was the first detour from the river. At the next fork it became unclear which one was the real river. The rocks on the side were extremely steep, and I let the current take me where it wanted to. I climbed up the tall, steep rock wall and over huge empty 50 gallon oil drums (that were) stacked up 7 or 8 barrels high. When I got to the top, I could see the others far away. I could see that the Con Edison lady was yelling at THEM because I swam down the river. I wanted them to jump into the river to get away from her. The Con Ed lady was mad about me swimming in the river, climbing over the barrels, and (climbing) over the rocks. She thought I was in too deep. She said (that) no swimming was allowed. I felt like Con Edison had no jurisdiction over the river, even if it (the river) did provide their electricity.",Negative

I walk home from the rally, which was at the Uptown Theater in Oak Valley. I'm with Ramona. Three teenagers walk by. One of them has a spray-type pellet gun. I bump into one of them. They shoot me. It doesn't really affect me much. They shoot me again. I beat the three of them up very badly. There seems to be four of them, one of whom I don't beat up. The police come to the Uptown Mall. I run and leave Ramona behind. I go over a fence and down along 3rd Street. I go through yards and porches of houses. The houses are surrounded by water. I jump, climb, and crawl from house to house on porches. Homosexuals and drug addicts occupy the houses. I get to a house that I'm familiar with. It is the Brew Ha Ha House.

"I was looking at the moon and another thing that kinda looked like a cutesie-poo sun. I was with my friend Anna L., and Rita L., her mom, but it wasn't really Anna's mom - it was someone who looked like her mom. And then Rita got transported to the moon and told the people on the moon to take a man who looked like Al L. (Anna's father) and transport him to the moon. So they went down to earth (the people on the moon) to get the person who looked like Al, but Al - or rather the person who looked like him - did not want to go. The people who came from the moon told the person who looked like Al that the person who looked like Rita said to bring him to the moon. But then the person who resembled Rita said that she never said that. But the people from the moon said they had proof because they had one of Rita's 200 earrings. And that was the end. Setting: Part of it was in a strange room, part of it was on the moon. Characters: One was my friend Anna - she is my best friend, and two people who looked like Anna's parents, Al & Rita. Anna had blonde hair and blue eyes, her hair was medium long. Rita had short brown hair - she was wearing a blue shirt with orange pants. Al was wearing jean shorts and a red flannel shirt.

"A person came into the room with a tray of cake. It seems as if it was the monitor, but I can't remember. The content of the dream just didn't seem to be present in my awake state. It was almost as if I was expecting to be awoken any minute. It's sitting right at the back of my mind what I was dreaming about, but I can't remember it now. I was driving down a highway and apparently I was driving pretty fast and the next thing I knew I was behind a policeman who looks more like a county sheriff. The location I don't know where. I sort of stopped fast and felt sure the policeman was going to stop me. At that time a Jaguar went by fast so the policeman went after him. I almost went off the side of the road because I almost ran into a small island on a turn. There was someone with me, but who it was I don't know. I don't have any idea. The content does not seem real in the sense that it is just not plausible, and I have no idea where it was at.",Negative

In fact, I think there's as many as ten every second being made."" Then I left this, during this time I was leafing through a stack of mimeographed papers of an outline of course.

The dream started off in the living room of a large mansion with four people whom I did not recognize standing looking at a package they had received in the mail. The package contained a music box inside of which was a calling card of a local undertaker. Suddenly we were aware that someone had been killed in the next room although we didn't see the body. A detective was called in to start the investigation in a typical Sherlock Holmes style. Everyone there was questioned including the undertaker who turns out to be a close friend of the family. After much thought the detective accuses the undertaker who in turn breaks down and confesses that business was so bad that he killed the person and then sent the music box as advertisement so the family would give him the business. The people in the room seemed to be my family but did not actually resemble my family in any way. The parents were about 40 years old and the daughter and son about 22. Even there was a feeling of some relationship. I still felt most of the time that I was merely a spectator.,Positive
"Ginny walks up to me. She says, ""Well, how about it? You and I have been this way for 41 years now. Are we going to admit it?"" I shake my head no and then feel embarrassed for her, because she had brought up the sensitive issue of sexual feelings and I turned her down. I smile at her gently to convey that I still like her and I won't leave her because she has brought it up.",Negative
Cory Monteith and I got married. We were at the old house but it was new. People were sleeping. It was night. We took this lounge bed out the front and we had sex. We lay on it outside. Then it was cold and I asked if we could bring it inside and we took it into the games room. As we passed the kitchen I saw that the oven light was on. I went to my room and checked my phone. I had over 30 messages and they were all from Mom and Dad. I had forgotten to take them to the wedding? I went back out to go to bed.,Positive
"I dreamed that I was roller skating on a very unusual skating floor. The floor seemed to be slanting at a slight degree towards the middle, from all sides. In the middle was a bridge and underneath it were damp wet leaves, grass, etc. I seemed to be the only one skating but there were several men standing around watching. One man was standing underneath the bridge and motioned for me to come near him. I tried to ignore him but the bridge seemed to be magnetized and I was drawn to him. He began to put his arms around me and I attempted to release his grasp. It seemed that I had no strength in my arms at all. I started to scream as I was terrified but I still had hopes that my screams would attack the other men's attention & they would come to my rescue. The other men just looked at me, ignored my screams, and walked away. Interpretation None Answers to questions 2. I was terrified3. actual participant4. unpleasant5. The setting was on a strange roller skating floor.6. no7. The only color I was conscious of was the color of the man's hair, which was a deep auburn.",Negative
A girl came in from the next room from me and woke up my roommate asking her what time it was. Irma said it was quarter after 6 and Barb called her a liar and insisted that it was 6:30. Irma got quite huffy and they started quarreling. Barb slammed the door and stormed into her room. This woke me up. I was very angry at being awakened from a sound sleep in such a rude way. This dream seemed so real that I was actually surprised to find out that it really never happened.,Negative
"I have a room full of people, a class or something. One of my students is a good-looking young man but he's a quad and he hates it. He has a bad attitude. He' withdrawn and hostile. Some girls come in, selling used books for $2.00. I buy one for him with his money. Then I buy one for me because it's such a bargain. I get too much change and quietly keep it. I have some guilt. It's Mexican pesos. I tell him that she liked him. She had smiled at him. He gets very angry! ""Don't tell me that!"" I grab his shoulders and shake him and pull him up so he has to look at me and say, ""It's your attitude that's paralyzed, the disability is not the problem.""",Negative
"I am swimming with a woman. It is quite dark and I can't see well. We start wading out over dark brown sand, look down at pools. It is a long ways until it is deep enough to swim. Then I plunge in as she says, ""But I can't stay long."" We get out and start off and I've left my red flowered suit. I will have to phone or go back after it. Can't think how I could have left it behind for we had ridden down in her car already in bathing suits because I no longer belong to beach club and where could I have changed? I reluctantly decide I had better walk back after it today. Well I won't really have to. This is only a dream.",Positive

"My exams had ended, and I was worried about the results because I was not sure I had answered well.

"I was at the large home of a patrician couple maybe 10 years older than me.  They were so similar to the Spears that I asked them if they knew the Spears.  They said they didn't, and I felt foolish about having asked.  Why would they, just because they are similar?  The woman made some coquettish remarks-something like how handsome I was-and her husband just grunted.  I didn't know if she was being playful or whether there was serious intent behind it.  Clouds started to gather and darken outside, it looked like there was going to be a serious storm.  I saw ragged wisps of cloud hanging down along the edges of the clouds, and I went out to see if there was going to be a tornado.  As soon as I looked out the door I saw a funnel not far from the house-a narrow one.  I ran inside and told the couple that there wasn't time to go to the basement-just to get under something.  The wife lay down in the kitchen, the husband lay under a table in the living room, and I lay near him with my hands over my head.  Fortunately, the tornado missed us.",Negative
"I was staying at the BE Retreat Center. We were having our retreat for the end of SDI. Sister Toni was my spiritual director. We were having a special Mass at the end. We were given very specific instructions not to come I the main door and no other. There was a door that many people used frequently during other occasions but they wanted to make sure we did not use that entry for this occasion. I guess I forgot because I am came in that door anyway. It was 5:45 and the Mass was to begin at 6. I had my sewing machine with me. When I got down there actually I think I had either forgotten about the whole thing or didn't realize what time it was. When I arrived in the chapel I saw everyone there and all dressed up and realized what was going on. I went over to the entrance where we were supposed to come in. They said something to me about coming in the wrong door and also about having my sewing machine with me. I didn't want to admit that I had forgotten about the whole thing or not realized what time it was, I was thinking of saying, At least I'm on time. But I don't think I said it. They told me I had to get rid of my sewing machine quickly and that I had better be back on time. I went outside to take the machine to my car. It was a long walk and up a steep hill. You couldn't even see the parking lot from where I was. I started walking up the sidewalk on this hill. The machine was so heavy that it was slowing me down. I thought it would be faster if I sat the machine on the floor and pushed it up the hill. As I was doing this, bobbins kept falling off into the grass along the sidewalk. I had to keep stopping to pick them up - gather them up. People were watching me. When I got to the top of the hill I saw a big cement area set up with folding chairs. There were people arriving and taking their seats there. This area was for people attending the Mass that couldn't get a seat in the chapel, because the chapel was too small for everyone. They had a large screen TV or something like that set up for the people sitting out here to watch what was going on inside. Now it seems that I had gone outside and up this hill to get back to my room rather than to my car. I went to the wall that people were facing to go into the building. I grabbed a door that I wasn't even sure it was a door or an entry. I had to get down on my hands and knees again. Then I saw that it did go into where I wanted to be. It was a small square opening. I crawled in and then stood up. It looked like a narrow hallway straight in front of me. At the end of that hallway I had to either go left or right onto another hallway. Along that hallway was a bunch of sets of double doors. I entered one set of these double doors and Sister Toni was in there waiting for me for a session. We had our session. Elvis Presley was at a restaurant. He was having a meal and I think he had been drinking because he was very upset about something that had happened. There are some people with him that are only about 6-12 inches tall. They are living people. Myself and someone else decided to offer to take him back to the BE Retreat Center to try to hide him from the public so they wouldn't know what was going on but also to help him. We took him back there and gave him a room. At some point I ended up going back to the chapel. I had one or two flights of steps to go down to get there. They were very wide, wide enough for maybe 12 people and they were painted a dark green. They had a banister that looked like a steel pipe, but also painted green. I was really rushing to get to the chapel on time. I could tell Mass was starting because I heard the music. I decided it would be faster if I floated down the steps rather than taking each step. So I somehow lifted myself off of the floor, leaned slightly back and to my left side and then floated or flew down the steps. When I got to the bottom of the steps I went around the corner and saw the entrance to the chapel. Someone is standing there waiting for me. She is wearing black slacks and a white blouse, corsage and name tag. She has a name tag for me. She said something about me getting there when I did.",Negative
"We're in like a little card room eating a deep dish pizza (my favorite). The room is totally green except for one brown table. All of a sudden I was in New York walking down 5th Ave. with my mom. She put me on a bench and told me something like, ""Stay here and watch out."" She told me she was going to go get a pizza from my favorite pizza place in New York. So I waited. Wow, now that I think back, I was standing up the whole time because there was no benches available. Anyway, so I finally see a bench and there is a man sitting there. I sit down and he gets so hyper and is jumping everywhere, he says my name and then I somehow knew it was an uncle I don't usually see who we talked a lot about at dinner last night. So we were so happy. Then my mom arrived and said, ""Uncle B.!"" then I don't remember anything else. Setting: In a green room, and in New York, my favorite place. I always want to go. It was on 5th Ave. near a bench. Characters: My mom, my sister, and my uncle who I never see (and over dinner last night we talked a lot about him). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, relaxed, bored. I was pretty relaxed, but happy that I was going to get my favorite pizza from my favorite place in New York, but I was bored while I was waiting, too. The weird thing is my uncle.

"In this dream I remember hearing the news that my mother had died. I remember feeling very upset at the news. I don't know who told me the news, but soon after I heard it, the telephone rang and I heard my father's voice. He called to tell me about my mother. When he spoke to me, I felt very sorry for him and suddenly pitied him because he would be alone. When he spoke of my mother, I thought of her and at this point had an intense emotional outburst of tears. Later I remember sensing a fear and read of going to my mother's funeral. I did not wish to see her dead. I then visualized my mother's face before me with her eyes closed. It was very vivid.",Negative
"Dad and Mom and I were on a trip and he was telling me things.

But he was telling all these horror stories as to what could happen in an elevator, and how you could like fall ten stories. I was really nervous when we got on the elevator and went down to the ground floor, but we did. And then he wanted me to ride around the perimeter of this garden. First there was a little place where people could go in with a fan blowing out of it, then there was a little pool, then there was the air conditioner and then there was the other side opposite the house. I went around everything he said, but I didn't go past the air conditioner. So I don't remember anything more.",Negative

"The characters involved were my mother, father, _____ 16 or 17 year old brother Dave. It was an unusual dream. The feeling of communicating with my parents was distinctly important. It's sort of difficult to accurately describe the setting situation as far as feeling of the dream, one dream as being taken, no dream was taking place. The basic idea of the dream was I was traveling from someplace to home and when I got home, I was to clean something. There was a chore that was expected of me to do. The whole base of the dream was my coming from one point to home. The dream seemed to be more in the tense of the past. It just didn't have the characteristics of a present. My father particularly. In the past, well, it just seemed different. The house seemed to be across from our house where we lived in New Jersey. Very good friends of my mother and father lived there, and this seemed to be the house we were occupying. This dream seems to be fouled up by the same sort of feeling and situation of the first dream recorded tonight of a light plane landing, myself sitting, watching it. It seemed to be completely different from the dream about my folks. There seemed to be no relationship between the two. It was just as if one was cut off, and the next thing this one starts, but the bit with the plane wasn't as if a story or something. It was just this plane was landing and that was all there was to it. This was to be the end anyway. The __________ referred to was known to me before reaching home and this was going thru my mind as I was traveling to my destination, and there was hardly any conversation between myself and my folks, just a salutation upon arrival and exchange of words. This was the extent of the dream.",Negative
"I am the Devil, and I'm scheduled to appear in a musical. Everybody else thinks I'm a mere mortal *playing* the Devil, but I know better. I show up at the right time. The musical begins; everything is very Babylonian. There is an enormous man in the middle of the room, wearing a turban and sitting on a throne. The jungle drums begins. He throws his arms up and shakes as the chorus sings: ""Seven hundred twenty eight pounds/six hundred of them fat!"" Now, it is his part in the musical to jump on me, and then I was to pretend to kill him with the fake weaponry. But since I am the Devil, after all, unmitigated evil incarnate, I opt for hacking him to pieces with my axe for real when he lands on me. The audience marvels at the special effects as I walk off the stage, leaving the dismembered fat man stewing and quivering in his own blood.",Negative

"In the beginning of this dream I was in the back of a large, open truck with a bunch of other boys. It seems that we were going back to school. I cannot remember what we were talking about. We stopped at the edge of a small town and everyone was getting out to go swimming. I threw down the helmet to my skin diving wet suit and said, ""Five dollars."" Immediately a boy took it and gave me the $5, which was for renting it). The place we swam at was much like a place we used to go to in Colorado when I was in summer camp. It was a gorge full of deep pools and a lot of fast-moving water. The boy I rented the helmet to was in the place I wanted to go but it was so small, only I could fit. Finally he moved out and I got in. I had my mask on so I was doing some diving. I remember thinking I could really earn a lot if I rented out my whole suit. The dream becomes hazy now, but I do remember something about a red and white '57 Ford going up the road. It had a N.Y. plate on it.",Negative
"(04/01/97)[""Observing life as a couple.""] I am struggling hard to walk on a steep embankment. I am concerned that I did not choose the right way to go. The soil is sandy and it keeps sliding under foot, making walking very difficult. I see that if I slip and fall, I will land in a dirty water area. That would be bad. I look up to see if it would be better to walk on the high ridge of the bank. No, that isn't good either. So I continue walking. Suddenly I see that I have made it. I walk into a city area. Right in front of me is a road. On the right it is a deep canyon and on the left, it is flat and a regular street. So I turn left and walk down the street. I look at the shop doors. I am looking for something, but all I see is a mission and a post office. Now, I am transported into a domestic scene. I am seated on a couch watching a couple as they manage their daily routines. Four or five cats, half grown kittens, gray and white spotted ones, hop around me playfully. I go into the kitchen and watch the couple. I am very aware that I live my life as a single person. This is what it is like when you live as a couple. I feel envious about their happiness at being together.",Negative

We went into the other room and there also was mass. We walked thru outside and there were what I think were ex-jockeys and gamblers and horse trainers. This man introduced me to these fellows. I got up and shook hands with a colored man who seemed to be a trainer or stable boy. Then I sat down again and over went the seats with us. We lay there for a while. Then I got up and went over to another seat and the man introduced me to another fellow. His first name was Steve. I said mine was John. I said I maybe would play Steve and he said no, the same jockeys are going to win next week also. Then this one I can't recall is now not winning will be on the winning streak.

Like, a lot of them were just general what they should be filling in but some were very specific. So on some of them I was telling them a specific name to check or fill in. One of the items I didn't know what it was. It was a very strange word. It sounded something like, Imagonnagohome! So I was standing on this stage with a microphone. I was joking about it. When I first got started, the microphone that I was supposed to use wasn't working. Then I was supposed to be standing in front of the stage using this microphone. That microphone wasn't working so they brought me around and up on stage and gave me a different microphone. I was using that one and we were still having problems. I was making jokes to try to make light of the technical problems we were having. It was mostly men that I was working with. It seemed that I was observing these children of this wealthy man. He didn't have time for his children, so they were not well behaved. They were spoiled because he spent lots of money on them instead of spending time with them. They were going to play bride and groom. The young girl, she was very large and well developed for her age, was half-dresses in her wedding outfit. She kept yelling at the little boy to bring her dress. He wouldn't do it. Then I'm back at the event. I was going to lay down and watch the rest of it. This little girl is upset so she asks if she can lay there with me. I told her that she could. She or I one grab a pillow.

"I just woke up from a very strange dream. One of the strangest that I've ever had in my life I think. We were somewhere, like part of my mind says it was part of the grounds of the Redwood school and something else says we were somewhere visiting. I guess there was a great many people around and there was seemed like there were lots of activities around everywhere. And the animals, there were a lot of animals around, like there was a circus there. And the elephant was there of course being at a circus, and we had to walk through the feeding area of this elephant and they were saying ""That's all right, you can wash off your shoes because the area was...they said that the elephants were eating something like butter, or mashed potatoes and gravy...But you knew while you were walking that you were walking in this really slippery kind of stuff that was a type of thing that you just knew that you had to get your shoes cleaned and they said, ""don't worry about it"" and we walked for quite a while in this mess and when we came out of it I heard the elephant making that sound, that trumpeting. It didn't seem to bother anybody, it was just there and there was a lot of activity around and it seemed like there was music in the background and everything but I guess the strangest thing about the dream was where we had to walk and it was almost as if we had to walk through some of the waste materials too that the elephant would leave.",Negative
"I am downtown in my town collecting news. I talk to a priest, then stop at a store. A clerk is crying about a death, apparently of a child in a van. There was something defective in the van and the child died. The child belonged to a woman who was going to be married. Something about the grandmother being difficult. The clerk says she doesn't know how the couple can get married now. I pick up the obituary and am anxious to get back to the office and read it. The office is in my hometown - not my town now - and the office is an alley. I am going down the alley and am now in a red truck. I scrape a gas truck which is parked on my left. It begins to move and passes through a garage. I park my truck and check the scrape. I didn't make much noise but there is a huge scrape on the right front fender of the red truck. I am anxious to eat a lunch I bought at a restaurant in my town but I hear a noise and I know the runaway truck has hit someone. I see a man and tell him I hit the truck but it wasn't in park. I think about telling him the truck was already moving and hit me but I figure they can tell by the scrape on my truck who hit who first.",Negative
"I was looking up. I saw something flying high up. Then I saw a dog come down. It landed on the ground and it floated up about six feet off the ground. I got hold of it and inside the glass I saw a bug. It was alive, crawling around. Then there was a horse's head with one eye. It had a frightened look. The other crossed. I then saw a bright spot on the left palm of my hand. The bug seemed to have gotten out of the glass and drove itself into my hand. I pressed it and puss came out and I could see one foot of the bug sticking out. I pressed it again and it wouldn't come out. One fellow said the horse was blind, but he would win.",Negative
"I was going somewhere on a streetcar. After I had been riding a while, a Negro friend of mine (M-25) got on the car and sat down beside me. We were talking about a class we had taken together. Then a tall, fat white man--a stranger about 50--came over and pointed a gun at my friend and forced him to get off the streetcar. The white man said it made him sick to see a negro talking to a white person. Then, as my friend was walking across the street, the man shot him in the back. I got off the car and ran over to him, but he was dead. I felt sad and I cried. Interpretation None Answers to questions 2.

"I was part of some sort of search or task.  We had to bury something in a correct spot, somehow related to school.  We searched at the park near my parents' house.  The family of one of my old elementary school friends the Addisons were flying a kite. And somehow got the kite untangled from being wrapped around the trees.  They were master kite flyers.  At home, we hurried, trying to find the right item to bury.  It was hidden in a tangerine. My dad and I looked through them, trying to determine which was the right one.  We thought we found it, but kept looking to make sure.  My mother was on the phone, but pointed out the correct one.  It was slightly larger and 'bloody'.  We took it to a field where some construction work was going on.  We checked the work area- no, that wasn't the spot.  We were about to leave, and then we saw a table like the one in our bedroom near the construction zone- perhaps there for their lunches.    The grass looked different beneath.  This was the spot.  We didn't move the table but for some reason dug through it.  The shovel tip was sharp and pierced through.  We buried the tangerine.",Negative
"Dream took place in the registrar's office. I was trying to see what they could do for me because I broke my glasses. The people in the office were very unsympathetic to me.

"I dreamt in black and white again. The dream was less vague than others. I was talking on the radio, my transmitter and was experimenting with it and the antenna. I was talking with two friends with whom I had talked yesterday on the radio and had made experiments with them. In short, the events of the previous night were repeated in my dream. I was a little bit afraid, I think, because I didn't want to spoil my radio set. Then I started to try to communicate with another friend with whom I had not spoken last night, and I had a great desire to speak with him, but couldn't. I think I dreamt this because of my intense desire to hear him. I became quite agitated in a given moment in my dream. All this took place in my room, which is also my radio room.",Negative
I set an alarm clock on a small round table and set the alarm. The clock started to run around on the table. I stopped it and pressed it a little and it started to run backwards.

"In this dream I was informed by a doctor and different other people that I was going to die, but no one seemed to know just why or how much longer I would live. Throughout the dream I was more upset because of the uncertainty of the disease than the thought of dying, and I was frantically questioning different individuals for the name of my fated illness. Most of the participants of the dream were rather vague, unidentifiable figures, even the doctor. I do remember my mother's presence though, but oddly enough she was not too upset about the whole thing; she did, however, try to obtain the cause for my imminent death. Supposedly blisters would appear around my eyes shortly before the end. The whole thing seemed rather inconceivable to me even in the dream. I couldn't believe that there was anything wrong with me, but I was still very disturbed by it all.",Negative

"There is a man who trains dogs, and he doesn't have to train them to have them obey him.  To prove it, he calls Rover (our dog).  Rover runs to the door, stands on his hind legs, and with a flick of his paws, opens it.  He then goes out into the yard, which is flooded.  At this point, the dog is no bigger than my hand.  Still following the man, he has to kind of hop to get himself through the water.  Once, he goes under and I lift him up.  The next time he goes under, I can't find him, but I see a hole about the size of my little finger.  The man says ""Well, that sometimes happens.""  The hole gets to be about twice as big as my mouth, and I try to suck him out, to no avail.  Strangely, I don't feel very sorry.  The next one is a roach, which I don't like at all, and I am glad to see the man kick it down the hall, only to have grandpa save it with his knife handle a couple of times.",Negative
"I think I had been traveling in Europe and have returned. I am now on a country road, looking for a small town I used to live in. I pass the town and end up in some other small town.

"I'm at a DSA event. I think it was supposed to start at 5:00 but it's dark and I wonder if I'll even be awake by the time the thing is over. I remember flags, a state flag, for example, and I think it was something of a military game. I go over to what I think now is a water well. What happens there, I don't remember, but I like it. Then, I'm walking around a house or building and become lucid. I try to think logically and quiz myself, which increases my awareness and consciousness. Then, I tell myself to do an addition problem like 17 + 28 and I feel fully capable of doing the problem although I don't want to take the time to figure it out. I see writing on the walls, which doesn't make much sense. The individual words make sense but I can't make out the sentences. Then, I remember a sign that said ""Metal Still"" or something of the sort, and I wanted myself to remember it when I woke up. I see the well I was at earlier near the back of the house. I think this is the house where the three girls from the previous dream are living. I look for an entrance but I can't find it.",Positive
"I was in some kind of grassy, open space. I felt like it was near my school, but I kind of felt like it was in my old apartment complex from Weir (?) Park and I was sitting there on a picnic blanket with a boyfriend that I had. I'm not sure who it was. It could have been Sean or Justin, or it could have been a younger version of Jim. And he was talking about Andrea Bocelli and how he had apparently started a charity and he was helping manage Andrea Bocelli's charity. And he was putting all kind of money in it, all kinds of jobs and donations and stuff. And we started talking about getting a drink of water, and Jill comes by and she's talking to us a little bit about different things about school, and then this boy says, ""I'm going to go in and get some water. I'm going to get some ice from the ice box in your refrigerator, okay?"" And I say, ""Okay, that's fine,"" and Jill goes, ""Oh no, I took a lot of time to fill up that ice tray, and I just don't feel it's right for somebody else to go in and get my ice."" And they kind of argued a little about it, and in the end it turned out that he was going to take some of the Andrea Bocelli money to go buy his own ice. And then I woke up.",Positive

"I dreamed that I was back in 8th grade and had to make a poster about the solar system. So I made it and brought it into school. The presentations were held in the lunchroom. The presentations started and I realized how inadequate my work was. So I shifted my posters around until I found the best one I had made about the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. I used that and presented, and did very well. Then I had some dream about Jackson, that I was talking to him through a wall. I also dreamed I woke up next to him. Then I woke up.",Positive
"I was taking an exam, sort of high-schoolish. Teacher was going over the questions first and everyone had an opportunity to look up answers in their books, but I couldn't find the right books and anyplace to sit; no paper, etc. Something to do with Alaska, also, and how you would get back to the U.S. through Canada, no roads N-S, only a long river that sparkled on the map, a tiny Eskimo propelled canoe through it. Everyone else was through with the exam and left; at last I had a seat, but they were painting the room and moving everything around and there was a lot of noise, so I went outside, hoping that my former geology lab instructor would follow me. He didn't; I went inside and found that this Negro painter had painted my pocketbook dark brown like the walls; I was sure he had done it on purpose (out of stupidity rather than any particular malice) and told him to take all the paint off with paint remover.",Negative

But when he was about 30 feet above the ground, the box fell because one side had not been attached. My sister was not injured. The middle-aged man said he would send the plane up again, but I would have to pilot it, because the younger man was gone. I was apprehensive because I did not understand some of the dials.

"I am at a spiritual meeting of some kind with Lydia and her family, Valerie and her family, and others. A man is talking, he is the leader. I want to see a book on the Jones Town Massacre. I see many pictures in the book that are graphic and hard to look at, but it is important to look at them. I then realize that Lydia and Valerie are too easily susceptible and will believe in this man and that will be dangerous for them. I try to get us to move away from the crowd and away from the leader. There is a hypnotic quality to his delivery and it is hard to pull away. Now we have gone up a mountain and are at a spiritual retreat. Again, I feel the hypnotic pull and try to resist. They have a new recruit that has volunteered to be the gate. Her name is Joy and she just graduated from high school and is 18 years old. She is very naive and innocent. Someone says they would hate to use the joy gate, because ""Can you imagine what it would be like to rip open the gate from the mountain and it's a person named Joy?"" I see rocks falling as an image of this gate opens. I must leave, and I get in my van with Dwight and I drive, trying to escape the mountain. As I drive, I see that the road curves up ahead and I force the van off the paved road and drive across the field, where a barely noticeable dirt trail is. It was hard to leave the paved road. I turn and look back and see a steam vent gush on the mountain near the small collection of buildings that is the spiritual retreat community. I wonder if it is blowing up. I turn back and keep going noticing that the trail is gone and the grass is wet and muddy and we could get stuck. I push on anyway. Now, I am pedaling a bicycle, with Dwight riding on the back. We turn to the right and go past some construction. The road is muddy. We then go down a steep hill and are on the water's edge, through a lot of muddy puddles. I wonder if I'm even going the right way, or if I shall have to turn back and backtrack. Wasted time and energy. Then, I want Dwight to help pedal. I see a police car directing the detour traffic ahead and I go toward them to ask for directions. I hear a Frank Sinatra tune being sung, ""My Girl. Is she blind, is she thin, does she wear stars on her dress? No.""",Negative
"I am in Derek's house and it is dream group time. I see a woman standing with her back to me and I say, ""Hi, Lisa."" She turns and it isn't Lisa. I feel embarrassed, especially since that might make Derek know I was thinking about him and Lisa. Derek decides to go to the grocery store. Then an overweight man sits on the couch and I sit next to him and then Eric comes and sits on my right. It's very cozy. I am explaining to them what we did at the last meeting that they had missed. I am telling them and then I ask for my notes. Derek is back and he hands me my note pad. I open it and laugh realizing that I thought I'd written words but I had only drawn pictures to remind me. That's not going to help the people who weren't there. Then I pick up another note pad and see writing. I try to read it, but I see I've only written a few words or phrases to remind me. One says, ""Three strikes and you're out,"" then a space and then two other words, ""jerk"" and another word. I say to the overweight man, ""I can't remember what this was about."" Derek comes up to me with a silly grin on his face and I say, ""What's with the Kirk Douglas grin?"" I then look over next to him on his right and see the real Kirk Douglas. Derek had met him in the grocery store and brought him home to meet us. Kirk is interested in me and is flirting. Derek is a little jealous of that and of how I let those two men sit so close to me on the couch.",Negative
"I remember dreaming of some of the stuff that happened to me while I was in the hospital recently. I dreamed of the tubes that were down my throat for breathing. I remember the tubes vividly, I believe they were made out of plastic and I remember it being taped to the side of my face. I couldn't yell and I couldn't talk I couldn't really do anything. My left arm had a restraint strap on so I wouldn't pull the tube out. I also dreamed that they took the strap off and they left it off for about 2 days I guess and finally I did pull the tube out myself and the funny part was that they did leave the restraint off and as I awoke, I did pull the tube out. The dreams that I've had lately are mostly about my time in the hospital.",Negative

"I dreamed one of my women friends had a friend who sexually assaulted young children or something of the sort. We were discussing whether we should let this friend come near our children. As we talked, I could see, on this large green meadow, several as if reconstructions of times this person had actually been with our children. I could also see, near the meadow, a long row of motels where this person had stayed, a different one on each occasion. There was also some importance to the number five, as if he stayed in room 5 or in every fifth motel or something. The dream gradually became more and more nightmarish, not in a scary sense, but that something was quite disturbing about all of these, a sort of feverishness. Finally I woke up, very gradually  and still haunted by the vision of this meadow and motels. At last I realized that I had been bitten several times around the arms and back and neck by a flea and that this was bothering me. I went into the bathroom and turned on the light to see the bites and to maybe find the flea. I saw that I had been bitten five times.",Negative

I walk to the front to challenge him. ""Is there any proof of his powers?"", I ask. ""Yes"", the young man answers, and he waves about a copy of a hard-cover book written by himself with a photograph of himself on the cover.

"This is the first dream of the year 2002. I dreamt that I was at the radio station -- no, first I dreamt that something funky was going on with our amplifier, and Dad was going to get another one to have on reserve in case ours doesn't work.

And I'm waiting and waiting for us to go and Dad's on the computer and watching TV and talking to John and doing stuff and getting computer games, and we haven't been yet. And then I woke up from that one and I kind of drifted into another dream that we were driving around town up by Penelus (?) Park and Mom was scared to carry a two-way radio to keep in touch with me. I don't why, probably because I was, or I used to be, well, I used to be. I dreamt that I was at the radio station for my first day my title would be ""teletist"" -- and it looks a lot like my bedroom, and I was sitting down talking to either Katelyn or Lydia or somebody, and then I realized I was naked. And so I closed myself in my closet and I got some clothes on and then I came out and started doing some things.

I've been invited to come for free by Jon, who's instrumental in getting this thing put on, he may have even written some of it. I've come up the hall to where the door is, and I say hi to Jon, who's also just come up and is waiting for his wife, to bring some things. She comes up with this huge load of stuff, even a bouquet of roses sticking up over her face. I make some joke about her having to carry all this stuff, but nobody notices. The roses are to go right here at the entrance. Another person I know, Rory, comes up (I haven't seen her in a long time and she sure looks different) and we all exchange greetings. Jon offers us each a rose (he's all dressed up in a tux, by the way) and as I take it I realize it isn't real, it's wax or something. They do smell, and I put it to my nose and then for a laugh I take a bite of it. I'm not really sure quite what it's made of, after all. It tastes almost as if it were meant to be eaten. I believe I'll take another bite, but I'll wait till Paula can't see me so she won't think I don't care about my pretty rose. So Rory and I go on inside. There doesn't seem to be anyone taking tickets even if we had any, but we wanted to make sure. This is certainly is a tiny place, probably 20 people across by maybe 15 down, tops. Behind the rows is a little gift shop, I guess for the whole building, not just the theater. Rory looks at some stuff there and I look at something just outside its entrance. Someone does come to take tickets, I guess he just stepped out. I wonder if we'll have to explain we've been invited for free.",Positive

Police came down the road. Mom waited without indicating. When the cops were gone she went to the guys and bought some. It was like marijuana or something. I was then somewhere else and I had a list of stuff to watch or listen to. It mentioned Michael Palin's Himalaya's and Electric Light Orchestra and comparing it to some new stuff I'd never heard of. There was something about Blue Oyster Cult, but it wasn't actually them. I was then at a shop and got some noodles. It had 'stirfry' and had these yuck carrot bits.

I never really made it out the window because I realized I couldn't get there. And the toilets really stunk in the bathroom. And then I can't remember what else.

So she proceeds to do so. Once she's finished, I turn around and see she's metamorphosed into Laura. I hand her a copy of ""V."" by Thomas Pynchon.  ""This is a good book,"" I say. The telephone rings. I pick it up and say a lot of things in French in a gravelly voice. Finally Eric says: ""David? Is that you? I knew it was you. Where are you, dude?""  ""I was about to go down the coast, but it's been an hour and a half since Jimmy said he'd take me!""  ""Right,"" says Jimmy, pulling on his pants. I remember it's storming outside, and that all this had something to do with Rhonda (female friend from highschool).",Negative
"I was supervising something like Kathmandu at night. I had 12 people or so on the job, but when I arrived I realised I had only 2 guns and I hadn't charged them (or the ones I'd left at home). Esther turned up with 6 guns or so but I was panicking. I got some people started scanning in the back room and went to get the files on the laptop. When I went to check on people, everyone without a gun had been sent home. Hugo turned up at one point to see if we needed help but I said we didn't have any extra guns anyway.",Negative
"(02/19/01)[""Spider woman ritual.""] I apparently have a Mexican father named Jamisma and a Native American mother. I am accused to stealing a special bridal dress of a native American woman. I say I am innocent. They are very angry at me. Now my ""father"" shows me a large silver broach filigree work and a center turquoise stone. Caught under that broach is a huge spider. My ""father"" is afraid to touch it or let it crawl on him. I am too. I watch it closely when it moves, afraid it will come at me. After a long time doing that, my ""father"" then allows it to crawl on his shoulder. He says the spider is mostly dead now. Maybe completely dead. He asks me where we should put it. I say put it in the garbage can. If it is alive, it can feed on the food there and survive. He agrees, He thinks of piercing it's center colored spot on the belly to put it out of its misery. But if it has a chance to live, he agrees to let it try. He takes it out. I then go into a room. The ritual ceremony is about to begin. My ""mother"" begins it. She moves around me, talking. There is some large cannon shaped object that my ""father"" positions and fires off. A lot of stuff floats down from the shot. It is positioned several times and fired. I am concerned the spider will return. Now the angry Native American girl glares at me and demands I return the bridal dress for her ceremony. I look at her and say empathetically ""I understand."" But I can't return it. I didn't take it. Apparently there was some accident that happened to it, and that may have happened because of me. But the girl wants retribution.",Negative

We were watching people awhile--even terrorists and people up to no good (drug deals) and of some very knobbly trees and the way the background, the fruits looked stacked up--like grapes at the fruit stand. Then Nancy from the NY Times was pointing out photo opportunities--the rolls and rolls of RC paper with the column count and derogatory description about Uncle Bob's letters to the NY Times columns ??? A guy was there I liked and I couldn't keep my thoughts straight to count the columns and measure the depth. There was a place on the hill I had been and another girl was there now and Nancy said this was the best picture and to wait and watch the girl.

Dora closed the window because the people's feet were making noises shuffling. Lots of people walking under the window and they were making excuses...it had been a mixed-up and misunderstood group death of a family and Dora said her bank had taken out a little money at a time--$5.00 to insure her for the strong likelihood that this family would not stick around to pay her for her counseling services. She wasn't mad, she had just had enough. A knock came at the door. The first time I ignored it and acted like I didn't hear it because I got so little time with Dora. I didn't want any distractions. But later the knock came again and a little voice said, ""It's Sue. Susanne from Miss Wilson's up the street."" Her voice sounded shaky and I was worried about her so I went to the door and apologized for not answering sooner. But later the knock came again.",Negative

"Not Shooting Randy Menders  I'm at the Redding farm. I shoot a squirrel with a BB gun that I have. The gun isn't powerful enough to kill the squirrel. I pump the gun a lot and shoot, knocking the squirrel several feet in the air, but not killing it. I'm aiming the gun at Randy Menders, my classmate at Brimson, and I fire once or twice. The shots are very weak. I'd have to fire many many times to kill him. I don't have the heart to kill him: I can't bring myself to do it. Two dead children are lying in the grass between the chicken coop and the plum trees. I look at the kids. They look dead, and have been shot, by me, I think. The kids look like animals of some sort, and seem to be half alive, still breathing a little bit. There is an older woman who is in charge of things. She speaks to me and another person about what to do with the two dead kids. She says we have to keep one of the kids out, maybe because someone like his parents are coming to see him. So we have to give the kid orange juice, since the ascorbic acid in it will prevent oxidation and decay, and we have to pick the feces out of his anus, since a dead person's bowels relax.",Negative
"I'm at a restaurant. Matthew was working there. I know they serve pizza. I was back in the kitchen area talking to Matthew. The owner was back there also. I watched him cut a pizza to take out to a customer. I'm having a conversation with Matthew about something that he sold at school like he was selling it for a fund-raiser. He had taken orders. I think it was food items. He had taken orders but now he was having trouble collecting from people. I was concerned that he was going to have to come up with the money himself and then be stuck with this food. He showed me the money that he had collected and gave me the list of what he had sold and who he needed to collect from. We were checking off what he had gotten paid for. There was some confusion. He showed me a check for $56 and told me who it was from so I checked it off. Then later he said, Oh no. That wasn't from them. It was from someone else. I corrected my notes. As we were talking, because I was concerned that he was just going to have to come up with the money. He said, No. I don't have to. If they don't come through the company just takes the stuff back. But the man that was supplying this food was really upset because he wasn't being successful at collecting this money and he was really unhappy about having to take this stuff back. I could tell the owner of the pizza place was getting aggravated with us for trying to resolve this then. Someone brought another pizza out of the oven, so I cut it myself so it could be taken out. Matthew said he was just going to leave work, that he needed to go take care of this. I told him he wasn't. He said there was nothing else that he could do. I told him that there was. I told him that he was hired to do a job, to be here when he needs you to be here, to help him run his business and that's exactly what you will do. Well have to take care of this another time. I think Allison P was working there also. I think her and I were talking for a little while. I don't know where Matthew went or what the owner was doing. But Matthew and I were talking a little bit. She was talking about some TV show and these two stars on this show and what they were doing. I had no clue what she was talking about and was just pretending to know.",Negative

I can't read the next few sentences, it seems like she asked me if I needed something that sort of looks like 'coins' and I said something that looks like ""said I inks"" and something about movies.

"I was in the chorus of an opera, behind a big brick wall, blocked from the view of the audience.  Our librettos were in enormous books that were almost too big to hold, and certainly too big to hold open.  It kept shutting and losing my place, and I was totally dependent on it-I didn't know the words or the music.  Everyone else was having trouble too-at one point Helen Martin was the only one of us to come in, and she sang a strong solo.  Later we emerged from behind the wall.  John Payne and Lois were in it too.  At one point I was naked and scrambling up an embankment or something to another part of the set.  I was the only one naked, and the script didn't call for it.  I was very embarrassed and was sure that some of the audience and even of the cast would be offended.  I didn't know why I didn't have clothes on.  After the performance was over (and it strung out much too long because of lapses, etc., and was a real bust), I was walking along a corridor of dressing rooms in a rather decrepit basement.  I passed two blacks, one of whom was taunting the other.  He then challenged me.  I kept on walking and told him to fight the other guy if he wanted to fight.

"Some lady about 60, with glasses, told me that some boy had killed a man who was evidently her husband.  However, the man was definitely my father, and the killing seems to have taken place four years earlier (as I found out later), when the boy was 14.  She told me to find him and kill him.  For this job I had a dagger with a 5- or 6-inch blade.  I watched for this boy mostly from the house, but ventured outside sometimes.  There was a sort of wooded area across from the house.  I felt sure that the killer was in the immediate vicinity, but I was still looking for a 14-year-old boy.  Pretty soon a fat gypsy came around the corner and told me he had seen a couple of boys running toward the woods.  I set out for the woods, wondering how I would go about such a task as killing a person.  I thought I would ask him first, ""Why did you kill my father?""  I felt the side of my leg to see if the dagger was still there, and it was.  When I got to the woods, I could see a few people at various distances, but realized that I didn't even know what this killer looked like.  Soon I came upon a clearing where the old woman and another woman stood.  They were just leaving, evidently from visiting a grave.  There was a garage nearby.  The old lady said to look through the crack in the door and I would look ""right at his nose; he's hanged himself.""  I reluctantly peered through the crack, and there, hanging by his feet, but definitely very much dead, was the purported killer, with his mouth slightly open in a sardonic grin, all his teeth showing.

The clerk suggests that we crash the party and if it gets wild, he'll put his hand over his rosebud boutonniere and I'll adjust my rosebud corsage. That will mean we will meet at the car.

"(03/29/98)[""Spoiled miniature woman""]  I am in a wheelchair. I hold a baby that is tiny and abandoned. I am comforting it. It doesn't stay well in my arms I keep adjusting it's position because it limply curls up in an awkward way. There are people in the room with me. Now the baby I took care of grew up and is a tiny miniature woman. I have her in a small cave with a window at the top so I can peek in and check how she's doing. To the small woman, it is a window to the sky that occasionally has a giant eye in it. To me it a porthole to her world. She lives alone. One day, Charlton Heston moves in. He brings her a fresh kill from the hunt. She is uppity and wants him to cook it and serve it. He plops the meat down and says. I got it for you. You will have to gut it, prepare it and cook it if you want to eat. She is angry and haughty, refusing to do anything to help. Charlton walks away from her. But a lower window is broken and a cat comes in. She is afraid and runs to hide for her life. A small orange kitten gets in too. Either I reach in and take them out, or Charlton does. The window is fixed, so she will be safe.",Negative

"I am walking up a gravel road. I turn and look. The view is breathtaking, huge and beautiful. I am surrounded by mountains, rugged and covered with trees. A strong-colored sunset colors the entire scene of thick clouds and mountains in shades of purples, pinks and so on. The clouds cover the mountain peak. I think about going back to the hotel and getting my camera, but I know that I won't get a good picture; more the pity, because 1) the clouds obscure the peak, and 2) it would take too long and the beauty would be gone by the time I got back. So I stand there, looking intently all around. A huge, noisy jet plane is flying to the right. I can't see it because it's above the clouds, or rather in the clouds. It disturbs the beauty. I see a Bic lighter on the ground: litter.",Positive

"First of all, we had our PC over on the desk in the foyer like we have, that kind of squarish desk. Then for some reason on the roll-top desk we had a Mac in addition to mine upstairs. Now I think that was because somebody who went to the school system regularly needed to print out grades, and they had to print out grades on this special perforated paper that would only print in that kind of a printer. And so in my dream I had a solution to my writing dilemma. I would compose my stories up here, then take then down there on a CD and print them there because the printer would take perforated paper or regular paper. And the roll-top desk in my dream was like a huge, grand and stately thing. And, you know, I don't remember a whole lot else. Let's see, you know, it's a bummer. I don't remember anything else that happened, but what I can say is that I did a lot of typing for an ethics report yesterday and reading, Mom did a bunch of reading and I had the system on while I was doing a lot of this. And when I would look up to kind of rest my eyes, I would see, I would be looking at the desk from like right up next to it, and so it would look really huge. You know, all the shelves that are up there; that's what I'm talking about.",Positive

"I'm in a house. There are lots of rooms. I keep going from one to the other looking for what, I do not know. Howard's things are in a dresser (see illustration in original dream book). I can't find my writing. There are lots of beds, single beds; no place to really sleep. The little girl is upset. I take her hand. Someone knocks on the living room door. We go into the hall and into the living room. Several people have sick little people/animals. One ""dog"" is a tiny, naked man. He's also like a baby. Someone (woman) pulls out a worm from his nose. It grows and looks like a crawly white scorpion thing and I say, ""Don't do that."" They take out another one and I realize these things will grow and crawl around and get past them. ""At least kill them if you are going to let them out,"" I say. A woman cuts them with a scissors. I feel they are being irresponsible and endangering me and the little girl. I look closely at the objects on the three pianos and realize they are just like the ones in my parents' house. I am agitated and take the girl and go back to find Howard. Down the hall I go. We pass a room where I see the little girl's exact duplicate, and am amazed. I go to my writing room, but it's crowded with things. I go back to the room where the duplicate girl is and hesitantly enter. A bed with a man in it is on the right. He looks at me and I apologize for going into his place. He smiles and welcomes me. ""Dad,"" he calls and a man comes in from a door. He's very tall. I explain that I saw the duplicate girl and I don't know what to do because my house is full of things that aren't mine.

"I was with my boyfriend Jeremy.  Wherever we were, I left for a moment, following my father.  He made huge waves, with mental powers.  I was surprised to find that he had them, but not overly so.  It was magnificent, the deep blue of the water.  I wondered how he wielded so much power as to make such a huge wave over the entire body of water.  I was about to ask but I realized myself that it wasn't the size, that's just a psychological obstacle.  If you know how to do it at all, you're there.    We were about to go back in; it was now like a secret between my father and I.",Negative
"I am in a room. Two women and myself are listening to a man named Bob how is lecturing on some subject. One of the women has already spoken on this subject and he discounts her thoughts and feelings. He is boring and not very accurate. After the speech, he realizes he has not done well and that the woman was correct. He looks for her to apologize. He respects her now. The women say it's time to go home. We walk out the building and down the street. A bus passes us with cute animals like penguins seating in them. Another bus goes by with a paper mache stork in the back. I am tired now and so the woman uses her remote control to call the car to us. It rushes past us, the bumper dangling down. It is broken. It smashes over a cliff and falls to the desert floor. We go to the edge and look over, I feel fear and vertigo. The woman was pulled into the crash and killed. She rises as a fairy angel spirit. Bob is now a red devil suited spirit and she makes him chase her in an opposite direction from us to save us. We are now tiny, like fairies and  walk through a hedge with beautiful purple flowers. We see on the other side a meadow with a fairy castle at the far end. I see white dog dragons flying toward us, sent by the fairy woman to help us. I am amazed to see that we are really in a meadow right next to the outskirts of our home town. The buildings are huge and loom high above us.",Negative
I was with another man in a courtroom. We were waiting for a judge to come and sentence us for something. I walked outside the room into a large lobby with columns in it and a lofty ceiling.

Then the judge came in and examined his papers regarding our cases.,Negative

"There was an update on FilmForum to fix a bug that had been around for 6 months. Alessandro had a presentation of some features using movies he had watched as he went and I forgot what I had watched. There was a scene of a movie with Leonardo Dicaprio and Martin Scorsese at a table. Leonardo had to break in, but was welcomed. Scorsese was swearing and talking. The angle changed and someone's head got blown off from ""poison"" and you could see inside like a rubber mask and I thought it was awesome. Later I was with Dad and Ezra to get dinner. It was night. We parked and Dad and I crossed the road. A car was coming and I told Dad to stop but he said he was going to go. I was going to show him the scene after we got food. There was a little path with a fence and a guy asked if we could come with him but he seemed dodgy and Dad said no and he started to follow us and I was like ""Dad?!"" There was a door so we went over there and there was an empty room with no roof. The guy reached over the wall and I grabbed his arm and twisted it -- I was really strong. There was a place called '92'. Food appeared in the corner. I was talking about the scene and a young guy said ""he's gay"" and I asked what he meant and he said Scorsese's character was gay. I said I didn't get that at all and he said he was ""too emotional and human-y"". Mom was waiting there too. There was something about The Virgin Spring and Goodfellas. At the end of Inception, Iko Iko was playing but it was weird with sounds and laughter in the background.",Negative

"I am outdoors in a town square. Someone tells me that there is something for me at the nearby window of a large public building -- is it the Post Office? I go there and am handed a calico cat which is the color and size of my pet A. ""That's my cat"", I say, and I am a little surprised. I start the voyage home with her. Somehow this involves a stop at my office at work. X. (a male co-worker) comes in and sees the cat in a carry case on the office floor. ""Close the door"", I say. He does this and then asks, ""Does she roll around the floor [in the cage]?"" ""This isn't a hampster in a wheel"", I answer, expecting him to know better. Then I arrive at my home with the cat, only to find that A. is already there waiting for me. ""Oh, this is another cat"", I realize. I put the two cats together on the living room floor to play. They look very similar, and I think to myself, ""I guess I now have two cats."" The new cat, however, frightens A., and A. stays away. I pick up the new one and hold her in my arms. Suddenly I notice for the first time that despite her beautiful fur, her mouth is ugly and has big teeth, reminding me somehow of a racoon. ""I'll call you 'Coon'"", I decide. Now Coon walks around the living room while A. sleeps. A. begins to shake and twitch in her sleep, and I realize that she is having a disturbed dream -- a nightmare? -- about being bullied by the new cat. She wakes up with a start, looks around for Coon, and moves away from her.",Negative
"Some aliens of a strange sort were trying to take over the world. In some ways they were good and other ways they were evil. The type of thing that they were, they were sort of a great amoebae composed of smaller amoebas and they took over someone's brain, someone's whole body and could manipulate this person and they were very hard to kill. They were good in that for instance if one of them got control, say of a large city, he could manipulate it so that there wouldn't be any accidents, traffic accidents or anything, or anything bad happening. But on the other hand, what was mostly bad about them was the fact that they took away your freedom and you couldn't do anything any more, but just what they were directing you to. I realized they were evil and I wanted to get rid of this one. Apparently not too many of them had been coming so far, and I wanted to get rid of them. I think I had a pistol and it was rather involved action because only one person had been taken over by this thing, but in some way it could manipulate a whole crowd of people even though only one person was actually taken over by the thing. I think I did, attempted to get rid of one, and I almost did, but as I said, they were very hard to kill, so even though you shot and shot at them, they would still be alive and still be capable of hurting these other people, but I think finally the whole problem was solved when there was a second man. The first one had taken over was a male person and the second one was female, and I was going to shoot at this female one who was just walking along alone. When she found out there was another one there trying to manipulate, he got very jealous because she wanted to be the one who did it all, and so she was going to rush in and fight with the other alien. I figured that when this happened, whatever was left of either one of them would be easy enough to kill and I guess this is what happened.",Negative
"I'm An Alter Boy  I'm a priest. I'm at the back of Carter church giving a blessing and spraying people with holy water. Then we walk up to the front of church, carrying things.

I'm not sure it is appropriate to bring deodorant out in view of the congregation, so I leave it in the hallway of the back room. I go out next to the pulpit to get a sign and move it.

"I was back at the old house on Lakeland Drive for a visit. I looked out the patio door and saw that they had removed the deck. I went to the backdoor in the laundry room and opened it. They had made the yard much higher, the height of the door, both to the left and to the front of the door. You could step out about 3 or 4 feet. In the grass directly in front of the door there were cement strips. They were about 5 feet long and only about 6 inches wide. They went to the top of the yard and had about 12 inches of grass between each one. I tried to use them to step up and see the yard but wasn't successful because they weren't wide enough. I stepped back inside and tried to close the door and saw a snake hanging from the top of the door. I grabbed something and tried to knock it off and to the outside and close the door quickly but there was another. I swung at it a couple of times and couldn't knock it out. As the dream progressed there were snakes everywhere in the house. I don't like snakes at all so I was panicking and terribly frightened by all of these snakes.",Negative

Bradley Cooper was there and there were some fences and he was in a 'door of fantasy' (led to another realm). We were trying to hide from something. I joined him and then we ran into this glass room. It was inside another room, and was just glass all the way around (in a circle). He said ""[someone] is nub"". We closed the door and then this guy who was like Ralph Fiennes in Harry Potter came and had to use magic to get in. Everyone went crazy and smashed the walls. There was an old guy there. I left and Ezra, some others and I were in a restaurant. A radio station was playing like 6IX. I was looking at the food (it was like a buffet) and there was rice, gnocchi and prawns.

"I found myself in my house in the country, but I first saw it as it is: a house that is easy to break into. Then I saw a big dog and several small ones. The big one told me: ""Don't come close or I'll bite you,"" and the smaller ones also wanted to hurt me. At that moment I saw my house like a ranch, with dust on its walls. Then I saw a man who looked like a guard and he told me not to come near or they would bite me.

And I had this like baby CD player in my closet that I was playing this CD on, and it was light blue and it had like red buttons on it. And it was like for babies. And I'm in my closet listening to this, with my door closed, and Mom needed me to come downstairs for something, and then I woke up. But that was kind of cool. You know, maybe she will play in a movie. Singers who like go and act, I think they kind of get distracted from their singing. So it's good that she never tried to act.",Negative
"Walking somewhere - not conscious of where, but outside in a non-built-up area, where there are trees and a highway bridge - bit of construction going on, I think. But it's been raining and continues to, and it's flooding. There are some other people walking along here - I think we all have the same goal, more or less, but we're not together. At least I'm not part of the others as a group, but I don't think they're all a group. We're aiming under the bridge (there's no traffic on it), and the water is rising. I guess there's a bit of creek here, and there's a good bit of dirty water rising here. It's not so hard to walk in it, and I wouldn't have chosen this, but there's nothing to be done about it, or to get worried about yet. Now the water's up to my neck, but it doesn't seem to be getting any higher, at least. So we'll keep on slogging.",Negative
"There was a Moses hologram card with drippy blood letters like horror movies; about Moses and Jesus producers. On the back half was an invitation to church. In between the lockers loud music was playing sort of like punk stray cats, and punk rock kids were dancing in the hallways. They were so happy to be dancing they started throwing their clothes all over the floor. The music was so good and I was dancing. But eventually we had to leave the hallway and go home. Between 5-6 p.m. there was an advertising meeting. They said at 5-6 p.m. they were either closed for the day or out to lunch or very busy with marketing and will get behind and then you won't get your paycheck.

In the time it took me to talk to that talker lady he had gotten a 4-year college degree in chemistry. We talked about the vertical strength necessary to balance out horizontal weight. The original 3 bank robbers robbed the N train which went through Belton Honea Path. They took the horses back in the woods behind the tool shed. The man asked me, ""Did you see any bank robbers?""

He grabbed a kid and walked off (to look like a parent and not get noticed). He went into a building and he knew who had what power, but couldn't do so much at once. He would use mindreading to make everyone not nice. He went into a shop and this girl said the money was in the back (to give to him when he returned someone). He went to get it and went crazy again. He cut open some snake looking thing and was trying to convince people that it didn't hurt it. There was a dog cut open and he cried saying that when he returned it he would get money for being a hero, but it was hard for him.",Negative
I was at Mom's new house. It was different and I had a bunk bed with a double bed underneath. This girl was sleeping over on the bottom. I was thinking that I'd take the bottom soon.

Clayton and I were running through buildings and such in a town or a school. There was a room with grass and steps inside. There was stuff on the outside and we climbed it. Then there was like an earthquake. We held on and it was kind of fun. Then there was a little kitten which was special and could breathe fire. I was watching Dawson's Creek with Mom. Joey and some guy had been trying to have sex for ages but something always went wrong. Sometimes I was Joey. She and the guy got into a car and the guy pretended to be a taxi driver and drove them around and someone was trying to kidnap them.,Negative

We were having a buffet dinner and eating on a card table placed at the foot (sidewalk end) of the driveway. The card table kept collapsing. Finally I saw another card table top in the driveway, so I tore the present top off the wobbling legs and put the other top on. Then I noticed a deep pit where the top had been lying. I went to look for some boards to cover the hole with, and when I found some and went back to the driveway, the hole was gone. I don't know what happened to the parents.",Negative

"(04/13/01)[""Toilet flow direction.""] I am lying down at some gate like entrance to the beach and the ocean, waiting for my brother Jake. Lots of people go into the beach area. They are going to look for green round objects that might be food that drifts up on shore. One woman demonstrates her swimming stroke she will use in the ocean. I think to myself I can't swim. But maybe I can walk the beach and find some. As I wait, a ""Royal Highness"" who is the Minister of Something to the King comes by. They can't figure out when you push down on the flusher handle of a toilet how to regulate the direction of the water flow and which direction is the right one. I call out, ""Your Royal Highness"" and tell him that you could flush it and observe and then figure it out.

"I don't know who it was but there was a girl who told me to go down this river that is off of Moose Pond. She said, ""It's easy to find because there is a pineapple tree right at the entrance"". I decided to go and it was really easy to find. There were these huge bright yellow cactus-like trees all over the place. Very surreal looking, almost like Dr. Suess. I looked up into one tree and saw tons of big bananas. I kept on paddling in my blue canoe and I somehow felt as through I had been down this river before. In fact, I knew I had been in the entrance area but I guess I had turned around and not gone down. I decided to keep going. On the left hand side there were about 6 cages in a row. I don't know how I knew but I feel as though someone told me (although there was no one around) that these animals had been experimented on. They were fucked up. The animals were spazzing out, banging around in their little cages. One of the animals I remember was a sort of small dinosaur-like creature with a saucer shaped head that could stand upright on two legs, another animal, actually, there were 2 in 1 cage - were these monkeys with really long legs. They just stood there. I kept paddling on. Once again on the left side some swimming pools, that were built right on the edge of the river, passed by. They looked really nice. On either side of the pools were these big billboards that advertised the pools - something like ""Johnson Development Estates"". I don't know. There were not very many people at the pools. There were no other buildings around except the pools themselves. The pools were just surrounded by jungle and the two billboards. I kept going on and came across a lot of people sitting at computers. They were learning how to use them. There was a big screen so that I could see what they were writing. This computer area was much the same as the pools - surround by nothing. There was a pool area connected with this computer school place. It was shaped in the same way that the desks were arranged and actually looked like it was an area where people could learn computers while sitting in the water. But it was empty. I felt as though the stuff they were doing on their computers was very basic and boring to watch. Except for this one bald-head guy who was doing his own thing. On his screen, there was a picture of a man sitting at his desk with his hands on the desk. This guy was able to make this image appear to swivel in his chair. I kept paddling on. On the left there were more animals in cages. I decided to turn around because it looked like it was going to rain hard up where the lake was. I paddled really fast, trying to avoid the people who were walking the other way in the river. It was strange because sometimes the sky overhead would get completely dark so I had trouble seeing and trying to steer around the people. One family walks by and one of the kids had dropped a ski boot which was floating on the surface. As I was paddling back I had a sort of nervous feeling - maybe because of the darkness, or the animals. I also felt as though I needed to get back to Hal who I think was at the lake.

It was then 4:00. He came out without tie, hair and clothes all mussed up. I made him go back in and change, then we left for the formal.

I walk them out, only to discover a classroom full of people. I realize the landlord has allowed them to share my entryway. So I suggest to the teacher that we share costs for a barrier partition. Then I see a man at the other end and I go to him and say, ""What do you think you are doing? This is a home."" He's seated on my couch with another woman; they are talking. He says to her, ""How about coming over to my place?"" meaning sex. She sighs and apologizes for being sympathetic, and thereby misleading him. She says, ""Girls are like that.""

When I actually got well and returned to school, in my dream, Mr. Chapman was rehearsing a play and just as I had dreamed it. We started talking and I told him about it. At one point during the rehearsals, he was demonstrating a dance with the main dancer, to show the others how to do it. She had very bright colors on and they went whirling and twisting all over the place. Somehow I was in love with Mr. Chapman and I think he was in love with me. I think he made love to me even though he was married and I cried because I was so sorry he was married. This is all very indefinite and I don't remember much.",Positive

(!) Then he asks me to go with him to get groceries and clothes from a Co-op. Peter Steele has to sign the slip; I take out from a freezer: vegetables and frozen meat: ""Is that alright Father?"" ""Yes""; then Father Andrew gets new altar things and has them sent home; I feel very happy - we all go back to the Church and sit at table together, but then they drive off before we do.",Positive
"Well, I will try to put down this complicated dream. I was visiting at the house of two friends of mine, a married couple, both of whom go to the University of Miami. I was relaxing in their living room when another couple who lives behind this couple walked in. Of the second couple, the wife is very attractive and has a magnificent figure. I was thinking on this occasion as I have in real life, whether the husband was very adequate to the wife. The wife said she might like to go out and take a walk. It was raining slightly, so I said something to the effect that it was only drizzling very slightly and it might be nice to take a walk out there in the rain. So she walked out, started walking down the block, and then I came out to follow her. The neighborhood wasn't exactly like any neighborhood I've ever seen. It was somewhat similar to the terrain in San Francisco. The houses were up on sloping hills and she walked down to a house on the corner and sat on the grass on one of these slopes. I ran on the top of the slope and then ran down the slope and sat beside her. At this point when I reached her, she was no longer the wife of this guy. She was no longer the same girl, but she was Oriental. She had an Oriental face, which didn't surprise me somehow. She began talking in that inscrutable way of Orientals, with a little proverb, something about the fact that I would go very far in life, because I was good at business deals. For example, if I wanted to make a good deal on my brother's car (by the way, I have no brother and in the dream at the time I realized I didn't have a brother, yet it wasn't completely shocking to me). I sort of knew that this was an example, that she didn't really think I had a brother, but anyway if I sold my brother's car, I could sell half-interest in it for $200 plus ten dollars for title fee, and thus I would make an amazing profit. Somehow at the time I understood. That's the end of that dream.",Negative

He had a register for registering the rental fee and he watched how the price went up to what he paid for it, then he would be happy to see that he was gaining money. He was waiting for $24 to pop up. We walked by for presents. I got 2 popcorn balls, then the man called me back and took the popcorn back and gave me a poppyseed roll instead.

"Paint Splattering Couches  I enter a building like the Big Electric Company building in Wilmerton. One needs access to the large metal door, and I get in. Inside there are some couches, paints, and things that I think will need to be separated or grouped. My friend Sherman Andrews is there. He runs and jumps up on a couch, putting his feet up on the back of the couch where one would lean back. He leaves footprints of splattered paint on the couch. Another person splatters paint footprints on the couch. A person I know from Brimson, Alec Johnson, is there. He and I cover a couch up with a blanket. First, he leads this and places the blanket the narrow way, exposing the ends of the couch. I say that we should turn the blanket. When we do, it covers more of the couch.",Negative

I had to walk between two trains that were parking on a side track. I saw big doughnuts that a lady was baking. A fellow was carrying a bag of papers and his hat fell off. I picked it up and I noticed another hat was on the ground. A fellow just walked by before, so I yelled to him if it was his, but he had a hat on.

"I am in the center of town, and I'm about to walk home. However, there is a group of 5 or 10 kids hanging around the corner, and as soon as I catch up to them I see that we're about to be forced to go somewhere in a vehicle that looks a bit like an ambulance, but I get a feeling it's the police. I realize maybe I shouldn't have gone over there, but I'm still curious to know what's going on. Just in case we're being arrested, I demand to know what we're being taken in for. A man says we'll find out soon enough. The next part of the dream is fuzzy, but then I remember being in my house, in the den with the lights off while my brother and his friends are in the living room. Something makes me lucid for a moment, to some extent, and I decide there's no reason to stay in the house, so I go out the back door. Then I'm blank- I'm not sure if I just woke up, or lost lucidity, or what exactly happened, but the next thing I remember someone's (my mother?) telling me Ms. L. has died. I can't believe this, and for some reason it actually feels strange, and eerie, that I had seen her not too long ago. I think it was a car accident. I really can't believe it, and want to check the newspaper or the internet to make sure this is really going on.",Negative
"There was a Kenny vs. Spenny movie. First, Spenny and I went for a walk and we went down the street next to North Midvale Primary School. It was night and dark and spooky. He was with his kid (or someone else's). I said it was dangerous and he said he had a 'scythe'. This black guy walked past us and I could only see his clothes because of the contrasting darkness. Then, Kenny, someone else and I were running away from Spenny, or all of us were running away from someone. We ran into a toilet. The three of us went into a room with the toilets and closed the door. I tried to lock it and it was a switch lock (like on the front door), but I couldn't get it in time and he burst in. They were yelling and then Spenny reached into his pocket and this guy fired his gun and killed him. The guy said ""he was reaching for a gun"". Kenny checked Spenny's pockets and there was a pack of chewing gum. He said ""a tic-tac? You shot him because of a tic-tac?!"" Kenny was like 'he's my best friend!'. Then there was a second one (like that was the first way the scene was shot), which was what had actually happened. There were teenagers talking in a room. One said ""that was how we were originally going to shoot it"" or they were going to bring in a twin of Spenny to keep in, but it wouldn't have worked.",Negative
"I was dreaming about taking some sort of trip. I arranged 4 packs of cigarettes, Lucky Strikes, which were partially empty, each to different degrees, to divide my vacation into four parts. I gave them to someone, telling what date each stood for, I remember one that was for July 20, the other dates have faded. One pack was almost empty, having 4 or 5 cigarettes left. Transition here fades and I was then in a store trying to use a pack of tickets for a trip on some lake. The man I was talking to runs the soda fountain at the corner drug store. He told me that I must have 2 tickets next to each other on the ship with the number 34 at the bottom right hand corner of each one. The tickets were arranged with numbers much like on a calendar. I didn't find tickets arranged this way I only found one that had a 34 on the corner. Transition again fades and changes and I was on the edge of the lake. English professors began appearing, mostly ladies. They had dangling earrings, and once again numbers came into my dream. There was English 309 A, English 219, etc. and each one had a professor appearing for it. I was awakened at this point. Interpretation Much of this dream had faded.

This makes me think that it wasn't Len U at all but rather another man that I had met at Mensa and BPE and as described here. When we were at the funeral home I saw his wife and maybe a daughter. When I saw him in his casket I didn't think it really looked like him. We were getting in line to view the body. As we were walking to get in line there were other people laid out in their caskets as well. There was something about after the wake gathering for a meal.,Positive

We had to do something to get in and this guy came and we made up a story about why we were there and tried to keep him away from seeing the open parts. But he saw them and we tried to make up an excuse. Then I was at a shop, at a table with some guy who was the Mexican from Kiss of the Spider Woman. I purposely left something facing him so he could learn the truth and then he gave me money to get a water bottle. There was a big bottle of Mount Franklin. He came into the shop while I was at the counter and the lady was counting my coins. Then Chevy Chase was on our side and was in the movie playing on the TV in the shop. His character was called something like George Stromapolous.I called him and he answered in the movie so I talked in code. I watched some of the movie and there was lots of boofy hair. I thought he was hot in it. I needed to buy some stuff, including a USB. This guy motioned for a brush. I joked that it had 'been on your head'.

"I'm taking this course in drama and it seems I was reading this play, sort of a combination between Ipsen and Strenberg and it was supposed to be sort of a grim play about this man who died and his young daughter about 7 who worshipped him, and how he said all sorts of cruel things before he died, and she's all upset and disillusioned and ruined for life. And about her mother--something sort of strange about her. This is the type of thing that happens fairly often in my dreams. While I knew I was sort of reading this play and actually I was reading a page every so often, I was sort of watching it from this superior position and I was also taking part in it. It seems I was more involved with the mother and this daughter than anybody else. It was strange and hard to remember anyway. It seems the girl was about 17 and she was a very good pianist and she wanted to date these boys that were around the house. It seems strange that even though her father died all these years ago, he was still there. He was dictating should and shouldn't do, telling her she wasn't going to date these boys. But the mother was saying, ""I think she should be allowed to date every once in a while."" He was being real mean about it. These 3 characters shifted around until they were very like my mother and my father and my sister. I don't know what happened. I think she finally got to date who she wanted to.",Negative

"Doctors were doing something to alter patients minds. Noah Wyle, an actor on ER, had found out about something that some of his coworkers were doing that was very wrong. They cornered him and took him to this upstairs location kind of like a loft. They significantly injured him physically, though I don't get the sense that they beat him. It was like they had put some kind of cuffs or something around his wrists and ankles and caused severe abrasions that were about 2 inches wide all the way around on each ankle and wrist. He was bleeding a lot. Down the middle of his chest were severe abrasions. He tried to sneak down to the locker room so he could clean himself up. He was trying to hide it so know one would find out what they had done. He was doing this to protect himself because they had done this to threaten him so he wouldn't report them for what they had done. He was putting on his scrubs and he had tied a whole lot of medications for his injuries tied to a belt. He was trying to hide them under his scrubs. A nurse coming in for her shift happened to look in and saw all the medications. He was talking to someone. That person didn't notice but this nurse did. Before that, I was talking to a supervisor. I guess I worked there. She had told me to check an ad and see if some things were still on sale. I had to stand on a wall heater or something to be able to look at an ad that was posted on the wall. I don't remember what it said but I decided from looking at it that the stuff was not on sale any longer. I never did go back and tell her that. She also wanted me to put out some new things on a shelf. She instructed me that even though the boxes were very attractive that I was to take the things out of the boxes to display them. There was a section of shelves where we displayed over-the-counter medication for employees. We kept them in the boxes. She wanted to make sure that I took these out of the boxes to display them. I went by one area that there were all kinds of hair care. It was large bottles. They were all green. Doctor B came by. I didn't say anything to him. I don't remember any conversation or anything. I just had the sense that he was there. I didn't do anything with the hair care products.",Positive
"In trying to recall this dream, the first image was one of a number of elements fused together. Mainly they were a picture of the necks of two people, two of the main characters in the dream. One of them was an older man, and I believe it was Dr. Hall, who was playing the role of a secretary in this dream. The other person was an older woman, heavy set and along with this image there was a picture of a tape recorder. The dream seemed to have something to do with the APA and a bicycle was also involved. There was some kind of a problem regarding, I believe it was, my betting into the APA. The older woman was arguing for me. There was also something about a radio playing. Day residue for this dream -- a good number of the elements derived from a short conversation I had with Dr. Hall just before going to sleep. Mainly the APA, the tape -- the tape recorder, and a character who was, I believe, Dr. Hall, in the dream itself. The older woman, I believe, seemed to be Gladys Friedman whom I had written today.",Negative
"Joe and Steve drank up my whiskey. They let two bottles of beer in the basement. Peter Arendas, Brother Steve and I were in a car. Peter was driving. We were going thru the square. We hit a lot of traffic. I watched the light and I said, ""Go,"" and it was stop. Steve saw some pennies on the ground. He went over and picked one up, then another. He picked them so slow another guy jumped in and picked the other 3 up. Peter started to run. Steve held me back. I broke lose and ran way ahead of Pete, then I jumped up and landed on top of a building. They went in and I flew to where I thought they would come out. I saw a donkey also and his master and a boy. I went into a building and these biblica persons were playing some kind of game. They made funny signs in writing that I couldn't understand. The boy tried to work them out, but was always wrong. I wanted to put the bed light on, but it wouldn't go on. I saw a lot of shoes in front of the door. I put on the wall switch and the bed light went on.",Negative
"I remember being in some sort of a classroom with many people, whom I don't know. Then I walked down a hall and went into what appeared to be a movie or an auditorium with a screen in the front. There seemed to be something on the screen, but I don't remember what. When everyone started to get up, I looked behind me and saw an army officer, male, middle-aged and bald on top. He started walking toward the front of the room. Then I looked toward the screen and there was pictured some army officers who looked busy, as if in conference or something, but they were standing and moving around. Then I saw my brother in the background on the screen. He was in uniform and pacing back and forth. He had a trench coat draped over his left arm, and he looked unconcerned. (My brother is 24.) Next I remember leaving the movie and going through two open doors which appeared to be elevator doors, and led into an elevator. I went in and before the doors closed, people started turning around, saying, ""Close the doors,"" apparently because light was shining into the dark auditorium. The doors finally closed by themselves and I felt relieved. That is the end of the dream.",Positive
"I saw a dog digging around a hole in the ground. Something happened. I can't recall not, but the hole was blown up or it caved in on the squirrels. The ground was black like coal dust. One squirrel got out of the black stuff. He was all black. He ran in flight from the dog we could see him run down the trail he usually took. I figured there was another squirrel in the black stuff. The dog grabbed a mouthful of it and I could see a squirrel wiggle in his mouth. He released it and a black squirrel dropped to the ground and started to run away, but his speed was slow because the dog hurt him when he had him in his mouth. So the dog went after him and instead of grabbing him in his mouth, he caught him by the tail with his paw and held him up.",Positive
"(07/30/97)[""Snow boating.""] I am on top of a mountain with other people and we need to return home. I guess we are in enemy territory and we are being chased. We find a boat and decide to try and slide down the snow covered mountain in the boat. I count the people. There are twenty. I see how tightly we are packed in. We slide down to a cliff and stop. I peer over the edge and see a river with black people swimming in it. I see we are soon to leave the snow and enter the jungle. The men chasing us are near by. We get out and try to sneak through the area to get to the jungle. I lean up against a wall listening to the British and German soldiers talking, waiting for our chance to slip by them.",Negative
"Two Jacks of Spades  I'm eating at a fancy restaurant with my aunt Willow Redding and my sister Heather and others. I have linguini. There are a few strands of hair in my pasta. Heather gives me some of her food, which has hair in it too. I am in what I think is my front yard. Grandpa and Grandma Redding are there. My cousin Steve Redding and his wife Loretta are there. I talk to Steve. After he expresses an interest in talking with relatives, I tell him that he probably doesn't want to talk to Heather. Then Steve is on the phone with Heather. She has called, and he answered the telephone. I have a deck of cards on a box-like footstool. I say there are two jacks of clubs. I am mistaken. There are two jacks of spades.",Positive
