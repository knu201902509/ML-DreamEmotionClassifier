"I went upstairs for somebody and there on my table was a thick paper bound AAUW book ""America's next twenty years."" Oh dear, I thought, ""Then it was I that failed to pass on the missing book. How can I get along without owning up?"" I skim through book seeing how quickly I can finish it.",Positive
"He said my pin was like a TV medal. I said I'd have to hurry on because Miss W. didn't like us to be late. In the dining room I poured a glass of water for myself and then started to pour some jelly-like mix which began to drip and I called for a plate to catch it, went to a drawer to get a grapefruit knife, returned to the table to find my glass gone and an empty cup and plate instead. I complained and returned to find and fill the other glass.",Negative
"I was at school with Mom, and her and I were up at this little mixing room type of a thing, up above on the third floor of the main building. But it was really supposed to be a computer lab. Anyway, sorry about that saw in the background. Anyway, Mom and I were in this room, and she bent something like a computer that makes it really stand out, and she has to get help from Uncle Larry. I think this is how it went. It was so complicated, I can't even remember it. But anyway, she makes the computer stand out, and Uncle Larry comes up and is criticizing me because I don't ever work with him on anything, and isn't going to help us now. Matter of fact, he threatens to activate the alarm system. And then I think somebody was riding around outside in a little golf cart thing like the administrators do, and for some reason or other we had to get out of there quick because he did something else with the computer that was going to start this virus thing going around the school. And so we got on this golf cart and we just drive, and I didn't recognize, and we went downstairs via the elevator into the library. Then we were talking with Mrs. Talmadge and she said that I had this problem with rocking back and forth, which I don't, but that the problem was common with blind people, but I don't have it. And Mrs. Talmadge said that I had a problem with rocking back and forth and that we needed to work on that.",Negative
"I was at the CAS office. I noticed that they had done alot of rearranging of the two storage closets, although they didn't look like they did in waking life. The one closet had a glass window in one side of it. The closet light was on and I could see inside, which is how I noticed the change. The closet was 3 or 4 times longer than it was wide. Along the end furthest from me, one of the narrower sections, there were shelves three shelves, spaced evenly up the wall. The only thing on the shelves were several different kinds of disposable diapers for babies. I realized that they were left from when Kara C was a baby. At first I was surprised that there were so many different kinds but then realized that they had probably tried different brands until the decided on the one that they liked best. Kara C is probably a teenager now, or close to it. I wondered why they don't just get rid of them. There would certainly be plenty of charities that could make very good use of them. But I realized that would certainly be uncharacteristic of them.",Negative
"It felt like we were flying in this plane, seems like there were a lot of people around, by the sound. The plane had to land, and it landed right in our living room. I Guess it was flying up around the ceiling. You need room to fly to move a plane around and so the pilot just took it outside and landed it but I don't know where it landed. It tried to land somewhere downstairs (in the living room).",Positive
"Marissa Camden wearing black coat and fur on sleeves, and Father Andrew, in black clerical suit; they come back from a social gathering; I wave ""hi"" as they pass through my bedroom on their way to their apartment. Our bedroom is a mess; and I apologize; but Marissa laughs: ""After all the neatness you see, this shouldn't bother you."" - See SS teacher (female) walking Tina (?) home. - At a mountain resort: looked like my sketch.",Positive
"I was going to a big dance and I was getting ready. I was going with a boy I used to date once it seemed that he was going to come and pick me up. However, before I could go, for some reason I had to go see our family doctor (about 48, male). I went up to his office and sat in the waiting room while he was finishing with the person ahead of me. Finally I went in and right away I sensed that he was dead drunk. He acted very queerly, demanded what I was there for. I told him I had to be examined so I could go to the dance. I was somewhat afraid of him. I remember there were cupboards in his office with all kinds of bottles on them. He examined me very quickly. I don't remember the details of the examination, but I knew it was very short. I left his office very puzzled.",Negative
"As you could probably tell, I've got this snotty nose you would not believe. [laugh] Anybody listening to this tape would not want to listen to it. Last night I had a dream about Christmas. I dreamt that it was Christmas already, and we were up in Jackson visiting Aunt Christine and Uncle Burt. [blows nose] Aunt Christine and Uncle Burt had moved to a new place and it was a big, huge place in northern New York, kind of an old rural area. And they had this big living room that they were going to have a Christmas party in. It was like half the size of the Coliseum. It was like the banquet hall at the Wyndham Hotel where we had our Spanish conference banquet and dance in. There were three Christmas trees at this widthwise end. [blows nose], and I asked Mom to show me how to turn them on, turn the lights on, and she said they weren't even decorated yet. And people were starting to come and we took Aunt Christine and Uncle Burt and Granny was still alive at the time, and we went outside to see the waterfall on the river that ran by their house, and we saw a waterfall that she called Luria Fall. And then I woke up.",Negative
"A boy and a guy climbed up the wall of this building to break in somewhere. They were good guys but needed to do it. It was day. The cops came and all went around the outside of the fence. One went inside the fence. The guy from before was now Seth Rogen and he pretended to be retarded (the area was known for retards) and watched the cops and then walked off around the corner. I was watching from his point of view and I could feel the adrenaline as he walked away and then when he was out of sight, he ran.",Positive
"I was lying down in my bed and my mom was on the phone. Then Satan came out from my bed and he was a wolf. He started walking to me and I started shaking and then I woke up and was still shaking after the dream, and then I cried.",Negative
"I was coming off desk duty at 1 a.m. I picked up my books in the dark and started to come upstairs to bed because I was exhausted. When I arrived at the bottom of the stairs, my legs gave way and I slid to the floor. All I could think was how silly. Now I just want to lie here and sleep till morning, but people don't do that. Then a fire door opened and there were kids from the house peeking at me through a crack in it. They said, ""Did she faint?"" But I couldn't answer because I was just too tired to bother. Then I was coming out of the drugged state and started to laugh because I was still at the foot of the stairs and not in bed.",Negative
"I can't recall much about the earlier part of the dream. Only two fragments that happened just before awakening. It seemed as if I were standing at some counter and looking toward some large TV set. The counter is somewhat like what we have at home, except that in the dream this was a longer u-shaped one. It seemed as though my children were sitting along this counter, and Lance was diagonally opposite me. At one point he began to cry and complained that Drake had done something to him. He was writing something on a pad and I said to him that he had started the situation by saying something or doing something to Drake first. Then for some reason it seemed it was supposed to be 9 o'clock on a Friday night and there was some show just starting. The show that was just starting seemed not to be one that we wanted to watch, and someone said something about getting a different channel. What appeared on the screen was a male Negro who was saying something about his not having done it. The person in charge was trying to get information about what had happened, and it seemed as if the setting were on the deck of a ship. Another male said something to the man in charge of the ship, which seemed to implicate the Negro again and then someone said, ""Well, we're right back to the beginning again,"" in terms of trying to understand how it began or what happened. Then the scene shifted to an apparent medieval setting as there were knights in armor sitting on horses. This one knight appeared to be talking to his horse's tail. There was some woman there dressed in very full and elaborate clothing and she said something to the knight and then began to ride away. The knight said something to stall for time and as she drove away, she bent backwards towards his horse and began to say something to his horse's tail. There was something about his horse's tail becoming entangled with an adjoining horse's tail. There was also some element in which the viewing perspective changed and it was something about if one slid a file forward and through it slightly, it would bump into the top part of one of the horse's legs, and this would cause him to start running. That's all I can remember.",Positive
"I am in a house and two young married couples are there kissing and hugging and I feel like a fifth wheel. I smile indulgently remembering there are lots of bedrooms here and stroll on out to have breakfast. I go outside and see Charla. I am dancing in an exercise kind of way. There is lots of good energy; it's time to move again. I pick up my mail and open an ad for the new Mobil station, which has just been remodeled and open for business. Charla says, ""What did I get?"" and I say, ""This is just an ad. Let's go get breakfast."" She picks up a glass of milk from a table in a cafe where people are seated and drinks. We smile and go on to fix breakfast.",Positive
"I am somewhere, supposedly at my place of work, only it isn't. I want to pee and try to in a bowl; it stinks and is exposed. A woman, perhaps Maren, follows me around. I am annoyed. I try to clean things up a bit, wash a dish, move a bottle to the sink. Then I go out into a large warehouse-like area and toward an open door. The woman moves ahead of me. I see the tip of a huge, black, shiny, pretty and dangerous tank. The woman steps out and is killed. I turn and walk back through the long huge warehouse building going toward the back exit. I am aware that maybe I should check and see if the woman really is dead, but that would be dangerous to me. Maybe I should warn other people, but I don't. I decide with a bit of guilt that I will call people and warn them after I get to my office, my place of work. I see cupboards and cabinets and think about hiding in one of them. I realize that is what I usually do in a dream, and decide not to do that this time. I find the back room, where two men are working, stacking wood furniture this company makes. I pass them without a word and go out the back door and around the corner. I look to the right and see the back end of the black tank which now looks like a large fuzzy black elephant, the same kind of fuzzy as my purse. I then run to the left and go up some steps to another building where my office is, only it's not my office and nobody is there and hasn't been there for a long time. [BL]",Negative
"I was at some weird place. These people decided they had to kill Calvin off and they shot him in the back of the head. But he didn't die and he ran away. There was no water around as it was rare. But, there were these (what I called) 'tribunals' to pump water from some place (which I thought I had taken from Kin-Dza-Dza). Ms Quintana gave me drops for my nose/eye. The liquid from the drops goes down your throat. I went to find Calvin. I was outside some shops and I ran away from people. There was this trail somewhere and I found Elijah, Seamus, Dmitri and Daryl. Someone had a fight.",Negative
"(Post-Grad:11/27/03)  In a class with my high school math teacher Mr. Hodgkin teaching.  My high school friend Benji was there, dressed up to be a valet driver, I think.  He made comment to me being dressed the same and I told him about my job blackjack dealing.  They were playing with toy cars.  Then I was in the lake near my maternal Grandma Jane's house, swimming.  I went to the middle of the lake and there was a ridge separating the deep and shallow parts.  I climbed up on it.",Negative
"I drove my car to school, and parked it behind the music building, right up next to the fence. I had something in my hand which my inner voice kept referring to as a Blitz, and I didn't want it. It looked a lot like a candybar. I rolled down my window and threw the Blitz out. The Blitz struck the fence with a hollow rattling sound and dropped from sight.",Positive
I lost my shoes. I came out from this underpass and saw a party going on in a gray two-story house. There were all these crusty punk rockers drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon and Budweiser and the music was blaring onto the street. The balcony looked like it was going to fall because it was so packed. Some dude leaned over the balcony and puked onto the street.,Positive
Most of the people from Good Advice went to a fish and chip restaurant. We had a 4 person table and a 2 person table. Tristan sat at the 2 person table on the other side of the room and I sat on the other table. Frederick was there as well. I got a chicken burger.,Positive
"I go swimming with Steve, not Pedro. We have to take the train, I forgot my money and borrow $15.- from Steve. I promise to pay him back by getting the money at home and returning to pick him up. I take the train home and get involved with Zena - some problem I can't recall; M. is using the phone, so I am delayed, so I decide to page Steve at the Y and tell him I will be late. I call and she asks me to wait while they page him. I realize that he must have gone on to work by himself. I call him at work and he says ""Never worry, see you tomorrow, keep the $15. We can share the shampoo"" (expensive kind).",Negative
"I was with Frederick, who I was dating, and he'd been offered this weird job and all he had to do was live in this cave for 8 weeks. The cave was on the beach and we were walking down there to see it and discuss the details. It was spooky and I reached for his hand and we held hands as we walked down. We made a joke about it being haunted, and the person said it was. When we got to it, it was really creepy and I said we should just go, but they kind of forced us inside and then we couldn't leave. It was some 'devil' cage or something and after the 8 weeks, one of us had to be sacrificed. I think we managed to escape, but I don't remember anything else.",Negative
"The dream started talking to my good friend Del online.  I felt that since he knew what I was trying to learn, talking to him about it would somehow be wrong.  After that the dream was all around a decision that my mother and my brother Stuart made, that we would move to Hollywood.  I was crying hard.  I didn't want to leave so close to graduation.  I got violent and panicked, trying to run to talk to my online friend Marty.",Negative
My dream was that I had a crush on my history teacher and after class I went home and he was there. Then I started talking to him about how I had a crush on my history teacher. After talking about it for a while I still hadn't realized that he was my history teacher. Instead he just seemed like a friend. Then I woke up.,Negative
"I don't know where we were, but a bunch of people from school, some others and I were there. One was a guy that I had been with when I met Jewel Staite. We had this other picture of me and her. Someone was coming to see him and he gave the photos to me to hide somewhere (so no-one knew anything about him). Eugene and Darius had a room there. They changed something on the door, so it said Eugene was Finnish and Darius was French. I think Eugene and I were going out. I got into a car and Ezra was in the driver's seat. Eugene came and the car started reversing out into the street and wouldn't stop. He got stuck on the bonnet, but decided to stay on the outside of the car. There was a girl with a balloon and I grabbed it and it started shrinking and popped and she blamed me, but I said it was already popped (it was). I saw this director guy and recognized him. I found something about him and was like 'That's where I know you from!'. Some guy asked us if we knew any actors (for a job). Then it showed some of us entering a building (we had taken up the offer). I had to get in to this place and I had a bag strapped and this other guard checked it. While they were distracted, Theodore slipped into the toilet just behind them. I went into the bar and Johanna and two others were there. I went into the next room and some girl I had met before decided she wanted help with applicable math. They cancelled intro calc to do it and Fatima came in and was trying to work out what happened. This girl and guy were trying to get this other guy horny and when he did they pulled a gun on him. Maeby (Arrested Development) was outside a window of the building on a high storey, attached to the inside door. If someone opened the door, she would be killed. A lady tried to open it, but she couldn't. Maeby slid into this thing, so the cord wouldn't be as short and therefore wouldn't cause her to be killed. Ezra was confused about what she did (it was something that she wouldn't have been able to do in real life). There was some experiment, where these people had guy a big hole and there was lots of sand next to it. Something changed the reality and now Germans had dug a bigger hole. The reality kept changing. Some of the new realities included Alejandro being there, our postcode was 6064 and other random stuff. There was some alien disease. It was like the Hex virus from Red Dwarf and I was thinking 'Rimmer!'. I was also watching some Red Dwarf thing. Cat was on it, but I didn't recognize him or any of the others, except for Rimmer. In this reality, I had met Chris Barrie. There was a book by someone which said that The Beatles were their favourite band. There was a shiny spot in the book, which had Jared Padalecki written in it.",Negative
"I had just finished my lunch at home and was riding a red bicycle back to Shaker Heights High School. As I rode along Lee Road, I noticed how dark the sky was becoming. Large gray clouds completely obscured the sun that had been shining a few minutes before. I knew I must hurry for it would rain very soon. Upon reaching the school I parked my bike and hurried to my English class. The entire class was present and only my chair in the front row was vacant. As I entered the classroom I had a strange feeling that I had been absent from this class for a great length of time. Yet no one seemed to be surprised at my arrival. In fact no one in the entire room said a word to me. The class consisted of both my high school and college friends, but I was puzzled and disappointed that my girlfriend was not present.",Negative
"I enter a square room that is sort of a vacation cabin. It has been unused and neglected for years. Today I am cleaning it up. Old food, all moldy and yucky, is in cupboards and the sink and on counters. I don't relish the job but it must be done, so I dig in and start cleaning. Howard is around somewhere. [BL]",Positive
I had gone into my bedroom but it wasn't like any bedroom that I've had in waking life. There were two light switches. I tried to turn on the lights but none of the lights would come on. The room was pitch black light. Just as in waking life I don't like to walk into a room that dark but I did anyway. I tried to turn each light on at the light source itself but none of them would come on. Matthew came to the bedroom at one point and I told him that I needed him to help me get the lights on.,Positive
"I was carrying a shallow black candle on some stairs.  My cousin Allen was behind me.  His parents my aunt Fiona uncle Logan were there, too.  We went to a bowling alley.  On the way I started rubbing Allen's crotch through his pants, showing him what I do with my boyfriend Jeremy, I guess.  My paternal step-grandpa Sal was at the bowling alley too.  Bowling balls were all around, under a blue light.  Two people took balls shaped like feet.  I couldn't find one with holes spaced correctly for my fingers.",Positive
"Crystal Meth Climber  I'm sitting with my mom and siblings at a table. My brother Wally talks about crystal meth and some other drugs. He says he is taking these drugs, just like that rock climber is, and he motions to his left where through a fishbowl lens I see a scene of a man climbing up a rock cliff. The table where I'm sitting with my family is near the cliff, at the height of the climber, who is about 50 feet from the top of the gray rock cliff. It's as if we are floating there viewing the climber. The climber swings along the cliff, pounding in stakes and pulling out other stakes. He takes a test by tugging on a rope and the rock that the stack was in crumbles. The climber hangs from a single stake, and lowers himself down slowly to get hold of the other stake. I'm afraid that he'll fall and die, because the one stake that is pounded in isn't in place securely. It seems that this stake may be attached to a single small shrub, which could pull out.",Negative
"I was at Max, Isobel and Eugene's (all from Roswell) house. I was helping with the gardening. There was this big container with plant pots in it. I didn't know much water to put in. Later there were plant pots near a shed. I thought I might water the grass. This frog had died in the container along with the plants. Their 'mother' gave us tea with superglue and sugar in it. Isobel was then at some place and had to distract this guy called Matt. She was hiding behind some bushes. I think they could change form too.",Positive
"I'm Fake Crying  I'm with my girlfriend Annie Thomas on the top bunk of a set of bunk beds. We're wearing very little clothing. She hugs me, and I hug her. She starts to cry. For some reason, I start to cry too. But I am faking the crying. I'm not really sad. I slip off the bunk bed in my fake despair and go out the door, and down the hall.",Negative
"Rich Karn's Motors  I'm on a Big Resort Area trip with some guys. We get there and are going to unload our gear. My junior high classmate Rich Karn has brought a gas engine and an electric trolling motor with a battery. The first thing I say to him is that he's hauling these on every portage! We have two boats for our trip. Both are Fishing Haven boats. One of them is wide boat. In the back of the wide boat there is a video screen of some sort. I'm at a cash machine. The guys in the boat fiddle with and rewind the video. I forget to withdraw my cash card. When they rewind the tape it scrapes the card. I go get the card. I've withdrawn a lot more than I need or want to have on me: $70. My grade school friend's father Myron Kasper's red van is related to the video: I see the red van driving forward and I think it should be backwards, because the tape is being rewound. My high school classmate Arnie Heller is there. He works for an outfitter. He has a Fishing Haven radio with and is going to do a 2:00 tow. I ask him if he'll give us a tow: just the one boat since the other has a motor. He says he was out last night, and implies he has a hangover, but says he can tow us after his 2:00 tow. My friend Nate Nelling asks Arnie if he can get a tow also. Arnie replies yes. Nate doesn't realize that the tow is for all of us.",Positive
"I was doing a fellow a favor with Joe A. We took the blame for a murder charge. We were supposed to be exonerated but the fellow who did it was a politician and was going to let it go, and we would be really guilty. Joe had an angle which would prove that the man framing was the guilty one. When this man found out, he put his henchmen on us. We went in flight and were chased and pursued. We ran and walked up hill and down thru cornfields of fodder, stocks. The pursuers were so close that they were about 100 ft. behind. They had swords. One of the swords fell down a small cliff. I picked it up and threatened the pursuers with it and they ran back. Then we went on our flight again thru cornfields, over a hill and then down. Now it was Bob, Jerry and I who were being pursued. I had my car parked in a big garage. There were other cars there. I told a woman, ÒLook at my car, how rusty it is, and at the holes in it.Ó I had another car. There it was, a new Lincoln. It was mine and still not. It started to back up and ran into a parked car, but just hit the bumper and did no damage. I saw a lot of beautiful pottery. I was swinging on a swing. I pulled myself up the rope, up the tree to where there was a caterpillar. He picked up some kind of small bottle and oozed out a white matter and it expanded like foam. Then a spider came out and put his jaws around the caterpillar, but didnÕt harm him. Peter A. was supposed to be in a hospital. Helen Solander was here and I talked to her. Bob and I were sweeping or cleaning up. I looked at the wallpaper. There were ash spots all over the walls and ceiling. I asked Bob who did that and he wouldnÕt say anything. So I said, ÒI know who did that. It was Jerry.Ó Jerry came in and I was getting angrier and angrier till I flew off the handle and I started to cuss and yell at Jerry. I told him to get out and stay away from here. As I was pulling myself up the rope, my little granddaughter was hanging onto me.",Negative
"The Creepy Crawly Hallway  I'm at the Redding farm. I'm in the southeast corner of the house in the baby room or in grandpa and grandma's old bedroom. I may be masturbating, or be about to masturbate: there is a sexual feeling. My brother Wally is there. I go upstairs in search of pornography. I walk in the upstairs hallway. My uncle Dannie Redding's old bedroom is barren. The hallway is dim or dark. Bats fly out of the small room across from Dannie's. There are spiders covering the walls and floors. Some of the spiders are large: bigger than my whole hand. Others are the size of a lemon. I only see the spiders when I get a glimpse of the light in the area, out of my shadow. I'm wearing gloves. I feel surrounded by creepy crawly critters. I crawl out of the area, brushing the floor as I go. I feel anxious, paranoid, and claustrophobic.",Negative

"I was awake in our house in PA. I went downstairs to put the lights off and in the front room I heard noises. I put out the lights and looked in and saw spooks moving around. I threw objects right at them, but it didn't faze them. One was coming at me. I made a sign of the cross and he disappeared. I closed the door and it pounded on the door. I heard noises in the house that sounded like kids running down the steps. Jack Delatt came in. He told me of two horses, but I can't remember them. He then went to bed. The bulb (light) was thick that we had in the hallway. Ann and I went downtown. Trixie followed us. I watched a car spin and skid, then jumped the curb into the other lane and then the driver started to skid because he drove too fast. I was lost in the post office downtown.

"I was driving a car following a fraternity brother of mine who was driving a yellow Pontiac convertible (actually his). We were on a dirt road. We came to a stop street. He went through. I was going to go through it too but suddenly got frightened and stopped. Just then a police car went by (an old Ford with Police written in gold on it). I thought to myself that Paul C.

"It almost feels as though I am in some kind of house associated with a university. I'm packing. Occasionally I will I don't know. It seems that Darren is there. I'm debating about having a conversation with him, that it's time for him to either move out or at the very least move into a different bedroom. He could tell something was bothering me and he asked me. I finally said, I'm just debating whether I want to have an unpleasant conversation with you right now. As I continued to unpack my closet is pretty full so I asked him if he had thought about either moving all of his things into the spare room or something else. He was not at all happy about that suggestion. There was something about Christmas decorations. Darren had been lying on the floor on his back while I was unpacking. He said something about if he could help. I said, You know, you've just been lying there while I have done all of this. I think it would be fair at least if you could get up and help with this. He got up and started putting his clothes on hangers. I was taking them and putting them in the closet of one of the guest rooms. All of his shirts he was putting on a hanger but he wasn't buttoning the neck button. So I was having to straighten and button. He had a girlfriend and his daughter Annie H.",Negative

"It was around 2.30am. I was watching an episode of Six Feet Under. I remember Claire and Nate, and Claire was a bit chubby. I was on my bed, reading a book in the dark. I had an ensuite and saw a creepy shadow. I went to Ezra's room and asked to sit on his bed and read. His door opened a bit later, but made no noise. Then a girl walked by and I tried to scream, but it was barely a squeak. I shut the door and locked it. She tried to open it (she was a ghost). Another one came and the door flung open. She had the shape of a cross on her face in blood. She was a 'star'. They said the star was 22 degrees and there was no nuclear thing, so couldn't develop water on them. I took her to the shop and I waited in the car. She got back and we had to wait at a set of lights to leave the carpark. I said she was worse than Dad to drive with, then said 'no, he's worse'. I was watching Spiderman or something. A guy found this ring to time travel with and James Franco found it and was using it.",Negative
"In a strange city lots of confusion; children playing noisily as we are about to go to a concert; I wonder if the kids should go as well and someone says ""It is good for them"" and they line up to go to the car where a composer friend of ours promises to take to the concert; I drive separately with a woman who is dressed in BLACK and when we arrive at the place where the concert is being held, we cant find anyone. We are LOST. Then I see the conductor come out and several people from the orchestra all dressed in tuxedos; we run down a steep incline, made up of red brick. Later I see our friend the composer who looks glum because I am told that his mother had died that nite away from home; I am sad about that. With Marissa Camden who tells me that her mother also died last nite and I say, ""Then we will have to have a DOUBLE FUNERAL... sad feeling.",Negative
"There were a bunch of army men sitting on top of a school desk out in the open. Several different kinds of army men. Someone told me those had been Chuck's army men. Chuck's mother said Chuck used to play out in the busy highway in front of their house when he was a little boy and he caused terrible accidents. Philip Martin said he was going to kill Chuck with the very pistol Chuck had traded for the army men. But when Philip went to shoot Chuck, the shot gun shells were too old and he didn't know how to re-pack them. The school lunch room was busy. It was just before lunch. It was the most hectic time. A lady worker asked me if she could have my orange. I didn't really want to, but I gave it to her. I was riding in a car with a sunroof with Elena. I wanted to hear. I was hearing the song. It was beautiful. Debussy. Claire de Leu (La Mer) and it went on for 2 hours. I was humming. There was an aluminum barn. Chuck was bammed on the outside doors of the aluminum barn the cows were in. They were getting mad and ready to stampede. A swinging gate went across and back against the fence (180 degrees). The little boy could fit between the fence and gate but the cows were gonna be mad! I showed William Chuck's army men. He loved them. My mother had planned a Christmas dinner party. Invited me, her and 3 guys she wanted to match me up with. She said she'd picked the seating arrangements by chance--over and over till they came out how she wanted. I started telling her about Chuck's army men and she walked away.",Negative
"I'm still working as a counselor. I have a daily appt. with this one group just before 5:00 quitting time. I give them a list of math problems and I observe them as they try to solve these unsolvable puzzles and that's the real test, how they deal with frustration. I give my ""father"" a test because he's curious about it. I think, ""This will be interesting to observe. I'll learn something about him."" He bites his lip and paces, very unhappy he can't figure it out. I explain to them they are gibberish for a reason, because it would be awful. In this volatile prison environment if some got the problems and others didn't, then the one who didn't get it would really feel stupid! Their self-esteem is already at a low. Some women teachers interrupt because it's past 5:00 and they come to collect their papers and things. I see a paper with a finger nail polish bottle attached to it. It belongs to one of the women. Another day I come to see a guest speaker working with the group. He's got a whole theory built around the shape of breads (rolls and buns) and the process of eating them. I listen as he talks about being real and connected with your feelings. The woman counselor sits next to me, very distraught and puts her head on my shoulder, weeping. It's too much to bear. He's fake, just like he's telling clients not to be. She cries, ""I can't bear it,"" and tries to nibble at my lower lip for security. I stop her because it's not appropriate.",Negative

"I was sitting in the backyard with a plate of scrambled eggs. I had forgotten to take the yellow part out so they were very dense. I had forgotten to stir them too. Then Dora came to the backyard and she had a plate of scrambled eggs too. She had taken the yellow part out and she had stirred them. Her scrambled eggs were light and fluffy. My mother called us to come in the house. Company was here. They came out on the back porch. I had been washing clothes. They were NOT folded, except the sarong I had gotten to give to Dora as a present. Dora. It was my birthday. Dora had a circle of rocket candles that go out and come back on when you blow them out. We just needed a cake to put them in. I blew them out. They came back on. I blew them out. They came back on. I blew them out and then you could see clear glass cylinders at the base of the rocket birthday candles. Ascending from the short glass cylinders was a wick in each tube. Then I understood how it worked. ""These clothes are a mess!"" My mother said. I said, ""The sarong is for Dora."" My mother said, ""Dora, your cart only has one hook and it won't stay on the ceiling. Merri's has 2 hooks and she only paid $7.99 for it."" I wished she would shut up.

"Later dream. I found a small monkey, miniature, really. He was given to me. He was in a bird cage, gold. There was glass so it was also like a fishbowl. It was dying because there was no air, food, or water. I opened a door in the glass to let in air. I could hear it hissing in and I could feel the flow of air into the cage. It was cold and ""mean."" I then got his food and water containers. I ""thought"" talked to it soothingly. ""Poor little thing. I'll bet you think I'm taking this away from you to hurt you, but see, I'm filling the cup and it's fresh. Now, here's the water. That's the most important, isn't it?"" The water cup then partially collapsed and the water spilled onto the food, but it was still O.K., just a little messy. Then I got nervous. I watched as the monkey changed. It was supposed to be cute and sit on my shoulder and chitter and be furry and hug me. I had held the door partially open with my keys (on a little sandal shoe), but the monkey was tiny, like a spider with a long tail. Then it was a small snake. I got really scared. The snake was growing and it was going to eat me, or kill me. It grew and I fled the room. I was on a road/freeway. There were many cars. I was in one. We were all fleeing the snake. It was huge now. The freeway was choked with cars. There was road construction and dust was thick in the air. I heard the screams of the others being killed by the snake. I felt fear and a certainty that this was it. No escape. The snake would get me. I looked to my left. The snake was on a moving train, devouring it and the people on it. I veered to the right and got out of the car, I tried to make myself very small and tried to burrow into the ground. I was burying myself alive to escape the notice of the snake. I felt doomed. It would find me.",Negative
There was a new movie with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Frost's last name was also Pegg (which wasn't 'real' but was like a nickname that had happened before they met). It involved time travel. When Frost was a kid he had a toy called 'Pegg' and it was something that he liked and that was how he got the name. Pegg went back in time to stop it and see what happened but he died and then it showed Frost as an adult 'die' and Pegg was upset and crying and everyone was saying it was like the most depressing movie ever.,Negative

"This dream was a series of vague and confused incidents, and I am sure there was much more to it than I can remember. I remember roller skating down a side walk in a rather unsteady manner, being conscious at the time that I could do much better than I appeared to be doing. Then I found myself in a car at the top of a hill with a middle-aged woman (I have no idea who she was). The woman was trying to park the car in front of her garage, but since the brakes did not work on the first two attempts, we rolled back down the hill both times--I was very frightened. The third time, however, the brakes held and we got out of the car. Then somehow or other I found myself in an amusement park with about four boys and girls my own age (I cannot identify them either). We seemed to be just standing around eating popcorn. Interpretation I cannot interpret this dream. Answers to questions 2. In the part with the car incident I felt very frightened when we were rolling down the hill backwards; in the other two parts I felt mostly just confusion.3. I was an actual participant.4.

"A bunch of extended family members were helping Aunt J move. The only ones I can identify, however, are Bruce W and at least two of his children. I know there others. Some of my siblings were there and my parents. We were outside of the front of the building. I don't know if it was a home or a condo. It doesn't seem to be an apartment. She had a large area in front that I would describe as a courtyard. There was a fence around it with an entry gate. Three of the corners, the two nearest the building and the one to the front, right as you face the building had square, concrete areas. On the one to the right and closest to the house she had placed some outdoor items like furniture, a flower pot, and a trellis. The trellis was about two feet high and four feet long. It had a green, flowering vine growing on it, yet it wasn't growing out of the ground or a flower pot. Some of what was there was a plastic chair and table for a child and at least one plastic chair for an adult. I think the flower pot was filled with dirt but didn't have a flower or plant in it. Aunt J had placed the things there haphazardly. The way they were placed there no one could sit in the chairs. The trellis seemed to be falling over. So I started moving things around, placing the trellis and then placing the furniture so the chairs could be used. My doing this prompted Bruce W to bring out other chairs of this same type. As he was doing that I was placing them on these three different squares of concrete, in a way that they would look nice. Some of the things that he brought out were in two pieces and needed to be snapped together. When I looked at some of them I didn't know what they were until he put one together. There were piles of each piece. I think some of the others started helping. I just kept going from square to square, placing them to try to make it look nice. He brought out so many of them that I didn't know what to do with all of them. I didn't know what I was going to be able to do with all of them and still make it look nice. Aunt J was sitting out there, just watching them. She was always the type to not let anything bother her, so she didn't really care how it looked yet she appreciated what we were doing and that we were making it look a little nicer. Later, I decided that I needed to call and talk to Bruce W. I was hesitant because I had never called him before or even having a conversation with him as an adult. I was also concerned about his wife answering the phone because that would make me even more uncomfortable. I finally went ahead and called and his wife did answer. I asked him for him and he wasn't there. She asked if she could help me. I told her no and that I just felt that I really needed to talk to him.",Negative
Matthew and I were doing something in his closet here at home and I noticed what appeared to be an opening into what might be an attic. Neither of us had noticed it before. I pushed the piece of wood that was covering the opening up a little bit and peered in. It was very dark. I decided to climb up there and see if there was anything up there. As I got further up there I realized that I had known about it. that I had forgotten that I even put a lot of stuff up there to store. It was a very large well-lit room and there was a lot of stuff up there. Lots of furniture and boxes and other stuff. I noticed several different antique pieces of furniture. There were some other people up there with me. I pointed out a couple of the antiques and said we could take those back downstairs and I could use them instead of buying the pieces I had been thinking about buying. At least two of them could be used as a dresser in the guest room though that was not their original use. I realized that I could also enter this space from ground level outside. maybe through my garage. I was going in and out this way now.,Negative

When I got all of them closed, the air stayed in the float or balloon. A fellow was parking his car. He drove away and I saw 22 pellets on the street. I picked them up. I also found a bb bullet, a tiny one. I pulled one pellet out of one of the bullets and then threw it down and it exploded. The boss told us to take some kind of material. It was paper or wood.

"There were zombies. They were fast and dangerous and had been around for a while. I ended up at this building, which was possibly a big school/college and realised there were people there, but they were bad. I heard them coming and quickly hid under this table. A zombie came in growling and I was trying to remember whether they sensed by smell or hearing, but a person came and took it away (it was like a 'pet'). I was sneaking around for some reason or another, but eventually they saw me and started going after me and shooting at me. I was running and climbing over fences and got back inside the building and ended up in this large gym area. There were lots of bits of furniture around (like bookshelves and such) and shelves along the top. I climbed up so that I was up high away from the zombies that began to pile in. A few people got bit and then I had a friend with me and we managed to climb down and sneak out and I pulled them into the toilet that was just next door. The door didn't close properly so I got her to sit against it and keep it closed. I found a button or something and pressed it and it flooded the place with water. Some bits of water leaked into the toilet, but it didn't flood. When it had finished, we got out and climbed along pipes and such to get out. Outside was all flooded as well - the streets were filled with cars and the water came up about halfway, there were also lots of hills and such to walk on. There were still plenty of zombies around and lots of animals. I remember seeing two animals running past us. We wondered what to do next.",Negative

"Tarzan  Tarzan is in the jungle. There's a bad leader and a strong bad man there. A dirty and dusty, solid, white BMW-like car pulls up to the small clearing where Tarzan is. Two South American-looking men dressed in shorts, shirts, hats, and boots get out of the car and walk into jungle empty-handed. I'm surprised at this, but I think they'll survive because others, including myself, have and do survive. The car is crowded, still. Tarzan tells a man, who may be the bad leader, that he should go into the car and Tarzan will meet him at the edge of the jungle at night. He says there will be enough light for them to make it. Tarzan then goes to the top of a tall tree, at the very top of which there is a bald trunk, broken off, with no branches. He stands on the top of the trunk, with his arms spread wide, and lets out his characteristic Tarzan yell. He then swings down, leaping and catching branches in a strong, sure-gripped manner. On his way down some men are in the tree. The men try to club and beat Tarzan. Tarzan evades the blows and beats the men, injuring them. Tarzan, the strong man, and the leader/manager are in a prison. Tarzan's hands are cuffed behind his back, and his is chained up facing the strong man. Tarzan and the strong man fight. The man head butts Tarzan, and Tarzan's face becomes red from blood. Tarzan rams the other man into a wall repeatedly. The man is facing a wall. Tarzan smashes his head into the wall repeatedly until the man is senseless. The fighting happens in a hallway outside a door with an automatic timed lock. The leader/manager and the strong man are put in the room behind the door, which is the prison. The door closes and makes the initial latch. Tarzan is still connected to the bad man by chains. When the door closes, the chains break. The manager tries to open the door when it starts to close fully. Two of his fingers get caught and are severed in the closing door. This door seems indestructible, and unstoppable. The bad strong man and the manager are in prison, and Tarzan is not.",Negative

I was also thinking of the photos I'd lost and the ones I'd taken of Eugene. Dad was doing some quiz on the internet for something. The window in Ezra's room had been taken off. I got a text from one of the guy's and a computer game had stingy requirements. His text said ""nice cats man, the next thing they lose is their skin"". I found a skull in the cupboard under the microwave and it looked fake, but it was real and it was Mittens's. I thought if Mittens was dead, then Tigger must be dead too and I was really upset.",Negative

The salesman to left, who wears a tie exactly like the one he wishes to sell, has hold of the customer's tie with is left hand, evidently to shape or adjust the bow.

"Older Group of Men  I am in a group of men who are older than I. We are going to do some sort of sport or recreational activity. They know and call me by my name.

"A man and I approach an Indian man seated on a bus. I offer him a $5 bill for something he did for me. He contemptuously slaps it out of my hand, hard. ""Do not offer me money. I don't want anything,"" he says. I look to the man (Howard, the drummer) and he smiles and shrugs. ""Offer to buy him a cup of coffee,"" he suggests. I do so.

"A guy had written Twilight. He decided he loved Alice so everyone thought he was going to bring her back to life in the next book [note: she didn't die in the book]. I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Buffy and Giles were acting weird and they leant in to kiss and someone entered the room and they backed off. I remembered in the last episode they had made out. The others left and Giles was locking the front door and closing the curtains and then Spike was there. He said ""Buffy"" and he thought something was going on. People were complaining about not knowing what Spike could do (without the chip).",Positive
"I am walking down the street and I see Marilyn. She has seen a display for candies, popcorn and pinwheels. She calls me over. She says, ""What fun! I want one of these."" I look them over and say, ""Well, I'm going on to the meeting. See you there."" I feel a little bad leaving her there alone because she was obviously inviting me to have this fun with her. I go on and start to go in a restaurant door and see I'm going into the bar side and go on to the next door and enter. I see my group several tables deep and ask one man to move a moment so I can get past him. He looks annoyed and doesn't want to move. So I say, ""OK,"" and go around the other way. Now I am going into the house where the meeting is and I am greeted by Carleen with a face mask of a grandmother. I laugh. Another woman enters with a mask and costume on. I say, ""Oh, no one told me this was a theme and we needed to bring masks."" More enter. They all have stylized faces (like in dance in movie Victor/Victoria. I go into living room. Carleen says, Just put your dessert there."" I feel badly because I didn't bring anything. I go on in and see some old easy chairs and grab one and start to scoot it closer to another woman who is scooting hers closer to me. We laugh and scoot back and forth. Then I notice my thumbnail on my right hand has like a fungus on it. I look underneath and it is like the sworls in an animal pad (foot) or like a big fungus that is on old dead trees. I start to peel it off. It's like bread crust on the heel of bread and squishy. I get it off; it is quite large. I put it in a plastic bag. It is kind of gross. A girl comes up, maybe 10 years old. There is some game getting ready to be played. I get up and go into the kitchen. I want to take my clothes off, maybe adjust my bra. I am headed for a back bedroom through the kitchen and get my top off before I get there. Leroy (my cousin) is in the kitchen doing dishes and he sees and smiles. I hold my top over my breasts and try to hurry through the door. I can't get it open and Leroy asks me to help do the dishes. I don't want to, but feel guilty; again, I'm not helping out.",Negative
"It was a black night and I was escorting a girl down Washington Street toward Haymarket Square. The buildings were dark, but the sidewalk was crowded. I was trying to keep I. and B. in sight as they pushed their way along in front of us. They hurried us uncomfortably. As rough men jousted us, my companion very simply put her gloved hand in mine. It pleased me very much. In fact, I seemed quite fond of her, though I did not know who she was and cannot identify her now. I think she wore a brown coat and I remember most vividly her tan colored glove with black stitching on the back. Suddenly here came a shock like a quick wakening, although I was not really awake, and lo, I was standing indoors, daylight was streaming through the windows, and in my right hand, which was still extended, were the fragments of a crushed coffee cup. I felt hurt and dazed.",Negative

Bob and my brother are with me, My brother wears a camouflage T shirt, We tramp through the jungle until we reach a great clearing, It is a great sloping field, much like those in the Watchung Reservation, My brother goes around the side on a small recon. Two G.I.s already at the bottom of a hill mistake him for VC and direct fire at him, I hail them off, but it is too late. I see my brother being hit. Another GI from behind is also shooting at my brother. From fifty meters I hit him with a sustained burst from my M-16. The bullets wind through the air, arcing like artillery shells. Bob grabs the fellow I have wounded while I go to the aid of my brother. We take them both to a nearby hospital, which resembles my childhood grammar school. The doctor acts quickly, taking the wounded into the operating room, we go back, as there is nothing left for us to do. A fellow who I dislike intensely, another medic, sallies up on horseback from behind us and jeeringly announces that my brother is dead. I am heartbroken and begin weeping and sobbing, Then I turn around and with the strength that comes from great anger grab the horse by its throat and half wrestle it to the ground. My lamentations grow softer, until the mourning feeling is all but gone. As Bob and I return to the hospital we must cross a street. The area resembles the neighborhood of my childhood. A policeman halts an oncoming car that I have waited to let pass. The dream ends with an intense feeling of loss.",Negative

"Changing the Lock on a Bank  I'm outside a bank. I'm trying to change the lock from the inside of the door to the outside.

He comes out and catches me changing the lock. I have four things: a screwdriver, a hammer, a deck of cards, and a vinyl envelope. He takes the hammer and the envelope. I tell him to give me the hammer. He say no, because I was using it to break in. I said I wasn't, but he doesn't believe me.  The bank is a hardware store. I tell the man it doesn't matter if he believes me or not because I wasn't using it. He gives it back to me. I tell him he's going to have a good dream because he gave it back to me, and then I sprint away.",Negative

We stop and she gets out and tells me to hold the reins. I do, but the horse won't mind me and keeps creeping forward, no matter how hard I pull on the reins. Then we see a big barn that has a garage sale going on inside. Now it's a small dog at the end of the long reins, dragging me around the store. I see books, videos, record sets.

"Oh, I smell coffee somewhere! Okay, last night I had kind of a crazy dream. I dreamt that I was in the Bancroft Middle School cafeteria, and people were getting ready to like take a test, like a SCAD or something, and they were all sitting at the table. And over in a corner my Mom was shoveling big plops of poop into a bucket, and I don't know where that came from, but she was saying, ""Getting the dirty stink out of the cafeteria would help them take their tests."" Well, duh! And then I must have been roaming around Westport High School or something, in the hall in front of the Guidance Office, and I heard them announcing the final exam schedule for Westport College over the intercom. And I was thinking how the high school students, they threaten them and they say, ""If you don't get your exam by the scheduled time, the door's going to be locked and you won't get to."" And they just say, ""First period, second period, go to your next period exam."" But at Westport College, when they read their exam schedule, they were a lot more, not really empathetic, but sort of along that line, trusting that the college students would know what the heck they were doing. And that's all I can really remember about this dream.",Positive
"I was at my birth home and had called some landscaping specialists to come and trim my geraniums, though I don't know why they would be mine. They had grown as tall as the house and had grown into the gutters, like between the gutters and the roof in some cases. One of my brothers or sisters walked up and I explained what was going on. Using my hands I showed them how big around some of the stalks had grown. They were 3-4 inches in diameter. There were so many men there working on this I couldn't keep my eye on all of them at once. Some of the workers were on the roof working and some were on the ground. They were also on various sides of the house. I went to the end of the house where Mother and Daddy's bedroom was and saw that they had cut down a dogwood tree there. I was extremely upset because they weren't supposed to do that and I had no idea why they did. It was not nearly as tall as the house and there was no way that it could be interfering with the gutters. I asked someone about it and they tried to tell me that it would be causing a problem soon and that's why they cut it down. I was very upset and didn't believe them. There was a small Maple tree nearby and I was very stern in telling them not to touch it, to leave it as is. One of my brothers walked up and I told them what happened. I was so afraid of what Mother or Daddy would say about the Dogwood being cut down. I kept walking around the house, watching what they were doing and talking to other siblings that were there. I used my hands to show someone else how big around the Geranium stalks were. I was very nervous that they were going to cut the small Maple tree down as well.",Negative

After one performance some men and I went to Higbee's for dinner, only the restaurant wasn't really that of Higbee's. One of the men (who was my baby doctor) told me to get a job selling at Higbees, but I was very indignant when I told him I was a college graduate and wouldn't sell at Higbees. Then we returned to the scene of the show and bunch of girls and I were in a bedroom or dressing room. Tony Martin and his wife came in and Mrs. Martin had dull red hair and red lipstick on. Mr. Martin's hair was coal-black and I told him her really shouldn't bleach his hair black because men with gray hair, especially those gray at the temples, were very distinguished looking.",Negative
"I was out late. I met a guy who said he had a classic vintage bottle of wine - a very famous one. The trouble was, he said, he had opened it a while ago, poured one glass, then re-corked it.

I took it 'home' (which in the dream was a cluttered wooden house) and opened it in the early hours of the morning. It smelt absolutely rancid.",Positive

If I fall, then I'll just be dragged around by the others, most painful. The British guard sees how well I'm doing. He calls me ""Andrew"" and puts me at the head of the line. I am challenged and want to show how good I am at this. I call out orders to the others and in precision, we go up and down stairs and duck obstacles. Later, I'm walking in a park (free of bread). I see Sylvester the Cat. I call to him. He is nervous. He comes over to be petted and then goes on his way. I walk on. I look for a bathroom.  I find one. The door isn't there so I get a poster, and write a message to Howard and tape it to cover the door area. I see raspberries and packages of perfume in the toilet. I look at the package.

I wanted to run into the house where she was staying, but something was preventing me. My feet just couldn't move because all the people were shouting and calling me names. They told me not to go.

We found the right one. The guy came over to use the knife to do something. He then walked back and said something implying that a bum had been a murderer. He still had the knife so I suspected him and pointed it out. He came at me but I got a knife and stabbed him. Calvin was there and a girl who I hated and who hated me. Calvin went another way and there was a big open area with a window to the sea. I went on a balcony and looked down at the bottom floor. I could see a little bit of water lapping at the shore. The girl was annoying me so I grabbed her and slammed her against the wall and threw her to the floor. I ran before her other friends could do anything. There was a game with locked doors everywhere that were techy looking. People started coming so I grabbed a gun and hid in a cupboard. They came in and I shot and killed them all.",Negative

I went in and everybody was there. They are eight children, but nobody paid attention to me. I started to talk to someone and at that point I got up. I passed by Chiqui and I remembered, I went to where she was sitting and on my knees and hugging her from the back. I sang Happy Birthday in her ear. I wanted everything to go well.

"My sister Lydia shows me her wound from surgery on her hip. She says, ""You may not want to see it. It's pretty messy."" I hesitate and then Mirabelle and I look. It is hard to look at, lots of bloody gauze bandages and so on. Then I look up at the window and see lots of drips of water coming off the top window casement. Then I see it is blood, probably from Lydia's wound. It is dripping past the bleeding heart plant hanging in the window and I comment, ""How ironic, eh?"" My parents are gone this evening looking for a washer and a dryer for me. Spooky things happen. I feel a bit scared. Finally they return and they say they already took the machines to E City, that's what took them so long. We'd been doing laundry all night, which is part of why the lights went out and scared us.",Negative
"I was sitting in someone's home in the living room. Nothing was familiar. There were about eight men and women there, none of whom I recognized with the exception of a girl I know about 23 years of age. We were all sitting watching home movies when suddenly this girl pulled out a pistol and shot one of the middle-aged people in the center of the forehead. Everyone was surprised but they did not know who had committed the crime. The dream then ended.",Negative
"Funny Looking Drill Sergeant  I'm working at a table. There is a superior to me eating dinner nearby. It may be my brother Wally. I sneak away and go up some stairs where a lot of guys are working sending coolers down a chute. I join in, after ""Little Man"", who is a fellow chicken catcher. I am supposed to slide my cooler or move the conveyer belt faster so there isn't much room between his cooler and mine. The coolers are short, fat jugs with small caps, filled with liquid, maybe frozen.  I am in an army-like situation. My friends Nate Nelling and Tony Kramer are there too. We have an okay group leader; he is not too tough. We are all sitting at a long table and a drill sergeant and his sidekick come in. The sidekick is short and scrawny. The sidekick barks orders at me. I have to hold my hand and arm straight up. He pushes me and I tip, but my body and arm stay rigid. I flip over and over as he pushes me over tables and benches. I tough it out. I think Nate and Tony probably feel bad for me. On the last flip I end up standing upright on the desk next to our telephone. The sidekick sergeant is on the floor in front of a china cupboard. I decide not to conform to all the army stuff. I jump down and land a blow on him. I beat the shit out of him. The real drill sergeant, a biff-like crew but stocky fellow, comes over. He's wearing gray, and has a few missing teeth. I can't hurt him. I punch him, but he is like a rock. He can do some serious damage to me.",Negative
Elsie had come and we went to a neighbor's and talked with her in the kitchen. She brought out cards with messages on them. The second was from Coa. Asking for me to call them. They wanted to take us to Barber's Point. I said we'd better go home to phone and we left. We went across the street and then down but I couldn't see. Realized I had gone over with sleep shade on pushed up and felt embarrassed. Now it had slipped down and I stumbled and bumped into someone.,Negative
"I asked Nate and Whistle which horses they would take from a list of 9 I had on a card that I picked from the entries. I went to bed and tried to dream which one or ones would win and Whistle said #3, which was Point Barrow and Nate said #1, which was Penny Achance. I was walking along barefooted with Bob and Audrey. We came by a small puddle of water and there were a lot of water bugs in it. Audrey told me to walk thru it, but I said, ""No, those bugs are all germs."" Then we were up in a tree with Kotnik. He put a rubber tube or hose in his pants and there was dirty, muddy water coming out of his body thru the hose into a tube beside him. The tube was full. He turned the hose on me and got my pants dirty and wet, then he turned it on Bob and got his face all muddy. I didn't like it. I cleaned Bob's face and we got off the tree and were going to get the car to go home. I called Audrey, but she stayed in the tree with Kotnik. Then I saw Bill Kotnik again draining himself of the mud again. I stopped at a gas station and the fellow wanted me to go to the left of the station to the gas tanks, but I said, ""I can't get in there; it's too narrow."" He wanted to bet me I could, so I said, ""I'll bet you $55, no better $1000, that my car can't get in there,"" but he changed his mind. Later I proved to him it couldn't get in the narrow space. I drove my car to the edge of a cliff and stopped on time. It was dangerous.",Negative

"I dreamed that I had a bath towel over my shoulders and that by flapping the towel I could fly like a bird. Several times during the dream I took off from the sidewalk and ascended to the height of a house. After circling around the street I would land safely and try again. Although I never fell, I was worried that the ""wings"" would fail me once in the air. Above the street was a mass of telephone wires, communication wires, and electric streetcar wires. In flying up from the sidewalk I had to get through all these wires and was therefore extremely anxious that I would become entangled. At the end of the dream I was roller skating down the street with a gang of kids after me.",Negative

The board table is at the far end, raised a bit, I guess it's on a stage or riser, and takes up almost all of that space. The rest of the room has folding chairs in it and they seem to be all filled. This room is pretty crude, as though it's in one of those temporary buildings you see at churches and schools. Flimsy siding and panelling, cheap doors, etc. I'm supposed to be at the table though I'm not at all comfortable about it - perhaps I'm a sub for somebody else.

I say, ""And so now I am going back to high school."" They laugh with me. I say, ""To learn math."" Tyler says, ""Calculus.""

"I had witnessed a murder by a gang. Mom got me and Ezra to stay with some friends that were high up in the drug world. We settled in well. One day I went into an office and was talking to them and someone turned on the police scanner and they heard they were coming to this street and going door to door pretending to be a charity. They quickly hid us in a basement. There was a window with blinds and Ezra opened it a little but I told him not to. There was a lady in sunglasses. A guy was naked and standing in front of a window. Then we were actually in a car and under a seat. There were 4 cars. The lady thought something was up and opened the car next to us and there was a guy in it and was confused. She said she was as cop and he pulled a gun out to shoot and she shot him first. He died and this other guy came out and shot her. There was a big shoot-out and everyone died. Ezra and I got out and decided to run home. There were police sirens in the background. I got my phone out and took photos. The house was on fire and there was lots of smokes. We ran and I took more pictures. We got home and Mom was there. I said 'they're dead, everyone's dead'.",Negative
"I was watching a movie which was kind of dull, but it was also somewhat hard to follow and it didn't really wrap anything up until the end. It was kind of a thriller and at the end, this old guy (about 50-60) who we thought was the bad guy confronted this guy at a speech he was giving and it was implied he was actually the good guy. I was then in a room on one of the top storeys of this building in a city with the other main characters and a lady was like 'oh no' and I moved to look out the window and saw a mushroom cloud. A shock wave hit and we saw a building start collapsing. Some people started climbing out of this building onto another one that it was connected to, but we decided to stay in here and wait. But the building started to sway and the room began to collapse. We tried to climb out the window and then somehow ended up in the ocean or a pool.",Negative

My eyes first take in her hair. It is in the upswept style she is fond of, in which her long hair is rolled around a ""rat"" at the back of her head. It gives fullness and body to her hairdo.

"There was an online activity up on the University site. I had to put an 'option' subject but they were all lame. I went to University. I parked in an underground carpark which was creepy and there was an elevator like the elevators in Super Mario. This teacher guy read out the new subjects. The ones on at good times were mostly taken. There used to be a Beatles one. Most of them were physical. Dexter's (Dexter) boss or something was called Principal Banshee (and was the principal from Glee). Dexter was in a carpark and he turned and saw something and screamed like a girl. Debra (Dexter) and someone saw and he pretended he was going crazy. I was thinking that I didn't pick up on the 'banshee' reference before. I went to class and realized that I hadn't re-straightened my hair. Then I had a boyfriend and we had a room there. We were in bed making out, he was on top, and then we had sex. Then I was at Nana's. I was trying to find my way to the carpark. I went around the back and there was a big hole and I felt like I was going to fall. They were putting a deep pond in. Poppa and others were working on it. Nana helped me around. I went around to the front of the house. Fido was there with a big snake. It snipped at us and Nana told it off. There were more snakes and she was trying to get rid of them and I went to go back and Darren and Ezra were there and in the way. Then I was watching Dollhouse, which was different. I remember Boyd. There was a face on a logo with something in the mouth -- ""a bird"" and she had big blue eyes. There was a dead bird which didn't have a disease in its leg, whereas most did. Then I was back at Nana's. I watched Firefly bloopers. Zoe and someone were on a webcam and a 'trial version' came up. Wash was on the other end.

I decide to clean this stuiff up and I find a broom and a garbage can and I am scooping up masses of steamy smelly maggots and carrying these things over to the garbage can and so on and I'm trying to get things cleaned up and finally I get some other people interested and we decide we are going to throw away the old bed and the old clothes and get things cleaned up and dusted up and make it more useful.",Negative

"I was talking to someone about a woman who goes into the gym through the back entrance. intended for employees. No one ever questions her because of her physical condition. They assume she is an employee because she is in such good shape. I don't know why it would be considered sneaking in because going in the back simply meant you could get by without showing your membership card. I think a lot of members go in that door, including myself. In fact, the next time I went I entered through that door. I went into a back corner of the locker room and put my things into a locker. The locker room was kind of like a maze in that it had several aisles and some of them turned to enter other aisles and others were dead ends. Twice I turned from my locker to go out to the gym and found myself at a dead end. Another member, a man, noticed me do this and I said to him that I keep forgetting the way out. I pointed in the direction that I needed to go. I realized then that I was also in the men's section of the lockers so I got my things and moved them over to the women's lockers. Again, I went to a back corner. There was something(s) hanging over the locker I chose. Maybe a few hangers with shirts on them. I simply brushed them to the side far enough to get the locker open and put my things in. I decided to go out front and get a key for the locker. This was also something that a member would do on their honor if they came in the back entrance. something that other woman doesn't do. There's an image of her doing something but not in the typical gym setting. it's almost as though I'm seeing her perform some kind of acrobatics. maybe in the air. I'm noticing her physical shape and thinking that she is in good shape but I'm still not sure why people are, or would, make such a big deal about it. or mistake her for an employee. I went out to get a key for the locker. There is an employee standing at a podium at the entrance to the workout area. She asks to see my membership card and I tell her I forgot and left in my locker and that I'll go get it. As I turn to do that she stops me and I think she is going to get a key for me anyway but she is pushing things around on the podium looking for something in particular and doesn't seem able to find it. When I go back into the locker room I notice that there are a lot of people in there now, and it seems to be both genders. There is something set up now that I think are supposed to be massage tables, but they appear to be made of black steel legs and frames with natural-colored wicker making up the rest of the table.

I remember I screamed but nobody paid any attention to me or the person I choked. If I remember correctly, they went right on talking and laughing. The next thing I remember was running down what seemed to be stairs that never came to an end. Then I tripped and fell headfirst down the stairs and woke up with that falling through space sensation. Interpretation I was at a party that night, but I knew all the people. There were actually only about six or eight of us there.

"Jo V , Jan F and a friend of theirs had come to visit me. I think I had gone out for a walk and when I was coming back I saw Jo V getting in her car getting ready to leave. Her friend was standing at the passenger side, I think saying good-bye. Jo V had her window down. At first I just waved and kept walking, then realized she might be on her way back home or maybe I wanted to find out where she was going. I went over to the car and leaned in through the window and gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Someone said something about her not going out much, or not going out at all to do anything while she was there. I'm not sure which of the three of us said it. I didn't make a big deal about it because I know Jo V likes her time alone. But I also know that when her and Jan F come to visit they do usually go out and do something. Now I'm standing with Jan F and the other woman in front of one of their cars. Jan F is checking her oil. I said something to Jan F about the fact that her and Jo V did not go out anywhere during this visit. She looked at me, kind of sideways - turning her head slightly down and to the left - look at me from the top of her eyes. She said that her and Jo V are thinking about breaking up over this. I said I recognized that it was unlike the two of you not to go out during your visit. It seems that this third person is part of the problem though also.

Two tens, twenty-eight twenties and a $14 bill with (a picture of) millions of New Yorkers. She said, ""Leave or I'll shoot."" I had to squirt the fire hose uphill to wash the bubbles out of the grass. Then the boss lady said, ""I had 3 men working for 4 days and had to shoot them with cyanide sulfide. CLEAN UP THESE BUBBLES AND CYANIDE. Count the $4000. Two of them have the day off.""",Negative
"I had to take an exam in the psych lab. When I entered, there were tables over the whole place. The lab was just one room, not the way it actually is. There were chairs along the wall all occupied with people who are proctors. There seemed to be more of them than students taking the exam. One girl, a student from Guilford house, was one of these proctors who had a bright blue outfit. She was sitting with her legs crossed and her head supported in her hand which in turn was resting on her knee. Another proctor had on a coat with a wide green band on the bottom and then fur. As I came in the lab, I remarked to whom I was with, that there are more people to see that we don't cheat than there are kids taking the exam.",Positive
"I was watching The X-Files. Mulder and Scully were at a house. I was with Scully. There was a dressing table and some glasses on top. I put them on and then I could see the mother, grandma and daughter who lived there and were dead. I freaked out and Scully didn't believe me. Then the grandma was going to kill herself to save the girl and the mother was crazy. I cried a lot. There were some cheap houses in Seaside and I said that I wouldn't live in Seaside. Then we were in groups and there were beds in one room with no room to walk. I was with Ezra and we were using a picture to map the beds.",Positive
"It was raining in my dream and I was coming out of the hospital going over to another building. I remember that as I was running across I noticed the long line of people standing in line, out in the rain waiting to be seen by the doctor in the out patient Dept. Some were older men and women, and as I entered the hospital I remember feeling upset and despairing about seeing them out in the rain, waiting patiently. I thought that certainly other arrangements could be made for these people. Interpretation I have recently had more contact with the hospital, which I haven't had for some time and I often times have to go through the clinic to go home at night and I see patients waiting patiently and hopefully. It usually leaves me uneasy, for a line of thought about their social and economic and health status goes through my mind and I feel often times that life is so hard and such a struggle for some.

"There were cats in the bathroom, hiding. I heard a noise and I followed it. It was coming from under Dad's bed. Ezra said there was a cat under there. Cuddles was under there. I went to my room and put her on my bed. I saw a dark green/black snake like thing slithering under my stuff on the floor. Poppa and Dad were out the back and I asked them how to kill it. I described it and they freaked out. Poppa, in which I think was an attempt to get me to leave the house, asked if I wanted food and I said ""No, Mom's getting it for me"". I thought it was Sunday and that Mom had to do my hair, but remembered it was Friday. There were some people filming a music video on a beach and the snake was around.",Negative
"Prior to awakening there was no deep dream, just like thoughts, scenes idly passing by. Just before awakening I was myself standing sort of like in front of a mirror with self-evaluation, being self-evaluated. At first I was in praise, and then I saw myself for what I really was. In other words, it was a dejected feeling afterwards. I don't seem to be able to recall anything that was going on before or after. I safely can say I was awakened just after, I think almost immediately after this thought. I can't give any action that happened previously or immediately after this incident. There doesn't seem to be anything I can tie it in with, just like I say possibly an idle thought.",Negative
"I had decided to purchase a condominium. I think I found one advertised in a large hardback book. It was about the size of a large dictionary. The community had a specific name so I got out a map and looked up the name. The weird thing is that it described it but it was also the name of the community. I went there and walked into a sales office. There was a woman working there that was about my age or maybe a little older. She was very thin, had blonde hair and wore glasses. She was the only one working. Initially she didn't say anything to me though she had glanced up at me but then kept working. Finally she did look up. I told her I was there to look into the condo that was for sale. She got her keys and took me to see it. I think we just walked. At first I was unsure. We had to go upstairs to enter the front door. She was telling me that my neighbor was an older woman with MS. She said I would hardly ever see her but that there is one person who comes frequently to see her and help to care for her. I would see that person but otherwise she was a good neighbor because she is quiet and does not have a lot of people coming in and out etc. Where you enter was kind of like a covered patio outdoor area. There was a sitting area. It had some roses there that were dying. I thought I could try to save the roses. I thought it would be a nice area to sit and read and such. The woman then showed me another area. We looked over or through or something to an area that was an outdoor area that was not covered. It seems as though we had to look through some wood slats to see this area. This area was about the size of a car. The floor was wood and not level. It had a high slope. I couldn't figure out what it was and I don't remember what she told me. Underneath it was storage and she said a basement. I asked her if I could see it. She told me I could but we went inside first. As soon as we walked in the front door I knew it was the place that I wanted though right now I can't remember anything about the inside or why I knew it was the place for me. She showed me around. I was carrying this big book with me that had the condo listed. I also had my checkbook and a pen with me. I set those down on the kitchen counter I think while we looked around. After we finished looking around the inside I told her I was pretty sure this was the place that I wanted but I wanted to see the basement first. There were some maintenance men there. I asked her how soon it could be available for me to move in and she said two weeks. She said the maintenance men would need that much time to get it ready. This is unusual for a condo unless the owners hired these men to do some work. One of the maintenance men was taking me to see the basement. I was wearing a somewhat short skirt. We had to go down a wall ladder. I was nervous about going down this ladder anyway but especially in this short skirt. He went down first and then held out his hand to help me down. I think I handed him my book and checkbook and pen. Then I went down. I remember asking someone or saying to someone that it didn't seem that there were many families with small children in the community. They smiled and chuckled and said no there weren't families with young children in the community. They said it was mostly people my age and ten or 15 years younger or older. Someone asked me about my son. I said he was 18 and I told him he was a student at PLU. I don't know if I said he was a junior.",Negative
I had a concert to go to. I got there and it was in a small room. The ban was called K'Um. I didn't know any of the songs except they played 1985. I wondered why I paid $100 to see this.

A little girl dressed in white was on her way to the party. We went inside and there was whiskey and pop. I got a large glass, double header glass full of whiskey. I spilled it into the sink and rinsed it out. I put some whiskey and coke and water, then milk into a glass and I drank it and it was good. It really went down and the whiskey was not sharp. We sat outside and all at once heavy black; some came our way and it had a bad odor. The smoke cleared and I saw a fire. They were burning off old cable. A fellow asked me how high the smokestacks were. They were about a mile away. I took a good look at them and there was a ladder leaning on one of them and it reached to the top. I told the boy the stacks were about 250 ft. high. I looked into the sky and I saw two planes flying. They looked like two planes. They bumped and one fell to the earth.

Something happens with sodium chloride and sugar: maybe burning the man's penis with the sodium chloride. Something is happening with pop stars. Janet Jackson's music video ""Control"" is on. Something may happen with a mean dog.",Positive
"I got a video of 'The Murder of John Lennon'. It was different from what actually happened though. It was all real video and everything had been taped. There was a part of the movie about these people from the future. One of them was bad at math, but was good with decimals. They knew that he was getting killed on 8th December at 8.00pm though it changed to 10.00pm. They were out partying and they got reminded of saving him ten minutes before it was going to happen. John Lennon was taped talking to people after he had just got off a boat and it was daytime. Then shown was John signing Mark David Chapman's book to 'Peter Milk'. Then he came back later and one of the people there cried out ""Look out!"". He mumbled it as if questioning it and then turned around to see Chapman standing there with his hand in his jacket. It was cold and you could see their breath. He pulled out a gun and said ""I may be gay but you are great,"" and as John turned to run he shot him and he said ""I'm shot,"" and collapsed on the stairs [when he fell the camera was actually him falling, like in A Clockwork Orange when Alex jumps out the window]. The stairs he collapsed on came down upon each other and John got squished. By the time, Yoko Ono and the others got there he was long gone. His feet were sticking out and the last part showed Chapman going through files about him. I was watching it with Mom and our eyes were both teary. She went away and I watched it again. I was really upset and crying. Mom said ""I understand but get over it"". [I woke up from this dream crying, and was really depressed for the whole day.] Later I was somewhere else and this dude asked if anyone liked any celebrities that had died before we were born. Mom said ""She [me] does!"" and he asked me when. I said ""Ten years, four months after August 7 1970"" and he couldn't work it out. He was the decimal dude.",Negative
"I was in my house, in the basement. I was closing up the house. No one else was there. I felt as if I were escaping from something. There was a kind of mechanical contrivance which resembled a bicycle, which I crawled around and through. I became partially entangled in it, then escaped. Then I got on a very tiny railroad handcar no larger than a toy and began to pump furiously. Somehow it was large enough to hold me, but I got nowhere. The track took me right back to where I had started. Then I had a feeling of having made my escape and was sneaking off through the dark. I went out through a window in the garage. I closed it behind me and wanted to lock it to keep out robbers, but I couldn't. I was anxious to get away, and I left the vicinity.",Negative
"I was reading a book. I read a part in it before but it had a different ending. There was this shelter and the lady was like ""just one more person"" and this old guy started walking up these steps, slowly. Then this old lady came and walked fast and the lady said that the guy was first and she said ""you didn't say till when"". She let the old guy in and then he died. I don't remember what happened in the other book. Then I was in some class. Dmitri and others were reading comic books. I was doing something with batteries and magnets. Mr Stevenson dropped some Yu-Gi-Oh! comics on my desk and told me to read them.",Positive
"Am in a stamp store waiting in a line of about six people to buy stamps. Appears to be a confused double line and next to me is a small and abnormally fat man, looking extremely uncomfortable. A man standing roughly in front of me appears to be a friend of fat man. The fat one gets annoyed with someone standing behind him and he then passes in front of me and stands with his friend. I feel sorry for the little guy. Later I have only one person in front of me, as a stranger walks in and stands close to front of line, near me, waiting to cut in when merchant and first man are through. This annoys me and I follow the transaction closely so I can cut in and command merchant's attention before stranger cuts in.",Negative
"I was communicating with Reid W or someone about following up with all of the people who have said they were going to participate but I had not received payment from them yet. One of them in particular was Kendall B. I was feeling uncomfortable about that one because he is my mentor. Someone brought to my attention that he has another book. He may have been the one that told me about it. The new book was called ""Twice as much, but half as many.""",Negative
"It seems that I was both at Castleview Mall, and that I was going to Castleview Mall. So I'm not sure which it really was the traffic was bumper-to-bumper were driving in a very dangerous manner, and I may have been guilty of this myself as I may have made some kind of the name change or something that was dangerous. Maybe I changed lanes without using my turn signal or without there being in a room or both. It was dangerous for both me and for others, even though I ended up in the lane that I wanted or needed to be in. At one of the intersections there was someone directing traffic. I was preparing to turn right. I wasn't sure if I needed to wait for him to direct me to turn right or if I could go ahead. There were two right turn lanes. I was in the right hand of those two lanes there was a car in the lane to my two that went ahead without waiting for the traffic director to give us the go-ahead. At the same time that I decided to go ahead, the traffic Director waived us on. I had an appointment with Terry D. When I arrived, I saw that Jennifer C was working for him. I was very bothered by this. Certainly, even though he knew how I felt about anything related to CAS, he had no obligation not to hire her, simply because of me or my feelings. His office looked very different in the dream than it does in waking life. I was sitting in the reception area. On and off Jennifer C and I were talking casually. While I was waiting, Terry was cleaning a bathroom in his office. I watched him walk back and forth past the open door with different things for cleaning. Initially I was surprised to see this but then I remember him saying something to me once about cleaning his home in his tendency to be very meticulous. He said that at times he has to tell himself just get it done, rather than being so meticulous. There was something about orange slices related to him cleaning the bathroom. At first I thought that was very odd, but then I realized how many ""orange"" or citrus cleaning or household products there are on the market today. I had met a man on a blind date, and I was debating whether or not I should see him again. He happened to be coming by Terry's office to meet him. Three was going to help us decide if we should go out again to try to get to know each other. He was going to help us determine if there was much chance of us really having a successful relationship that would make another date worthwhile. I didn't tell Terry anything in advance about this man. I didn't give him any physical description. This man was a very large man. I'm guessing he was close to 7 feet tall. I would estimate him to be at least eight to 12 inches taller than Terry. He had an athletic build or medium build, not necessarily athletic. He didn't look overweight, but he was also not a small frame or thin man. Terry seemed a bit surprised when this man arrived to meet with him. He was surprised by his height. It seems that there was something else distinguishing about this man that I wondered how Terry would react to and that I was questioning myself. It might be that he was a black man. It almost seems that on my first date, he was a black man, but then when he came to meet Terry he wasn't. Maybe it was some other nationality, like Spanish or Indian. The three of us sat down to talk. Terry was doing something as we talked while I was just sitting there. This man seemed to be, maybe he was sitting alone on the sofa, because he seemed to be resting on his left elbow, in a semi reclining position. He and Terry were doing most of the talking. The first thing Terry said alluded to my anger issues. There was something related to anger. The man said, so basically what you're telling me is that she is a bomb ready to go off. I really bristled at this. I didn't like it at all. Terry said yes, that's basically what I'm saying. He started to explain. His explanation was that I really wasn't that severe. I finally spoke up and said, while looking at this man, the fact is that. I don't like people to be mad at me or not like me. So, if I do get angry with someone I can not express it for fear that they will get angry with me or not like me. Even in a healthy way. Terry said yes, exactly. Implication here is that if I don't express my feelings at the appropriate time and in a healthy manner, it could build up and that could lead to an explosion. I was in a store like Wal-Mart or target. I am walking around the household product Department. There is a couple there with their child. One of the shelves on each side of each aisle was very tall. The space between the shelves was approximately 3 feet or more. The store stocked boxes of laundry detergent that were that big on those shelves. This couple had a favorite brand that they were looking for. The store was out of stock. They were discussing this, and finally decided to get a smaller container of another brand. Although they were very reluctant to do this, because they didn't believe that it could possibly be as good as their favorite brand. I was looking for my brand but I don't know that I found it. I was also looking for another department in the store. I don't know now what that was. It's kind of like I was thinking about how something is typically done related to one particular aisle in stores in general. When I say particular aisle I mean the type of product that is typically stocked there. There was either a repetitive element or a testing element to this.",Negative
"I have asked R. to my hotel so that she too may see Luther and his wife. Had to remake bed because the maid has put the brown and white spread, I use as a mattress cover on top of the blankets. Just as finishing, R. says it must be their auto that has just driven up. I look out can't turn the Venetian blinds so as to see but do see soon after about a dozen tourists coming up the stone steps. Then Luther and Roselle come in. Roselle tells of her planned trip home via Europe. I ask what about Luther and their son. She says their son will stay with Luther. Just then the clerk brings in three tourists who will sleep in my room. I hurry in and see that they have pushed in two beds, moved mine, added green curtains. I protest but she insists my room is larger than hers. Go to talk to Luther some more, bothered because his wife's name is really Frances. The waiter brings in trays for the tourists. I ask if regular residents are not expected to eat in the dining room. He says, ""Yes."" Wonder if I can take 2, no 3, because R. is there too, guests with me. When I have asked because it's 5 p.m. nearly time to eat. Then I wonder if when making the  tourist's beds, they used my blankets and go to see. Look in the beds and in the second one find two blankets, pull them out, thinking I will not remake the bed. Tell the tourists at least they must not sit in my room. but in the common rooms and go downstairs to tell the management. Suddenly I have no clothes on but the blankets are cover enough to go downstairs. I am outdoors, my room is on the 4th floor but I stop on the first to complain and insist on a refund.

"I was staying with Patrick for the summer. It wasn't his house, though. It was way out in the middle of nowhere, and his parents weren't around. He could drive (he backed out of the driveway at 50 mph), but we both rode mountain bikes to some dimly lit store where he wanted to buy a wooden model airplane. It was a long dream, but in most of it I seemed to be changing clothes. I would just get out of bed and change from sleepwear to normal clothes, or vice versa. I had a broken leg. Setting: At some old house that I've never seen, but that I thought of as Patrick's, and at a dim store. Characters: Patrick, my 15-year old cousin, lives in a small town in Missouri. He wrestles, plays in the marching band, and has a broken leg. His leg was broken in a wrestling match when the other guy didn't stop when the referee blew the whistle. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, neutral. I don't know why so much was unreal. I think ""middle of nowhere"" came from something I was reading. I was embarrassed about changing in front of my friend yesterday. I rode bikes with a friend yesterday. Also, yesterday I thought about driving for a while. It was a very long dream.",Negative

We're casual friends, and this is a friendly sort of little neighborhood garage. The burlier guy says it'll be $89.95 to do the work. I roll my eyes and say, fine, ok, at least it isn't any more than that, all the other work I've had done lately has been a lot more, this isn't so bad.

"I am with my sister, though not a waking life sister. She is tall, thin, and has long, black hair. We are riding in a convertible with someone else unknown driving. My sister is sitting on the front of the car facing the back with her legs hanging down into the inside of car. We are in my mother's home state, driving on I-74 towards CO where the landscape along both sides of the highway is just hills and trees. My sister has a gun. It appears to be a rapid-fire rifle. She is shooting into the hills as we drive. There was highway construction. The woman who has driving said something to my sister but my sister disagreed with her. Still, I thought they got along very well and seemed to compliment each other. The woman mentioned her therapist and my sister decided that maybe she should go see that therapist. We went to the apartment of the woman who was driving. Her and my sister entered the building before me. By the time I got in the building I didn't see either of them and wasn't sure where to go. I was standing facing a long hallway. There was an apartment to my left where the door was on a wall that angled away from me. The door was open and the inside was fully lit. I stepped to the door and realized that was not the correct apartment. About halfway down the hall was another apartment to my left with its door open and lights on inside. I went all the way inside that one until some man came out of another room and I realized I was in the wrong apartment. I rushed out. At the end of the hall was a third apartment to my left with the door partially open and some light coming out. I went in that one and was finally in her apartment. My sister and I were going to be spending the night so we were talking about where we would each sleep. She had a very long sofa, about ten feet in length, that was angled at each end. My sister suggested that she and I could sleep there, each at one end. The woman suggested that my sister could share her bed but my sister didn't me to have to sleep on the sofa when they both would be in a bed. I said I was fine with that and said that I knew while we were still in the car that the two of them would get together eventually. Two men and two of us women trying to sleep next to each other on a shell-shaped piece of furniture. A man laid down next to me and we immediately realized that all four of us wouldn't fit there. We still considered trying. I walk out of my bedroom at my birth home and there is a young man, tall, with black hair, standing at the stove with his back to me. He was standing there completely naked and removing groceries from brown paper bags. I stood there silent wondering who he was and why he was standing there naked. He must have heard me walk into the room because he turned completely around. I gasped and he said, what? I knew it was Mother's boyfriend, but I don't know how I knew that. I was furious. I rushed outside and got in her very expensive new car. I backed out into the road and then back into a grassy field on the same side of the road. I put the car in drive, got back onto the road, then hit the gas hard, and sped off. Mother comes to the woman's apartment when all of the neighbors are there. There are a number of people naked in a hot tub. Mother removes her clothes and gets in the hot tub. I can't believe she did that. The other people all think it's great that she is so uninhibited that she is willing to do that at her age. She couldn't keep her head above the water. I reached under her arms to try to hold her up but she would slide right out of my hands and back under water. One of the men in the hot tub moved towards her and held her up so she wouldn't keep going under. My brother Brian F showed up at 3 am wanting help picking up some kind of equipment. BJ was fine helping. When I went outside I saw that he had also gotten John S to come and help. More activity with apartment neighbors. One of the people there was the woman's ex-husband. They didn't get along well at all. Later I found out it was all an act, that they were working together, putting on this act, to get something they otherwise wouldn't be able to.",Negative

I was in a strange town. I had just heard about Chet Miller's being killed. Chet Miller had been killed two days previously in time trials at the Indianapolis Speedway. I was driving my car up a sidestreet in town looking for the remains of his car. I saw it but it was not badly damaged. Upon arriving at the hospital I entered the operating room.

She says something soothing like, ""Give it a chance."" I say, ""There is no chance. Howard is a sickie, an emotional sickie."" We pass a camping area. A man and a young girl are talking. I hear her say, ""I killed her. The other girl and I killed her."" I see small camp spots with steep boat ramps to the water. There is no place to stretch out and relax, just space to put the car and boat. I see a stream that's rusty colored and polluted. My father comes to a crossroad, a ""T."" He's going to turn left. The car is too far out into the intersection. 3 vehicles go by, very close, ready to hit us. I flinch as they go by. The 3rd one honks.",Negative
"I was watching a movie with Jason Bateman. Michael Cera was his son. There was a flashback and Michael Cera's character was being played by a fat kid using a phone at this building. Then these people, on woman and the rest men, shot a lady in the face, killed some cops etc. They went to this cop place and there was a lady in there and cops in a car outside. The cops outside managed to survive and tried to tell the lady inside to get out. The people came into her room and she jumped out the window. They killed her. Buster (Arrested Development) came in with stuff for his mother (the woman they just killed). He didn't notice anything wrong, which they noticed. For some reason, they gave him a bag of this brown stuff which was actually cocaine. Then it was real life and I had the cocaine. I tasted it and my tongue felt funny. My heart started beating faster and I felt funny. Later, Ezra woke me up to ask something about my web site. Dad asked me ""Have you tried the brown stuff?"" and I said no.",Negative
"Stephen Has Babies  I'm with my friends Stephen Ramos, Amy Leopard, and Virginia Hamms. We're getting into a car by the train bridge in Wilmerton. Stephen has babies. It is not clear to me if he physically gives birth, or if he is the father of babies. I sit in the back seat behind the driver. Amy is next to me. I'm leaning on her. She tells me not to lean on her shoulder, but to lean on her chest. We drive past the train bridge and I ask Amy if she has every jumped off. She says no, and I tell her that she should sometime and that it's a rush. She laughs. Amy and Virginia are being really nice to me. We drive to a park at the Main River. The water is really cold. Amy and Virginia eat a bratwurst with sauerkraut. They want some seasoning, and go get a packet of onion soup mix and pour it on. They share the bratwurst.",Positive
"I was at the airport. A Cessna, oh, I guess about a 310, landed and followed behind by a four prop C-6. It just so happened that I was bobbing around down on the runway where they just landed and they stopped. First, the DC-6, the big 4 prop, two stewardesses come out and then a couple passengers and then a half a dozen or so passengers come out of the Cessna, and I knew I was leaning against one of the airplanes. Some old biddy was saying to me, ""Sorry, but you can't lean against the airplane. You can't touch nothing out here. These planes are chartered to DCF or yeah,"" which stood for something, I don't know. DC Freedom, Headquarters of Freedom, something. So she's reminding I can't touch anything around here everywhere I go. Then I was leaving and I heard 3 old guys. One said to the other, one asked  one about the other about a test in a course. I forget now what one it was. This other one was a kid. He asked them if they had an _____________ and they were talking about that and it didn't seem to have anything to do with the airport. Then I was walking away and I walked in front of the Cessna and as I looked at it from the front, it looked like one of those real small Cessnas, and I thought to myself, ""They must have had a rough flight."" So there was an _________ and I was hoping that they did because of that one woman being such a pain in the neck. Then I was awoken, but I was still trying to remember what DCF stood for, and I still wouldn't know. I knew the F stood for freedom, but the D and the C I don't have any idea at all. The D I did, but the C I didn't. Anyway, I was trying to figure out to myself before I wakened.",Negative
"Bitter and angry about everything in Hillside. The Market was closing, and they wouldn't let me withdraw money. Ended dream by strangling Jimmy because he wouldn't park his damn van, just kept driving it back and forth. Laura ran up at the same moment and asked what I was doing -- just then I woke up and she was staring at me. Angry like I can't usually be -- at *everything*. Punching walls of the van. Then, after getting rid of Jimmy, we had a bum in our room. We were sitting there talking and he kind of transformed into Alan. He tells me (gold ring in his ear) It's better to be a free man than a bondsman. (Echoes of Thomas More!) I told him that all walks of life come with their own worries, troubles, bothers. He then changed into that guy from a local coffee shop, the grey-haired guy with the leather coat. He began to lecture me in that condescending way bums have when they think you don't understand just how demeaning and uncomfortable their lives are. ""Now listen John, Joseph, James Josh..."" He began every sentence directed at me with this formula. At one point I opened the door to force him out.",Negative
"I had a dream about Halloween. I dreamt that we had just been to the Cracker Barrel and that Mom and Dad bought three mechanical things. One was a black dinosaur that walked and shook its head, kind of like a Disney mechanical thing. Another was this laughing witch that was this doll thing. And other was a skull, a plastic skull that did things. And I dreamt that I was setting things up, and the kids from down the street were helping me. And before I knew it, they had four tables around me that like boxed me in, like a sound booth person would downtown. And I don't know, there was really no point to that one.",Positive

"(12/28/00)[""Mad at Howard's spirit.""] I am a spirit with many other spirits all hanging out waiting in some large attic room. I see a chimney space where some spirits are being lifted up to a lighter higher level. Howard's spirit is near me. I become very angry at his spirit. He'd some how tricked me so I won't go up to a higher lighter level yet because I didn't let go of my anger at him. An older man spirit is talking up at his wife's spirit. She'd already migrated to the higher place and the man wants to join her. He gets frustrated. His anger makes her start to move away and up. He begs her to stay. He couldn't bear it if she left him alone. She is gentle and stays, waiting for him.",Negative
"Was kind of out of the ordinary, but it wasn't too crazy. I dreamt that, first of all, I was trying to access the State University website over the internet, and it was apparently by taking some courses from State University because I was trying to figure out what some course material was and what kind of books I was going to need or something, or what the teacher was going to be doing the next thing, or something like that. And I was having a s_____ read different prompts and things, just, you know, like in zoom text except it wasn't really magnified all over the place. I had a real simple screen that I was working from, and the synthesizer was reading a lot of the stuff. And I had to adjust the rate so that it would read slower, and I couldn't, and then I sort of figured out how. And I think Mom was working with me on this one, and she was telling me that you could access the whole thing from a cell phone, and I didn't believe it. It was too whacked out. But then, the next little scene is the part that I remember the best. I was at this ba____ like place, it was like a trailer area but it sort of had more of a farm to it. There were vehicles and things around and there were cages of, most of the cages were empty, but there was this one cage that was sort of covered in the front that had big bars and they were wide apart. And they had geese in it, there were about seven or eight geese in a cage about the size of the chicken cage, and they were all jammed in there. And most of them were grown. But there was this one black goose that was real, real thin and light compared to the others, and I had a feeling that she wasn't really eating. She sort of quacked like a female duck, but she had a long neck and a big body like a goose. And she ducked her head and was able to scoot through the bars of the cage, and I put her down on the ground and she was following me up the road to this house. And she kind of got tired and I picked her up and carried her. And she just had a real sorry sound to her, and I had the feeling she hadn't been eating very well. And I told the lady who runs this place, I showed her this black goose and I said, ""I don't think she's been eating that well. Look at her. And the lady grabbed her from my arms and said to the bird, ""What do you think you're doing?"" basically yelling at the bird for getting out of the cage. And I said, I snatched her back and I said, ""That's not the point. What I'm trying to get you to understand, Lady, is that she hasn't been eating very well. You have to give her something."" And just about that time the bird left a big plop of poop running down my leg, and then I woke up.",Negative
"Man, where are the days going? Last night I had a really crazy dream that felt so real. The main point of it was that Suzy was going to perform at Disneyland, and she had three free tickets, and she was going to give one to her brother, one to Mom and one to me, if we could go. And it was like I knew that it was Thursday night, and according to my dream, we would be off down the Interstate by this morning. And ironically I saw in The Weekender that Celine Dion was going to be there at the park the same night. In fact, Suzy was going to open for her. And there was all kind of hoopla about there was this lady that was putting a house together that would fit the pampered diva and all that stuff, and then I realized that I really should call Suzy just to make sure the tickets really were free and we didn't have to pay anything because she heard something about, ""Well, if you guys can come up with $45, then you can go,"" or something like that. And so I was trying, it was like real late at night, and I called and I left her a message. And then I was kind of fading into consciousness and realizing that it was a dream. And last night I never did, I mean, the night before I never did get around to recording that one. I dreamt that, first, I was in the kitchen with Samantha, Sandra and Derek and a couple people from my chorus class, and we were all in these black robes and we were going to sing a song in the kitchen. And this teacher lady had a keyboard set up on the counter, and it was plugged into that outlet by the toaster, and she was going to accompany us. And next thing I knew, I was in this music class with this teacher, and the chorus was all singing, and for whatever reason, I had to work on this typing practice program. You know how they give you these typing exercise drill things? Well, I was working on a program like that on a computer that was set up on a rolling cart in the middle of the floor. This room was just huge. And apparently I was doing pretty good with the typing program because the teacher came over and said, ""Okay, I think you're ready for something else now."" And Mom was there, and did something else, I don't remember what. But the teacher was going to sort of put her class on hold and go and try to find a midi (?) program and see if she could make it work. And while she was gone, I noticed that in this sort of trashy box there were several unopened tapes and CD's. There were cards with song words on them, and there were ten tubes of wrapping paper that were just going to be thrown in the garbage. So I was like trying to pile that stuff in my book bag without the other kids seeing, and trying to save it from the garbage, because it was really good stuff. And then I woke up.",Positive
"I was in my home in New Castle, Pa, with my parents. There was a foreign army marching outside. Our house was being guarded by a soldier in front and a soldier in back. There was also an enemy soldier sitting in the front. Our family was huddling in the kitchen trying to think of a way to escape. We decided to sneak down to the cellar and go out an obscure door that was very seldom used. We went down the stairs quietly so that the soldier in the front room would not hear us. Our family got out the door safely and then we all ran in different directions. I ran and ran and ran and the next thing I knew I was awake.",Negative
"I went to my birth home for Halloween. There were a lot of us that were going Trick or Treating. I arrived in costume. Most of the others were in costume as well. Two of Uncle P's sons were there to go with us, but they weren't going to wear costumes. At the last minute I decided not to go. I and someone else, maybe Macy F, helped Brian F with his costume. It seems that it was some kind of a bug. It was shaped like an M & M, red, very soft and fluffy like a pillow, but it had four long thin cords sewn on at the left side of his body and after he put the costume on these cords had to be taken across the front of his body and attached on the right side. They weren't tight across the front at all. It was more like they formed a bit of an arch, yet there was nothing in them that should have allowed them to hold an arch shape. Also, they weren't supposed to be attached in the same order on the right side as on the left. So we were trying to figure out where each one got attached and keep them untangled etc. There was something like a button on the end of each one and that button went into a hole in the fabric that looked like someone had just cut or torn a tiny hole in the fabric. It wasn't an actual buttonhole. Just a few minutes after two people came back in to get something from one of the bedrooms. They were talking excitedly about how much candy they had gotten already. They each said they had over 100 pieces already. The front door was open and I heard someone just outside of it talking about something in the living room. As I went out there to see what was going on I noticed that one of them was just getting ready to throw something at a candle we had lit. It was like a votive candle in a clear glass candleholder, similar to mine on my altar. As he was getting ready to throw it someone with him said, Go ahead. Take your best shot. I wasn't in time to prevent what he threw from hitting the candle but I did catch it as it started to fall and prevented it from hitting the floor or starting a fire. As I caught it I looked at them. I don't know if they were children or adults. or even real people, though I assumed they were children in costume. The face of the one was very close to the floor and had a head similar to what you see depicted in movies as an alien. It was oversized, with no hair. As I looked at him he turned his head almost completely sideways, gave me a very odd look and then seemed to disappear. One of the people with him, the size of an adolescent, had turned and walked away as soon as I had come into sight. The third, also the size of an adolescent, just stood there looking at me. He was also in costume. It wasn't an alien costume but something intended to be frightening. I decided to go out with my family members who had returned to get something. I asked where the bags were but as I asked I saw them in a box. They were brown paper grocery sacks. That's what we were using for Trick-or-Treating.",Negative

There is a videotape that we have and I'm careful to keep it safe. Dad boosts me up onto the top of the rocks. Natives with spears soon surround me and take us captive.

A church member, who lives there, has closed the doors to the view. Father Andrew keeps saying, ""I remember you're telling me about this.""

It has bamboo sliding panels over the bookshelves. Then I find a wallet and I open it and it has many interesting and roomy pockets with zippers. The zippers are fairly easy to work and I am surprised at all the room in the little compartments. Then I wonder how I would fold it back up into a wallet when I fill all those compartments. I find a red small purse with another wallet in it and want it. It is $9.95, and even though this is a high price, I decide to get it as well as the other.",Negative
"I was in a concentration camp for children.  It was a horrible, awful place.  We (my brother and I and the other children) were sitting outside in the dirt.  It was a tiny space for as many of us as there were.  There was a Jewish boy who actually dared to talk to the authorities.  We just paced in the dirt, tracing the cyclone fence that confined us.  This wasn't just our outside realm to spend the day- it was also our only area to sleep and eat.  There was a separate enclosure with a single football.  There was another area with cages and 2-channel, staticky TVs.  There was no shelter from rain.  We were assigned tasks, even as mundane as the pacing.  A boy who was my brother and a little girl somehow made it through a small gap in a gate at an opportune time of retrieving the football.  I faltered in fear and didn't try to escape.  The two crept behind the 'officer's quarters' but nobody knew if they made it any further.  My brother was the only one I knew, and now I was alone.  There was a boy who he had talked to, though.  They had planned an escape attempt and I was supposed to go.  So the other boy and I used another's misfortune as a distraction as our opportunity to escape.  I think it was the Jewish boy who was caught for hiding a possession in the dirt.   He ran not 3 feet from the overseer to uncover a pickaxe.  The other boy and I made our way to the caged area.  There was an ugly exchange of using the pickaxe as a weapon against the fierce lady, barely slowing her down.  The walls of the cages and the TVs toppled on her.  We were free from the detention area, but we were fugitives.  I followed the instructions given by the leader of our escape.  We descended into a gutter.  We were not supposed to slide all the way down the green putrid stench of the gutter, but to cling five feet from the surface.  I thought we would surely be seen, however the boy in the lead seemed to know what to do, and the three guards who were following us continued on past the gutter.",Negative

"I am at some college function. The entertainment, two black men who are blind, comes. I happen to be sitting right where they sit down. I am pleased and say things like, ""My friend Lucy is blind."" The black man, with thick lips and dreadlocks, looks toward me scornfully and says, ""Who asked you?"" Then he starts picking on me. He asks me how come my lips look so funny, all pursed out when I say words. I start to explain it's a combination of entertainment and it's also sort of the way my lips just move. Then I say to him, ""Well, you should talk. Look at your lips, all thick."" We do this back and forth for a while. Now I am running on a track. There is a cluster of uniformed track women running ahead. I, the dreamer, watch them pass and I look way beyond them down the track and see me dead last. I have a limp and I am slow, but I am up and I am running. I feel good about that. Now I go to my dorm room, only I accidentally go to the 7th floor and have to walk back down some stairs. I find the name Vfabray and know that's my roommate's name. I go in and see belated Xmas presents for Charla have arrived. I open them, and notice my roommate has already opened some and put the tiger lily flowers up in a hanging plant thing. It looks pretty, but I wish she'd waited for Charla.

"Sometimes it was me and sometimes it wasn't, but I had this room which was like a fully contained flat and it was connected to this backyard which was fenced in. I was thinking that it would be a good location for a zombie film and have it all be based in that room/yard with the character not seeing anything beyond the fence. Then it was night and I was standing at my door and suddenly sirens sounded off and there were these red flashing lights and the fences were all closed off and extended higher. I was confused and then this kind of medical team came running in and ran up to me to test me and there had been a zombie outbreak. I ended up leaving and was somewhere else. The zombies were fast and when you were infected you changed within seconds. I was with some other people and this lady got bit and I looked around for a weapon and stabbed her in the heart, which was difficult. Everyone screamed at me not to but she had already started changing when I killed her. There were a couple of guys I was interested in and I was wondering if I should make a move. A young Stephen Merchant was there (looking like he did in Extras) and I really wanted to get with him. Topher (Dollhouse) was also there and he had a crush on me and everyone knew but I wasn't that interested in him, though I thought he was ok and would go for him at a last resort.

"I'm at a class and the man teacher is drawing things on the board. I am amazed that in just a swipe of the chalk, he can draw quite complex pictures with perspective.

I say, ""Oh, so that's how you do it."" He shushes me; he doesn't want the others to know. Then I put a pink baby bonnet I made on his head, as a joke, and giggle at how silly he looks. Then it's graduation time and I receive some plants and some cats as gifts, a black cat and an orange one. The plant looks like a bird of paradise plant. It needs to be transplanted to do well. Now a fat woman named Velma (from high school) says she's getting married right now. She wears a pretty pink night gown and I go get the baby bonnet made and give it too her to wear as her veil.

"I have arrived in Paris again, apparently by boat, and am in the Gare St. Lazare or something similar where Le Havre trains arrive. I decide to pick up suitcase later and walk to a nearby stamp store to see what they have. It is a store that I have visited before. Exiting from station I note time is 8:45 a.m., but that the weather is foul, dark and murky and uninviting. I think it odd that it should resemble more closely 5:00 a.m. weather. Return to station and get case and then walk to where I have a car waiting, parked opposite station. Astonished to see my car full of people, sort of dark working class types. I place case in with them and find a spot to sit crammed in rear. A cop taps at window and I lower to see what he wants. Asks how come car parked there and I say it was only for a minute while I got my case and that I had brought the car over with me. He seems astonished that I would bring a car with me. (Car is a small blue Renault.) The guy at wheel drives away and when he turns right instead of left, I realize we will not pass the stamp store. I shout to stop and ""get out of my car!"" They continue and ignore me. A few feet later we slow down because many people and some cops are crowded on street. I open window and shout ""Stop!"" and bang my hand on side of car. Car stops as a few police walk over. (Prior to this as we drove away from station I looked around at all other parked cars, thinking I may have actually gotten into wrong car, but I see no other that resembles mine.) I am so annoyed as the cops approach, I cannot think to speak French and keep shouting ""STOP!"" Next we are all in police station and asked to produce registrations. I do and a cop puts into an open, used envelope and does same for the workers' registration and then walks away into another room. The workers, four or five men, a woman and a small child, sit down and wait patiently. I walk up and down, annoyed at all the waste of time, and keep looking at them. They don't seem to bear any malice toward me and I think this odd. A long time passes and the cops don't take any action, and I am worried that maybe I did take the wrong car.

"I was working in a gas station where I worked 2 summers ago and a car pulled in. It was about a 1950 or 1952 Chevrolet wit a couple in it, husband and wife. People I've never seen before, about 35 years old. The car was burning up because the radiator didn't have water in it, so I remember I -- as is the case in gas stations, you open the hood and you very carefully loosen the radiator cap and elt the steam begin to escape. While I was doing this, the boss, for example, came over. He was talking to the couple. He asked what kidn of car is the best, if they wanted to buy a new one. I remember the wife and husband were kind of, well, it was something to the effect that the wife wanted to get a new car so she was kind of hinting to my boss and said that the new cars were very good and so forth and that they should buy one. Anyway, I remember the boss said that he wasn't too sure about these new cars because with the new range of mechanics that were coming out, they could fix up a Ford very well. They could fix up any other kind of car very well. Then he wasn't too sure which was the best. As I said, while this was going on, I had finally gotten the radiator cap off and the car was steaming quite a bit. I kept putting water in the radiator. I told them to let the engine idle as you should. Then very naturally as you're supposed to do in this dream, I also brought the hose inside the car and was watering off the dashboard.  This was supposed to help bring the temperature down and that was about the end of the dream.",Negative

"I was at a shop looking for posters of The Beatles and Monty Python, etc. I couldn't find any. Ezra and Emery were there too. I did find some Beatles bags but they were lame. Mom was also there. Ezra said that Dad had put all the Pokemon clothes together. He had a cool one. Only one of the rest sort of fit, but it was too tight and was green with a Pikachu on it. We were then at a house. Nana was there. She asked if I wanted something and I said that I didn't know what it was and she took out ice-cream tubs (like in the shops). There was pink and blue stuff and then white as well. She reached her hand into it and handed me some of the blue (it was light blue). I took some off with my finger and ate it and it was nice. Then there was green, which was nicer. She gave me an icypole thing but it was attached to seven others and they had to be eaten in order and the green one was third. Nana said to not eat more than one. I went to Ezra and Emery and they took the first two. A young James Spader was in a room. Dad and I were outside and had to climb up this big vertical net thing. When we got to the top we didn't know how to get over. I went through a hole and then Dad did. I don't know what happened then. Dad had a site and the address had INXS [something] and then a slash. I couldn't remember it and Dad was annoyed. My site had a background of space and stars and I had dreams on it. They were in a firey colour and it was hard to read. Dad complained about it.

"I was on the road to Clinton. I had to go to the health department there and pick out some paper work. I was not afraid of a drug test.

She was wearing an elegant black cape with a beautiful curved deep neckline. From the edges of the shoulders and trimmed in beautiful soft fur like a fur boa almost. I wanted to take her picture. I had one shot left in the camera. I had a present for Veronica. A little yellow chair with an Eiffel tower in it. She liked it.

"I was flying in a military airplane, some sort of small bomber. The pilot was not recognized. We were flying in heavy clouds. It was rough flying. The pilot was going to try and break through the clouds underneath, but instead started going up. He broke through the clouds and I saw a large bomber and two helicopters (army type). This was weird because helicopters don't fly that high. Oh, a voice told him not to go down because there were enemy ships below. The next thing we were flying towards a corner like in a room, and this guy (a James Bond type character) asked us to let him off there. He asked me if he could stand on my knee to get a boost. The next thing he asked for the pilot's gun. He gave it to him. Next we were on a couch. I reached under a cushion and found a German Lueger and gave it to the pilot who now looked like a German.

It was dark and warm all around me, even though I think I knew it should have been cold and snowy. Kit was sitting next to me, his arm around me, and his five o'clock shadow rubbing against my cheek as he nuzzled me. I felt my entire body tensing, gathering energy, pulsing and warm. I squeezed his knee with my right hand; I have a distinct memory of digging my nails into his thigh to release the pressure. The tension was building and I just waited for everything to snap. The dark began to dissolve around a tiny yellow light that brightened in front of me. The light grew and shrank, grew and shrank, grew and shrank until it overwhelmed the darkness, and I was twisting and squirming and grabbing his leg and having an orgasm.

They had a utility van that they used as a family car. All of the children were in the back. There was a wide age span. Some of them were close to Matthew's age. Some of them were very young.

The border was small slats of something like a maple wood, varnished, that he was lying on top of each other and around. The look resembled that of butcher block. That one went in a little bit and then he did it again. So we went up to the actual level of the floor of the patio. He had poured old cement next to the old.

Some of them were kind of walking along there, kind of on some of the lumber on the side of this pile of dirt. The lumber started to fall.

I told her to take it by the street curb and take out the lumps and then to mix the paint well because I would use it. I saw Bull in the paper in the entries.",Negative

"I was at school and I had asked this girl to the prom, but I didn't want to. I was afraid she would say no. She was really pretty, but wasn't a girl from this school.  She said yes, but then she died in a car accident the night of the prom.",Negative
"I received a call from Freda L asking me if I wanted to go to Florida and join her and Susan J and Dorothea D there. She said something about Thursday, I asked which Thursday. She said, this Thursday. I said, Thursday of this week? Because it was already Monday or Tuesday, and I couldn't believe she would be asking me to do this with such short notice. She confirmed that she meant this Thursday. She went on to explain that the three of them were on a train on their way to Florida, and they thought it might be fun if I could join them for a long weekend - Thursday through Sunday. I hesitated, debating in my mind whether I wanted to do this for several reasons. The first reason was that I wondered why they hadn't invited me to wherever they were coming from on the train. The second reason was that it was such short notice. The third reason was finances. I didn't know that I really wanted to tell them that I wasn't working right now or that I was having financial problems. After all, if I had been successful these past years finances shouldn't be a problem, right? I could tell she was a bit put off by my hesitancy. I'm on the train with them, Uncle J and Aunt A are there as well, which I found very odd. It seems that wherever they had been they had all been there together. They were all sharing a suite on this train. I was surprised by how spacious this area was. In one part of the suite there was a table with bench seating kind of like a booth you would see in a restaurant. Uncle J and Aunt A came in and sat down at that table. There were also a lot of small children running around. I don't know if they were Susan J and Dorothea D's children or grandchildren. I think they were grandchildren. As we were talking they told me that they were only paying nine dollars a night for this train suite. I thought that would've been affordable for me. As we continue to talk, they told me about a conference they had attended, and that this is where they were returning from. It still doesn't make sense to me that this particular group of people had attended a conference together. So my feelings are still hurt about this.",Negative

"I dreamed that I was at some summer school and Hermione was there. There was a sign that meant someone was dead. So Hermione had a blanket wrapped around her heat, so I guess we thought she was dead. Then Tyle was IM-ing me in class, but I couldn't see him anywhere. The whale, Free Willy, was there, and I had to play Text Twist to pass my final exam. I got the word ""through."" Then I saw Spike doing his laundry.",Positive
"There was a lady. She was very nice but she didn't hardly have any money. She had lots of apartments and rooms though, in the city and she helped people who had a difficult time putting things back on shelves. The rooms were bigger than usual. Big enough to put a table in the room. But because the lady did not have money, she had no plates. She had some leftover spaghetti and she dumped it in a pile on top of a newspaper for everybody to eat off of. There was one fork to share and she stuck it in the pile of spaghetti like a flag claiming Antarctica. She said she had to make sure if the lady left her i.d. card out on the table that she put it in the slot. We were in the waiting room. Cheap plastic and aluminum chairs attached to the walls so nobody would steal them. My mother and my father were arguing viciously and me and Dora and Rudy were sitting acting like we weren't there--not saying anything. My mother said, ""I send you to take care of the deed to some property next door and you sell it to Charles Manson."" And my father said, ""Jerry, I went and told the fella I had some property I needed him to help me take off my hands and he said OK and this is what happened."" She was screaming and crying and saying, ""I try and I try;"" with that horrible crying that makes you so nervous that you forget everything else in the whole world. my father whispered without raising his voice, ""If you don't hush up, I'm going to take you to that therapist.

Some people I know, but I can't say for sure who they are. I ended up accidentally blowing something up. I felt guilty when I woke up.",Negative

"Point of No Return  I'm at a casino dealing Blackjack. My high school classmate Lyle Zeffman and another man are at the table I am dealing to. Lyle has five red five-dollar chips bet. He doubles down. I have a ten showing. I line up his chip stacks. The second stack of chips is one short. I add one and make the stacks even. I flip over my down card, which is like a film case that you put a used roll of film into to get developed. The card has 10 dots on the other side: I have 20. Lyle loses the hand, and $50. He throws chips on the floor. I pick them up. I think about stealing his chips. There are other dealers there.  There is one small person and two big people being held captive. They're trying to get out of the basement of the casino. The phone lines are cut. Europe explodes. I see three people riding on a cloud of smoke from the explosion. They are high above the earth, like in outer space. I'm at a place, which may be home. My mom is there. Miami Sound Machine comes on the radio. The place I'm in seems like Europe.

"Some crazy guy came over looking for Mom. Her car was here, but she wasn't. I told him this and he threatened me with a knife and I told him again. Then he drove off and Mom came back. Mom and I went to the shop, a deli, and they had Blade costumes. There was Blade and some fat lady one. Mom got Blade for me, size 69, which was really small, though it was a large/medium. Anyway, it was too small and I wanted to go back but she didn't. Then I was at school wearing it and then I scared some evil spider off. Jayson was writing something about his birthday and I said I forgot to do that this year and he thought I was just copying him so I got on the computer, but could only find prev [can't read, starts with a p, and is possibly 'previous']. This happened at a cemetery? The crazy dude came back. Someone had a baby. Johnny Knoxville was there, but he was some ""Apple"" guy. Then the father of the baby got killed. Johnny put his clothes on and sat in his truck. It had a big playground area for an animal on the back. I saw him and he motioned for me not to tell anyone so I didn't.

"There was a big concert. The band was other worldly but sometimes was Bowie. At lesser times it was the Rolling Stones and rarely Pink Floyd. I danced. Danced like crazy to ""Hang on to Yourself."" I had 2 pony tails on the sides of my head like handlebars. They were bouncing. I was dancing between rooms. The walls were thick, thick marble. Big and open. Between 3 rooms were 3 big wide open doorways. You could stand in the doorways until it was OK for you to go into the next room. I was in the middle room. Doorway to the front room. It was smaller, but still big and airy--thick marble. There were chairs in rows. Empty chairs. I was dancing. There was an old iron fold out tray with blue paint and sharp sculpture tools inside. Stephen had been acting crazy and I needed to keep the sharp objects away from him. My father had got an elephant. He also got a new young colt because Scooter died. He was living in a trailer and had a story telling class there. 4 people were there. Me, my father, a girl and a boy. Girl--about 20 and Spanish. Guy--about 25. black. He read his story and kept going faster and faster. He was saying things a pro football player said, talking tough and arrogant, then finished with words to Rappers Delight.......hip, hop, hibbidibihoppi and hip hip hoppin, etc. My father and the girl said it was real good, but I said, ""I couldn't hear you. I couldn't understand you. What you say matters to me more than what a pro football player says and words to a song. I was feeling brave to give my opinion after being in Eileen's class, but his feelings were hurt. I went in the kitchen and there was a mouse-person scampering on the floor. I thought, ""Oh no, someone's been sleeping with the hamster."" And there was a big ear with dog feet. I said, ""What's wrong with that dog? He's deformed."" And my father said, ""He feels bad because he's black. He looks how he feels."" I thought that was rude of my father to say in front of the black guy, but really it was deep and empathetic. my father had a cheap internet print-out of tricks to train your horse. But I thought my father was better off following his own feelings than a so-called expert stranger. I walked down the stairs and through a crowded restaurant. I had been laying out in the sun and lost my top and I as looking for my flip flops. I walked with my arms folded across my chest and hoped nobody would notice. A natural disaster happened in the sea near Switzerland or Sweden. Due to the energy in the air--lightning--the energy of the waves. To avert mass destruction a group of people had climbed up on each other's shoulders and let the lightning electricity strike them, flow through them and into the water. One woman died--because she didn't believe she was strong enough to make it. She didn't believe. Her husband carried her across the beach by the legs--stiff as a mannequin. She had on lavender sweat pants. Then I had to go to the hospital--Beth Israel--to see somebody I didn't know who. I walked up 7 flights of stairs and didn't find them. One the way out I found Dora in a group of people and she said wait for her while she went into the Duane Reade. She came out with 3 giant candy bars and I wondered why. When we went out the metal detector she gave on to Ricky Shell who was the bully. I told her I'd go get one to replace it. He had taken her favorite. But she was giving them all away anyway. I was suppose to be going to Dr. Stastny. I kept walking with Dora and I didn't know where he was.",Negative

He rolls over so he's over me, but not on top of me, and we talk for a while. I fall asleep and then wake up.

But then I was stopped by Mr. Kunz after my Spanish exam was over, and had to sit down in his class. And he gave the exam which I had never been in his class one day this year. And in his class his exam was very weird. It was like philosophical, and he had these things where, these questions where you, in order of the alphabet you sing the scale and it corresponds to certain letters and you're supposed to sing the pattern, sing the letters, and then recognize the pattern and then sing some other letters and see which ones make the pattern.

So I was trying to figure out the best way to do that. I kept cutting and pasting the text into different cells of the Excel sheet to find the best placement. There seemed to be a vertical bar of color along the left side of the text. Sometimes when I placed the text that vertical bar of color seemed to change or disappear completely. I debated whether that was okay or not. I think I ended up not using it in other ways at all.",Negative
"A very small plane came straight down through the trees of Lang Lawn. It was spring and a lot of girls were watching it come down. Finally it came down with no damage resulting. Barbara Ayres, a sophomore here, climbed out. Everyone was quite surprised to see that it was she. Babs left the plane on the lawn and went into the dorm. Joe Warner, a senior, appeared and claimed that the plane was his. Nobody seemed to question why Babs was flying it. The plane was the smallest one I've ever seen. There were two seats, one behind the other, and an average individual could just fit into it. Lee Ellsworth, another senior, told the onlookers that it took 9.4 seconds to get off the ground if Joe did it. Suddenly I was in the driver's seat and Joe asked me if I knew where the throttle was. It was under a rubber mat on the floor. The instrument panel had very little on it. But I got it started in 9.0 seconds. I went off the ground and Lee was yelling at Joe that I beat his take-off time. Then I landed.",Negative

His son was there too. I think I left came back. There were a lot of women there. It seems that they were all nuns, women from CIIS, and BJ. One or two of my CRHP sisters were there as I was going in. I had asked this one woman help me to learn how to use the Stairmaster. She wasn't sure how to use it but showed me. She fed this yarn into the Stairmaster because it would do some kind of knitting as you were using it. So she fed this in and it was feeding out this long piece of knitted yarn. It was very irregular and uneven and it came out very fast. I said well, it's very uneven and irregular. It doesn't really matter because it isn't something I want or need anyway. I was still having trouble using the machine. Then I was looking for someone else to teach me how to use it right. There were two machines there.

So all the freshmen and sophomores went on this trip and Sue and I were left behind. So when the trip returned everyone sought to create everyone's worst nightmare. All these people were chasing me and trying to shoot me, which I guess is my worst nightmare. I ran into my house, which was like the Order of the Phoenix in Harry Potter. Mr. Bailey was there with a palette of nail polish, trying to communicate some code to me. But I couldn't figure it out. So then I escaped to a kind of vineyard where Sue's worst fear was being realized. Her worst fear was that everyone had found out some secret about her.

Nearby another white object was a number of newspapers fastened on the limbs of a small tree in such a way as to form a wall and a partial roof.

And this fire alarm box in the back of the room had these like wires attached to it, and what you were supposed to do was attach the wires to some kind of big appliance, and if the big appliance gets too hot, it'll go off. So everybody in the class gets this form to fill out about what they've done in the school year, and so I've ______, and so we're all sitting there writing our papers and the room is so quiet, and this boy in the back of the room is sitting there fiddling with these wires. And Melinda and me are both telling him to stop, but he won't. And then the class starts getting all more commotiony. And then for some reason the teacher switched off the lights and put them overhead, and was teaching us how to write 8's so that they looked good -- you know, how they used to teach us how to write letters in kindergarten? Well, this teacher was so upset with the way we'd been writing 8's. She wanted to teach us how to write them right. And then the class cleared out and Mrs. Dougherty came by and said, ""If you wait here fifteen minutes, I want to come back and practice with you."" Well, I was waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for it felt like two or three hours, and I went to this little room that had a bathroom.

"A deaf female teacher/star is being sued by her husband over the lyrics of her song. The school board makes a ruling. She and the husband drive to the school to get the decision. A hired man (agent or something) is driving the car. There is a circle cul-de-sac and on the curb is the board, who are playing a tape of the song. This somehow is an embarrassment to the woman singer and she's pissed. So as they drive around the circle, she says to the driver, ""Do it,"" meaning speed up the car, drive it up over the curb and over the lawn and through a sculpture; destructive. The driver pleads with her not to order him to do this. He says, ""Please. I'm asking. I'm begging you. I'm demanding. I'm refusing."" She stiffly and angrily orders him to do it. Against his own wishes, he then starts to obey her. Some woman (perhaps me) in the back seat reaches over and grabs the wheel and they fight as the woman tries to force them to not hit the sculpture. They crash and someone, the driver or the woman, is now walking alongside the singer, screaming at her angrily! ""Damn it!

"This dream must have taken me into the future for I found the present church much altered and I recognized very few of the people there. The interior was very dim and sombre, partly because rich memorial windows had displaced the familiar ones. The pews were ranged in semi-circles leaving a large space vacant before the chancel. I asked someone if this was for T. H.'s chorus. ""No,"" was the reply, ""They sing in a picture."" Probably this was a poetical way of saying that they had passed into history. The pulpit, I think, was gone. The greatest change was in the organ. The original part was still discoverable, but it had been extended across the entire front of the church. There were ranks of silver gray pipes rising before the chancel windows. Some were so long that they rested on the floor and disappeared through the roof. Smaller ones flanked the minister's room. At three places there were keyboards and benches. Mr. Y. was in his old position playing a stormy composition. When great power was demanded, he jerked a clothesline which swung open a large door in the case of the organ, and the tones pealed out with overpowering effect.

He was with another lady, not very young, and with a stern expression. He made a gesture like asking me what had happened, what I had done till now. I felt ashamed, but didn't let it show. I just looked at him and turned around. The priest who was saying Mass stopped it and said that the next part would continue later on and he invited us to go somewhere, I don't remember where, but suddenly I was in a house where they had a birthday party for a relative of my priest friend. I saw myself surrounded by girlfriends, and we were making jokes. I saw a friend whom I hadn't seen in a long time. She is tall and thin, has green eyes and long hair. We were talking, and I think we ate something, I don't remember what it was. Note: The priest friend of mine is 28 years old, he is a professor, but he never taught me. He gave me the chance to transfer to the university where he teaches, and I got in, but later on I got out and never discussed this with him, because I didn't see him. The friend I describe was one of the best friends I had in school.",Negative
"I am in an apartment. There is a baby girl sleeping in another room. I am standing in a dining room with Charla. I look out the window and see a huge black tornado funnel. It looks like it could come our way. I tell Charla. I then see there is another one on the left. I say it might hit us here. Charla and I watch as it approaches. Get under the table I say as it is obvious it will hit us. I worry about the baby girl but think she's safe so far away from the window. The tornado hits and I hear breaking glass. Fortunately the dining table protects us from getting hit by flying glass. After it is over, we get up and walk outside. I am picking small shards of glass out of my hand and arm on my left side. I'd picked them up as I moved through the broken glass on the floor to get up. They hurt but it is not serious damage.",Negative
"I dreamed that we were at our school dance, and this man with a gun came in and put a gun to my friend's head - and then he shot her and I went to call her parents and they got there.

"I am driving the wrong way, against traffic. I see four lanes of busy traffic coming at me and dodge the cars crossing the lanes to get to the right side of the road. Then I am angry at Ellie because she has decided to move out of my house and I don't think she's ready yet. I tell her that she should wait until she's got her full head up out of the ""waves,"" not just her eyes, meaning she takes too much risk and needs to slow down and take care of herself.",Negative

Seamus was saying something about me and Dmitri hanging out more.",Positive
"It felt as though I woke up, sat up in my bed, saw three tables sitting to my left, gave some thought to the things that were sitting on them, and then laid down and went back to sleep. This happened more than once. [I don't have three tables sitting to the left of my bed in waking life. I don't know if I woke up to any degree and can't say with any certainty if I sat up in bed or not.] Later, someone came in and talked to me. I was in a room on a cruise ship setting up displays for fifteen SAID stores. I had three, square tables sitting in a row along the wall. Each had just a few things sitting on them. Each table was a different store. I needed to determine the best layout in this room to set up the fifteen tables.",Positive
"Next, I'm in a public place - maybe a restaurant - and I'm near a window-counter thing where either you order, or you pay. I'm in line (the rest of my group - LT people again - are still elsewhere - at a table?) with some women I'm acquainted with, they're lawyers, all well-groomed, nice looking, nice suits. They know me from the library, or at least a couple of them do, and one is saying, ""She's really good, she really knows her stuff"" to the others, who nod and look interested. I feel as if they are older than me, mostly because of their professional status and income and grooming, but I know that we're more or less the same ages, I'm just aware that I'm not on that level with them - I wonder how they see me. Something is mentioned about a job they've been trying to fill - one of them even holds up a piece of paper with an example of what they need done, and I can see it's just putting things in order and shelving books. I think they don't know what my regular job is in the Business Office, they just know me as being in the library, and they don't know what else I can do or whether this would be paying enough. I say to particularly one of them, well, it's certainly something I could do, but there are other things we ought to talk about - I wouldn't say no...without seeing what else there might be going on with it and what I could do for you - how about if I come see you and we'll talk? So we fix that up, and just then Lori shows up next to me (there seems to be a kind of cafeteria line to my right), she's just arrived. I haven't seen her in a week or a few, maybe, but my word she looks awful! She's lost a lot of weight, her face looks drawn and pinched, and she's cut her hair short, which is certainly no help. I'm very concerned and ask her what on earth's happened. [There is no reply before I wake up.]",Negative
"Too Cold To Swim  I'm with a group of people and we're going to play softball or swim. There is a conflict over which we should do. A kid on my dorm floor in the group is eating.

"I watched Dr Strangelove with Ezra and some others. The end was similar, but different to what I remembered and they found it funny and I said I didn't anymore and brought it down a rating. They had accidentally started the countdown but had stopped it, and then the guy was on the bomb. Ezra and I were outside on the grass and I said I'd been outside heaps lately because of reading at Nana's. Uncle Wilbur and Mom were there. She made a joke about him being single and in his 40s and said that I'd be copying him/beating him and I said 'that's what I wanted'. Queer as Folk had different endings. There was one that people said was ""like 2004 style Queer as Folk"" and Stuart had an orgy with 3 guys. This black American woman moved in with 2 gay guys who owned a business that allowed people to move in with gay people. The room for them was soundproof. She said 'I spend most of my time caring for this child' and was very posh. She said 'as long as the latest you go to bed is 2am, it should be fine'. Brian showed up there.",Positive

I was upstairs and went down to my room. No one was there, so I looked elsewhere, then returned and there were Mrs. C. and Mrs. Ed. In cleaning my room, the maid had pulled down my garment bags and tossed them in a pile on my bed. My dresses would be mussed. The bell rang and I started to lead my guest to the dining room. I told Mrs. Ed. I had not invited her and she went away. In the dining room, others had started to eat. No place was set for four and Miss Mc had pushed into the center of the vacant space. I got chairs for us and she moved over. Then I went to the drawer and got silver. We sat down and I introduced Mrs. C. and Mrs. Chal. but the others kept telling their names before I could.",Positive
"Cute Acne Girl Says Goodbye  I'm sitting outside of the south side of Major Hall at Brimson with my friend Stephen Ramos and another older man. A tour or prospective freshmen comes along.

"In Vietnam, as a witness, I view war at close range. The first thing I see in the crowded street is an AK-47, stuck into a wall by its bayonet. There are angry words written on its stock, but I cannot remember them. All around, Vietnamese men are frantically fighting, shooting back over a wall or barrier. I am lying on the top of a bunk bed, sorting through the belongings of someone. This person, apparently dead, had collected stamps. Paging through a small album, I see many American air mail stamps I recall from my youth. Suddenly a man nearby is shot and falls. I see the bullets kick and sting the dirt near him. Two nurses, wearing red and white striped dresses, come to his aid. They are completely vulnerable, turning their backs to the enemy. I am amazed at their bravery or foolishness. One nurse in particular attends to the man, who is mortally wounded. Recollection ends here.",Negative

"I started watching a TV program of shorts called ""Stories Told by You"".  The white text of the title appeared on screen.  The stories were supposed to be about people's experiences with the 9-11 attack.  The first story was of a young black child, maybe 4 years old, sitting at a table with a parent trying to teach him.  I was that parent, and I think we were working on conservation tasks, trying to prepare him for school.  He poured some water.  I was proud of him.  The person we talked to though, said he wasn't up to level and couldn't get into school.  We argued with him.  The boy had had a head injury- hit with a rock, I think, which had set him back.  He was re-learning, and we insisted he could manage.  Then the boy was grown, 18 I guess, sitting in a classroom wearing a loose gold top.  He was either ready for graduation or it might have been his birthday.  The teacher had on some gold pants that matched the shirt he was wearing.  A younger, maybe 12 year-old black girl was sitting at the front of the class.  The teacher was giving clues about some inspirational person and she was supposed to guess who it was.  In this case, I think it was the boy.  When the girl found this out, she countered it, saying he wasn't really all that great.  The boy was upset and spoke up for himself, saying, ""well how do you think I feel...""  He was retarded.  He had borrowed a textbook from a white boy in the class, and the white boy angrily took the book back when the retarded boy had unintentionally begun drooling on it.  The second story was of a woman.  For a while I was her, and was in a Curves Gym class.  This consisted of sitting on something and moving it- it was like a large spring-mounted horse as seen at old playgrounds.  The woman was with some friends, and her boyfriend ended up stealing something out of her car.",Negative

"I'm in China in semi-desert place with American travelers. We seem to be a trade or academic delegation. Suddenly about 500 Chinese walk towards us. I'm uncertain, but not very afraid. Then smiles on those in front rows. One comes forward who knows a little English--a man about my age wearing a little blue-denim Chinese worker's cap. I say slowly that I'm a railroad worker, but lost my job when the volcano exploded. They are feeling sorry for me and express regrets--a ripple of ooos and sighs through the crowd when he translates. Then I name slowly the cities that I may go to in order to find another railroad job. I wonder if they see similarities in American union protection and Chinese socialist protection. Suddenly, I'm in a pasture behind where I lived when I went to college (close to the university, but still we kept two cows). The Chinese are with me. I decide to show them my house and garden so they will see an American place. We walk slowly around the house and I talk about the oak trees they have never seen and the flowers that are new to them.

"I went into a store that sold fabric and carpet. I don't know if they sold anything else. I was looking specifically for some blue denim. I have no idea why. The displays, or where they had the fabrics stocked, were all very tall, taller than 6 feet. They were cube shaped with each side of the cube was open where the fabric would slide into it. Where the carpet was displayed, each side of the cube just had little squares of the carpet samples. They seemed to be on the kind of rack that stores use to display posters, where it's kind of like turning pages in a hanging book. When I was walking around this store I saw Dick W. He was a decorator. I think, when I saw him, I was____. Now I'm not sure. I noticed him and was thinking something about the fact that he was in there shopping. He was talking to an employee about the project he was working on, getting ideas, or explaining what he was looking for, not sure. There was also something about DDSI. There was a very tall metal cart. Taller than me. Yet it's other dimensions were that of a typical metal cart on wheels, rectangular shaped. It was outside on pavement on a slope. I pushed it down the slope. I can't remember if I rode down the slope on the cart of if I just pushed it down the slope and just let it go on it's own.

"Dream begins when I am home in C--. My mother and I are sitting in the living room. I ask her questions about how and when one of my brothers was killed. I ask her how old I was when the accident happened and she says I was five. I answer by saying then he was twelve and that I should be able to remember what happened. Mother starts to cry, becomes hysterical, and keeps repeating that she could have saved his life if she had taken him to the hospital just one hour sooner. She appears to go completely insane. My father, 53 yrs., comes into the picture and tries to help her but can do nothing.--All at once my mouth is filled with blood and my front teeth begin to fall out--dream ends. Interpretation Actually I was two years old when one of my brothers was killed by a truck. He was seven at the time. I remember nothing about him, but have often wondered what the facts were concerning the accident. I have never questioned my parents about it, because I realize it would only bring back very unpleasant memories. About two days before I had this dream, the maid here in the dorm told me that once she took an overdose of sleeping tablets, and that if they had waited another hour before taking her to a hospital she would have died. This probably accounts for the part I dreamed where mother said she could have saved my brother's life if she had taken him to a hospital one hour sooner.

"The first dream was a horror movie that we were a part of, at first.  A house, with a 4-intersection hall.  There were quite a few of us.  Any direction held death.  A few of us went to the right; we had managed to get up towards the roof, towards freedom and escape.  I went back down to find some of the others.  Across the hall was a wall of fire.  There was such destruction everywhere, it was hard to look at.  I managed to find one or two and led them back.  We had trouble climbing back up to the roof.  Some people came looking for us.

"I was in a ball park taking batting practice.  Whoever was pitching to me was throwing mostly high and inside pitches, and I was fouling most of them off the handle of the bat.

Once I swung hard and trickled a foul off to the left, off the handle of the bat, and noticed that the bat, a brown one, was broken.  I had a hard time choosing another one which felt as good in my hands.  I started to use one, but it was a fungo bat.  Another was too short.  Another one was pretty heavy.

"We went to Classmate-M-09's house and his room was this shared room full of bunk beds. Tristan was there too and had said Daniel was actually a girl, and I was trying to see if he was until I realised it was just because there were teddy bears and 'girly' things around but we later found out they weren't his. The house from the outside was made of stone and was very rounded and fancy looking. He said his parents used it for their 'clients' (they worked in film) so they didn't have to book hotels. I was walking down the street later, wearing my sunglasses, when this girl said 'hey, Izzy' and I stopped and vaguely recognised her but didn't know who she was. I said as such and looked at her name badge but it didn't ring any bells. She said she went to 'Bush College' and I remembered I had gone there for a month or so in highschool. She was talking about some stuff I'd said and was acting like we were best friends. We were somewhere else later, outside, and people had made some short films and were getting awards. One was for best film made by a 'homeless' person and this guy we had seen staying at Daniel's got the award. I went to the canteen later and it was this round booth that was quite large (looked like those kind of bars in the movies at a beach resort) and I got a ham crossaint. I went to find somewhere to sit and didn't want to sit with Tristan for some reason and saw Emmanuel sitting with some other people at the 'bar' of the canteen, but didn't want to look weird or have to sit with other people.

And I guess he looked pretty mean because Dad was standing there and saying, ""Now what kind of impression do you think this is going to give people? People are going to think that you have an attraction to violence, and you may be a suspect of something, and you may be arrested, and you may lose everything in a moment.""

"I was at home. Eugene, Darius, Alejandro and Jeremiah were staying over. Ezra was there too. My room was really messy. My diary was on the floor. I was going through a box of stuff and Alejandro was watching me. I found some Goosebumps books and I said ""I love Goosebumps!"". I didn't want them in my room in case they got hold of my diaries, but they didn't go in there. I was going to play Pokemon Diamond.",Positive
"I'm round at Jude's house. He is in his late 30s now, but has new parents - perhaps he's recently been adopted? His new parents are rich and foreign - perhaps Russian or Eastern European. I'm upstairs in his room. He's agitated, excited. His new mother comes up with a present for him. She's very proud of him, and has a sickly expression on her face, as if she spoils him. Stuart looks pleased with the gift but doesn't waste time; he's straight into the box. It's a new electric guitar - and it looks exactly like mine. He hands it to me and asks me to play a new song he's written. He wants me to mimic certain chords, but I can't quite get them right. I realize afterwards he's trying to get me to play the exact same chords in a song by Teenage Fanclub.",Positive
"I was watching Kenny vs Spenny [I watched it last night]. Spenny was chatting to some school girl with big boobs. He invited her to something and then I realised that she was only 13. Then he was drunk somewhere and had facial hair and was singing and then said ""Heil!"" at the end (like that little bit at the end of The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill) and I was trying remember what song it was from and I was thinking that it was Wishing (If I Had A Photograph Of You). I had to get Spenny approved by some insurance thing so that he could go into some shops. One was a kid's shop. Then Kenny and I were in a shop. I hadn't told him about Spenny and he had asked me not to. They had some lollies like those bracelets things. The 13 year old from before had a geometry test, but wanted to go out instead. I went to the park with Mom and Rover. There was a magazine with a diet plan where you could lose 2 kg in two weeks. Running was part of the exercise. I decided to use the mowed part of the oval to run on but Mom complained so I decided to stick to the abnormal route.",Negative
"There is an old car which is parked just behind another car and which I am supposed to move in front of that car.  The car has a large clutch on the roomy floor and a smaller brake a little farther to the left.  Just above the windshield is the emergency brake.  I don't know how to start the car, but when I turn a little knob or something, also above the windshield, I find myself hurtling toward the car in front of me.  I swing quickly to the left to miss it and still stay barely on the pavement, then have to fumble around and quickly step on the brake to keep from plowing into the canal or something at the end of the street.",Positive
"Our family arrives at church, and I discover that I only have on a dirty pair of trousers and a sleeveless white t-shirt.  I wonder why Mother and Daddy didn't notice it before we left home.  I can't go to Sunday School and church like that.  Mother says I'll just have to go home and change.  I start out in the car, but notice that my good blue trousers, my suit coat, and my white short-sleeved dress shirt are in the car.  So I decide to find a closer place to change.  I go to Longhorse St. and am going down it in the direction of our house when I see a streetcar on the tracks with nobody in it.  It has doors like a train coach on each end, and is almost covered in ivy.  I consider it as a place to change, but think someone might come along, and the ends are kind of open.  I think on the way home I will go through City Park and possibly find a place there.  Then it occurs to me that possibly I will see Linda Forestt there, since she is supposed to be camping at 10:00, and church started at 9:45, which reminds me that I am already late.  I go through the entrance to City Park and see a bunch of girls swimming in a pool.  I am surprised-the weather isn't exactly cold, but it isn't warm either.  I go on to Aunt Wilma's house to change clothes.  I don't have a tie, so decide just to wear the slacks and white shirt.  When I get there, all the girls (Girl Scouts) are there. I think Linda is there too, but I'm not sure.  I realize that church is more than half over and when I get back it will be over completely.",Positive
"I am tired. I just did two days of speaking at a conference. I am Oprah Winfrey. I go to the hotel room, which is quite expensive. My husband and I are supposed to leave this hotel and go to a cheaper one, but I am so tired that we decide to stay another night here. All I want is to swim in the pool and watch a little TV and sleep. My husband is very supportive. I go to the window and call out encouragement for the women's volleyball team. I am now a helper of Oprah and do an interview for her so she can rest. Now it's time to leave and I'm late and missed the bus, so there's a car load of Boy Scouts who have room for one more. It's a tight squeeze to get my wheelchair folded up in the back, and then I squeeze into the back seat with the boys. I notice that the driver is also in the back seat, with steering wheel and buttons there. I look in the front where there is also a steering wheel and lights and buttons that the boys are pretend driving with. It isn't functional though. We go and arrive at a house, possibly my parents'. I come in. The driver hands me a pie. I start to eat it - whipped cream and so on. My mother notices the meat chunks in the pie (like turkey or chicken hearts or gizzards) are not done yet, nearly raw. I remember the driver had not cooked it for very long, so she goes to cook it a bit more. My father is disappointed and leaves. Now I see a fan going to a room where Elvis is. He wants Elvis to autograph his orange. Elvis is rude, selfish, spoiled and arrogant. He pokes the pen into the orange and growls a few sarcastic words at the fan (male). I go in next and ask him to autograph my orange. Elvis would like to have an affair with me but I spurn him with some contempt. I tell him what I think of him.",Negative
"(12/04/00)[""Dream program presentation.""] I am at an ASD conference. It's the middle of the night. I'd been working hard on my dream program and the research on my dreams. A man, friendly and attracted to me, is very interested in the findings of my work. I tell Charla my granddaughter she needs to go to bed now. I shut down the computer even though the man is still very interested in my dream program work. I need to leave to give my presentation. I am now at the conference. I walk up a few steps to the stage area and to the podium. I look down at the audience noticing the high backed pews they are sitting in. They seem to be a it far away. I begin my talk. I am aware of a pile of papers on the podium. A bit messy. I wonder where I should start. I begin to describe how we can search a root word and get all the syntaxed versions of the word.. I proudly announce I have a 15,000 word dictionary, melted down from my... I mean Barbara Sanders... many dreams over 25 years. I see audience members smiling at my slip of the tongue I make the same slip often. I'm not fooling anyone. I begin to talk about the category system, how it started with the Hall/van De Castle system. About this time, I realize I'm getting enthusiastic about describing how my dream program works and how I created this and this. I shift the topic to the research results, which is the main topic of the presentation. I announce I am very excited about the results of my research. I studied my...Barb Sanders nightmares. I found a very high pattern of the feeling ""resistance.""` and not fear or disgust as I had expected. Then I found a high level of a ""sense of peace"" This really interests the audience. I say, let me show you the results on the transparency. I look to my right and realize the assistant did not have the overhead projector set up. I rush over and try to find the transparencies and do it myself. I see piles of them and leaf through them but don't find mine. I am aware I could lose the audience with this distraction and go back to the podium and continue with my presentation without the transparencies saying perhaps the assistant is merely late and will yet show up. He never shows up and I continue the presentation.",Positive
"There's a girl in my bed. I hear a voice (I suppose, telepathically) telling me something like she's always been more comfortable in ""the other world"" (i.e., dream world) or the dream world is better for her. I pick her up to bring her downstairs, but I decide instead to put her back in bed and cover her completely. An evil spirit tries to ""convert her"" or something and her mother is converted too. This is the part I don't understand in the least I don't remember what they were converted to, although I know it wasn't something good.",Positive
"Breaking Windows of a Chinese Restaurant  I am by the Chinese Restaurant where the McDonalds used to be in Oak Valley. I'm behind the restaurant with another person, near the driveway of the light green house with the dogs that I used to deliver papers to. I have a rope with a big rock tied to the end. I am throwing the rock at windows that are high up on the restaurant. I break some windows, but can't get the rock up to the big window I want to. The string gets wrapped around the middle pane in a window. I pull it and it unwraps. We've been there a while, and I'm worried we might get caught. A man, his wife, and their daughter come around the building. They are the owners. I run, going through the back yard of the house with the dogs. I'm about to go over the fence, but the little girl catches me and I stay. I could run, since the girl is only about 3 years old, but I don't. The wife comes and throws a fit of anger, screaming and jumping up and down. I think she is going to kick me. I could beat her and run, but I stay. I yell at her, asking how much she wants me to pay for the windows. I think I have enough. I ask her, ""How many Yen?"" She doesn't answer. Her husband comes. I try to get out of trouble by paying them for the damage. I don't think it works.",Negative
"The Miniature Saber Tooth Bear  I'm sitting on a bench, between Burger King and Daytons, with my backpack, in the Uptown Mall in Oak Valley. The bench faces west, towards a store where a woman is working. The store is small, and the woman neatly dressed, and selling small, expensive items. I seem to be wearing gloves. I get a basketball out of my backpack. I sit on the edge of the bench, bouncing the ball. It gets away from me and rolls towards the small store. I get up and follow it, but not hurriedly. It rolls into the store, and I go pick it up, apologizing briefly to the woman. She is really mad, and gives me a deathly look. She says she's going to call security, and then does so. I go and sit down on the bench. I'm worried about what security will do when they arrive. I see the security guard that I know from high school. He struts over to the store in his characteristic way. After a brief interaction there he walks past me. He trips over my legs, which are outstretched. He sits down next to me on the bench. I think he's going to say something about the basketball rolling into the store, but instead he tells me he caught a two-pound bass! I ask if he caught it through the ice. He says yes! He says he and another man also caught a six-pound walleye and a small bear! He says he also shot a small bear. I cut my index finger on an object that one usually wouldn't get cut on: it seems to be a relatively flat sheet-like structure, like a piece of cardboard. The cut is about _ inch long, and very fine, like a paper cut. I put a band-aid on it, and instead of wrapping it around the tip of my finger, I apply it lengthwise, over the tip of my finger. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is there. She meets a fat man. I hear her talking to him. She has doubts about our relationship, and I hear her talk negatively to him about me. The band-aid doesn't stick to my finger. I have a small black bear in my hands as I sit on the bench. It's about three inches high. It has a white stripe down its back and large fangs like a saber tooth tiger. People playfully put their finger in its mouth, poking its large teeth. I'm wary of this, even though it seems to be such a cute little playful animal. The bear is getting sleepy in my hand: it is drugged.",Negative
"Grey's Anatomy was on TV. Mom said it looked like a good show and I said I hadn't started the new season yet because George had died and he was the only character I liked. Later, Ezra was looking at The Soprano's stuff. There was a picture of Silvio and I said that I liked Silvio. He also typed in some nonsense and we joked it would come up with stuff about Paulie, but it came up with Silvio. I asked who his favourite character was. We were going to the movies and usually I was in the front. Ryan and Ezra were also in the car. I went naked and got dressed in the car for some reason (and I was in the seat behind the passenger). I decided I didn't want to go because it had actually happened before and had to led to some lame events and I turned back time and I had to do everything the same but I didn't want to have to watch all the movies I'd watched again.",Positive
"We were at some theme park like Disneyland or Six Flags, but I couldn't figure out which. And for some reason we were with Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce. And Dad was showing me this ride that was like a race car and he said that if it was going to go on a roller coaster, it had to have three seat belts for the same passenger, one that goes on top of another. And they had to wrap around the front seat and go in the back seat so that they could be for two passengers. And all of this looked really scary, and I noticed that this car had something in it that most race cars don't have, which is in the audio system. And then we were looking around at some other different rides and seeing how wild they were, and we figured, ""Hey, let's go on this conveyor belt through this place."" And it was like a building with a couple of different things in it. And we went, we jumped on the conveyor belt and we saw this monster just running across it. I started running too and I couldn't figure out why we were running. And then we were at this show watching the Little Mermaid swim around this fish aquarium tank. It was supposed to be like she was singing a song, but we all know she wasn't singing in the water.",Negative

"I was at the video shop in Parkville, but it was different and organized differently. The foreign movies were separate from genres. I was in an English aisle and found Yojimbo and Oldboy there. I grabbed them and then remembered that I'd seen them and put them back. I was looking for Paris, Texas. I found a section which had all season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and said ""I wonder if there's a Joss- [Whedon section]"" and then saw there was. There were two other girls and they wanted 'Keeping Julian' and there was an exchange which I can't read, but has something to do with Firefly, and then we stared at something in amazement and discussed how awesome Joss Whedon was. Then a guy called out to one of the girls and they asked his name and he said ""Big Tuna and I laughed, as well as the others. Ezra and Dad were then there and I was thinking that I should explain about Jim and Andy's tuna joke from The Office. I got my phone out to record them and they were just saying jokes from the show. Then Will Arnett and Amy Poehler were there and got up to talk. There were two guys and they did a competition and the one that lost said the other guy cheated, but went along with it anyway.",Positive
"I was recording with some random camera. We were outside and on these stadium type seats. Daryl was next to me making weird noises. Melodie was there. Evelyn was doing a bunny hop and something about a mouse trap. I was trying to remember who I liked because I didn't like Dmitri anymore. I was at a shop and was burning a CD. The camera had a weird memory stick and was taking forever to copy over. I got in trouble, but I said that Mr Carmichael always lets me do this so I figured that it would be alright.",Positive
I woke up and went on Facebook to see a million posts about Kit Harington having died. He had been in a 'fatal car accident'. The headline on an article was 'Kit Harington dies a brother' -- his last word was apparently 'brother'.

"I am in a room, probably at school. Eva and Doris are there. I have some school books (and, I think, a CD case). I try to pick up the books but they keep falling. I need to get to Mrs. Wright's class, but I can't carry all of my books. I think I try to put them in my locker (although I can't remember that scene). Then, I go to Mrs. Wright's class, to tell her I'm sorry for being late and I need to get my books in my locker. I'm outside the door, ready to go in, when I see a kitten in the door, waving at me. I now realize I should just get my books and go to Mrs. Wright's class when I've gotten my books. I remember a dream, possibly from a third person perspective, where I'm a young man looking for success. I know this isn't me. He doesn't have my personality and I don't even think he looked like me. I really don't remember much here, except that he was a strange person, funny in a way. I expect people to give me money if I do something or other. I've got a couple pieces of paper that could have been something like tax forms or a stock market portfolio, but I don't remember. A teacher comes up to ""me"" (or ""him,"" interchangeable pronouns) and wants me to help her with something in the classroom.

"Truckin  I'm driving a semi-truck. I'm driving a group of young adults, my age, on a fairly long trip. I pull the truck into a gas station in a small town. I'm not really sure where to park, so I just stop next to another truck. People go into the shop to get a break from the driving. The truck starts to slide sideways. I'm outside the cab on the ground. I try to control the slide. It bumps and smashes into the semi-truck next to it, and then bounces back, sliding into the gas pumps on the other side of the truck. I realize I haven't set the parking brake on the truck. I put the parking brake on. The truck then stops sliding. It then slides a bit more. I look at the front tires and see that they're over some hatch-like vents that have popped up, or are up, off of the ground. The truck slides down these hatches about 12 inches. When the truck wheels hit the ground at the bottom of the hatches, I think it is finally stable: it won't slide. The others come out from the store. I don't think anyone has seen the fiasco. I'm especially thinking if the owners of the gas station have seen it, since the truck hit their gas pumps. My housemate Stephen Ramos is among the people there. I have been driving the whole time. Stephen says he would take a turn. I say no, I'll keep driving. I am sore and stiff, but we haven't been driving that long: four to eight hours. I keep driving.",Negative

"I was at a shop with Ezra and he was reversing the car. I was living at the old house and home and Dad's new house. I was at the old house and there was a water tower thing out the back. For Ezra's birthday they had done some experiments? There was an electrical short which affected the tower and brought it down. It would take months/years to fix. I was then at home and I asked Darren how we were supposed to survive summer without an aircon and I said ""I can barely survive summer with an aircon"". There were lots of bits of paper outside. Mom said I had to walk the rest of the way down a hill or the paper would get shredded. I didn't understand but did it anyway. The paper slowly shifted and I took a photo. I asked if this was a dream and she said yes. I went to Dad's and looked for food and movies. I couldn't find anything. He was talking later and said my diary would be affected.

It had double garage doors, on the left side of the L. You had to pull across the front of the house to pull into the garage. Very odd. I was inside the new part of the house with Brian F, I think. It was framed. I think they were starting to work on the kitchen. I was talking about when they were going to move in. It seems that the new house was on the same property as the current house so they were going to move in one room at a time. As one room was finished they were going to move in to it. So they were moving into the kitchen first. They were using some of the kitchen cabinets from the current house in the new house. Brian F was talking about being excited about moving in. I made the comment that I had no intention of moving in this new house. He was put off by this and didn't understand. I'm not sure why I was so adamant about not moving in this new house.",Positive

We, the woman and I, pick her up as she fights us, and take her to the emergency room. She insists she's fine and hasn't taken drugs. Again we go to the emergency room. We follow the nurse down the hall to a five-bed ward. We choose a bed for her to rest in. I look the room over and decide we chose the right bed after all. The other one by the door is also right by where they put the empty garbage cans and a noisy garbage truck works near there. The doctor comes over and does a test and says she has traces of board and other elements that indicate she has taken drugs. Board is a material that is in some drug as a filler. So now we can take her home. I sit her up in a chair ready to carry her home and I say to her, ""You better listen girl, the third times the charm.

Later I enter a house and two Scottish girls that I apparently know well are sitting in the kitchen at a table with their mother. They appear to be visiting and this is my house. A fourth woman is also in the kitchen and apparently she is my mother. They are all laughing. I ask if they are telling unclean stories.

Then look down at it and note I don't have it on, but instead am wearing an orange turtle neck and no tie.",Positive
I saw a redecorating TV program quite a few months ago where the man was upset when he came home and saw what they did. This dream was like a follow up to that. It seemed that I changed back and forth in the dream between being myself and being his wife - who had invited the decorator in to do the work while her husband was away. When I was myself in the dream I was trying to get the man to not be angry with his wife. The dream became very sexual in nature.,Negative

"In this dream I remember that I was at home. I was planning to go to the beach. A couple of my buddies were going to come by and we were going to go over to the beach. They came by and I imagine we went over there, but I don't remember going over there. I remember coming back and it was at night. We were riding along on a causeway coming back. This sports car went flying by us and it looked like there were 6 or 7 guys in a sports car. I remember as they were going across, they were holding up some sort of flag. It looked like a white flag on a pole as they were trying to cross. I remember that we had something similar, only we had a blue flag. We decided to hold that up too, and we were both just going across the highway like that. I remember over on the other side for some reason they stopped and we stopped, and we got out and we were talking to them. And I remember for some reason I found out most of them were from Barry College except for around 2 of them who went to the University of Miami. After that I don't recall, but, any more about how I arrived there or anything. Then I remember driving down the highway toward the University, U.S. 1 and there was a party, and we pulled in and went to the party. All these other kids were there. It was a large party. I remember this one sports car came pulling in. It was red. I don't know what the make was, but there were 2 guys in it and a girl with real long brown hair. They pulled in, they just kind of looked around and then they pulled out again. That's all I remember.",Negative
"I was at a hospital. Simon and River (Firefly) were there. There was a black girl in a coma, there was a spike on the machine which was caused by a strong feeling - in this case, love. We realised it was because of her brother and we told her ""don't touch your brother or your father"". Simon was in another room and made up this thing for River to drink and it was twice the normal dose. He gave it to me and I went to find River. Then I was with this girl who could teleport. We went to a hotel lobby. I asked this lady if Boyd was staying there and someone said ""what about Lynn?"" and someone had a message. I told them that they were about to go out because the bad guys were coming. We saw them and teleported away. Then there were cops (or FBI) in an alley but they were dodgy. Then I was on an excursion somewhere far away. People started getting weird after a few days. The guy in charge said he didn't know the way to get back. A guy kept trying to attack me. I called Mom and asked her to pick us up -- there were 511 people. She asked how much it was going to cost. It had also cost $80 for the excursion. She said she would do it and I was thinking that I'd just take my friends and leave the rest of the people here.",Negative

Some lady had sex with it. I stayed with the people sometimes and I went back. I got sick of them and pretended to leave. Later I got my things. This older brother and I went out to see this dog. There were dogs in cages and one cage was open and there was a feral dog. It got out. There was this little shed place. I went to hide but the dog got in and took up all the space (it had like mesh on the outside). I managed to get out, but it kept following me. I managed to run to the road and it got hit by a car. Someone said something about my smell. Later, there was another one. It sniffed me. Then Valerie and Farrah were there and they had orange juice. One of them said ""Anyone want any orange juice?"" and I said ""Ew, it's orange"" and that I only drink water. Then I was in the games room and this dog jumped through the window. I quickly ran to my bedroom and shut the door. The lock wasn't working. I went to my laptop to find out how to get rid of a raged dog. There were two pages of information and something about Johnny Depp. Then I was in a desert. The kittens were revealed to be two Arabic men. They had a gun.

I had to make it quieter to actually figure out how to make it work. And it looked a lot like the calculator I used to use in middle school. And that was kind of all there was to it.

I align the markers correctly while he watches. I am working on a Friday, 4-10pm. Jack and I walk into the store eating bananas. He motions for me to hide my banana, because we shouldn't be eating in the store. Another manager, Darma Mantle, is there. She walks by me as I am up near the front of the store getting hot chocolate and marshmallows. She asks me what I'm working. I tell her 4-10pm. Another employee, Sandra Cauly, who looks and sounds like the woman on the movie White Men Can't Jump, is on the intercom paging the courtesy employees out to the cart room to get rid of some weed.

"I was in an institution - perhaps a prison or a prison camp. The prison incorporates several buildings and some fenced off land. The buildings were old. The interior decor seemed decades old, with formica fitted furniture, brown and split. In the dormitories there were bunk beds, acrylic curtains and cheap carpet tiles. There was a damp smell. I was living with a group of non-violent captives. We lived in unity - we seemed to get along. There was a communal area like a living room or common room with old sofas, a fire place, cheap ornaments and trinkets on the mantel piece. Across the yard (which was a muddy field) was another building that contained the more violent prisoners. It was a much more sturdy building made of brick and iron, and was surrounded by a security fence. Suddenly the door to our common room opened, and three men walked in, not in any rush. They had faces like psychopaths. The largest bearded one calmly started helping himself to things on the mantel piece and shelves around the room in front of perhaps 15 of us. He made confrontational eye contact with myself and anyone else who dared to look at him. His two sidekicks stood back and smirked at our inaction. None of us dared to confront them. They eventually turned and left, slamming the door, smirking. It reminded me of Clockwork Orange (the film). This incident broke the unity of our collective. We were all angry with one another that no one did anything to stop those thugs. The rest of the dream is fragmented: The thugs apparently came from the other building. We launched a retaliation which involved walking over there on mass ready for a confrontation. I think we were humiliated a second time - we were surrounded by murderers and psychopaths who wanted to have an excuse to kill us with their bare hands. There was also a scene back in our dorms with arguments breaking out about ownership of the top bunks, which were perceived as being more secure places to sleep compared to the lower bunks. I don't recall there being any guards or order other than a vague understanding about our fate, which was to stay in this place. Perhaps to try to leave would be severely punished by captors unseen.",Negative

I see an alien store and enter it to get the right food for the baby. She (now Jennifer H) gets hysterical and screams and cries. I yell at her, ""Shut up!"" She shuts up and is angry at me. A pause develops and I feel embarrassed and try to explain how we need to work with the aliens to help the baby.

I hid in the corner with a knife. He came in ages later and looked in every cubicle and then saw me in the corner. Then it went all black. This happened again and I was with someone, a girl I think. I hid. Someone said someone was coming. There was a small window in the toilet. I heard someone say ""Basil"" who was a big blonde dude. I decided to run.

"I had gone to a meeting at SMW, I believe it was. I think there was a board meeting going on, though I don't think I was actually on the board. I had been asked to serve on the board. They were meeting outside. The meeting area was on two different levels. One level was shaped like a rectangle and the higher level was shaped like a circle. Members of the board were sitting along the long end of the rectangle and along the corresponding sides of the circle. I was there doing something for the school. It involved. It involved something that was in this circular area where the board was meeting. I had to go up to that area several times, kind of going in and out as they were meeting. I don't know if the meeting was actually in session or not, or perhaps it was just a very casual meeting. Several times, as I went in and out of the area, various people said things to me. One time it was a woman. Another time it was a man who was not quite 6 feet tall, with a medium build. There was another man who spoke to me a couple of times, who reminds me very much of Dan M. They were both warm and friendly towards me, but the one who reminds me of Dan M was probably a little more so. The last time I went into this area, this man asked me something about where I was going or how I was getting there are all made some comment about that. As I was motioning, I said while to walk back to your then back out there and then down there. It seems to me that there was a main road entering the campus and than a, not really a side road, but a side path that led to this area where they were having the meeting. That's what I was referring to when I answered him. He suggested that I let him drive me rather than me walking the entire distance. I don't think I even hesitated before saying, OK. Earlier, the other man had said something the other woman about wanting to go out with me. Then they both chuckled. I don't remember now exactly what he said, but it gave me the impression that he really only wanted to go out to be intimate. Since he gave me that impression, I really had no desire to go out with him. So I didn't do or say anything to encourage him to ask me out. I don't know how I knew this but I knew that the other man was gay. Maybe that's why I didn't even hesitate to let him drive me. With him being gay, I didn't have to worry about him wanting to be intimate with me. After her that he and I became pretty close and did a lot of things together. One time, we were doing something. He was sitting at a table, and I was standing behind him. I leaned over and my arms around him, and kind of rested my head on his shoulder, as we were talking and laughing. I was thinking about how great it felt to be so comfortable with someone, and to get along so well. I was back at the school with all the same people. The other man said something to that other woman about me not going out with him. The woman said something to me, it almost sounded like she was scolding me, or accusing me of being rude for not going out with him. They both wanted to know why I wouldn't go out with him. I told them it was because of the comment he made that led me to believe that he wanted physical intimacy on a date. That may not have been the only reason why he wanted to go out. His comment did lead me to believe that he certainly did want that. Spending time with this other man was very safe.",Positive

And what kind of a red flag go up with FBI agents. One of the things that Dad said that he would find commonly in the department is that when somebody sends an SOX message, the police and the FBI would think they would mix it up with some other kind of message that would mean that they're getting ready to have a plot to blow something up or something. You know that an SOX message really is the start of exclusive ______. When somebody's sending SISEX messages, but apparently it had the certain number of zeros and ones that just matched up to something bad in this dream.

It was just all silver and it had little LEDs on it that would come on when a certain channel was active. So I sat this silver mixer on one TV tray and I set up the keyboard on two more TV trays, and I think I had some kind of other, I think I set up the CD player on the floor and ran wires to it all. And I don't remember why I did that. I don't know how I was going to amplify it in the bathroom either, but I think Mom just wanted to see how it was set up. And then we were upstairs on the little landing area hallway, and that old CC TV was still over there, and I had this big over-sized storybook about The Night Before Christmas, I guess, and I was reading it there and Mom was reading it out loud, like as I moved the tray across and I chose a word, she would read them out loud.

Suddenly a loose 2x4 near the 3rd story of the old edifice was blown loose by the wind. It came down and conked me on the head. I lay on the ground paralyzed, i.e., able to see, feel and hear but unable to move. People gathered around and finally an ambulance came and took me away.",Negative

"I am a traveller carrying one light bag and looking for a place to spend the night. I do not have a lot of money and someone suggests a place. We walk there to discover a hostel of a sort in a large indoor space big enough to house a gymnasium. I find a spot near a corner and prepare for bed. I think to myself, ""Luckily I have my high-tech pillow."" I take out of my bag a light, flat panel about 8 by 10 inches and the thickness of a thick piece of cardboard. ""It works by applying a voltage."", I say. ""There's a new kind of material which fluffs up when you apply a voltage."" On the face of the panel is a liquid-crystal display with two ""buttons"", one labelled ""on"" and one labelled ""off"". I touch the ""on"" button with my index finger and the flat panel magically inflates to the dimensions of a fluffy pillow. I lay it down on the ground and comfortably go to sleep.",Negative
"I went to school and I was in my old English classroom. Ms Eckert was teaching us and Evelyn was there. I realized that it was impossible to have English, as it was Monday, so I said ""Screw this, this is a dream"" and proved it by doing a reality check. I was going to kiss Eugene as I was leaving, but I didn't. I then lost lucidity and Mom picked me and Ezra up. I went to the toilet and there were no toilet rolls. I had to get lunch for school, but we forgot. Mom went to this phone place. Santiago was there. I decided not to go back to school because it was 2pm.

"I was at university and Eugene and Autumn were doing the MUPC. I wondered why Eugene was there. The teacher was saying that those who did well were offered an earlier exam. I said to Michael (on accident) that it was lame and he said it was probably like it was going to be on the ""14th instead of the 18th"". We were doing some math revision and I didn't remember any of it. There was an episode of Supernatural. This lady was in a house in the lounge room and her son was watching TV on the floor. Behind her the lounge moved. She looked and nothing happened but then it moved again and she asked her kid if the lounge had just moved and he said ""apparently so"". The TV moved too and she ran. It was night. She ran to a crime scene and asked Autumn (Supernatural) for a lawyer. I can't read the next bit but there's something to do with a Sakata chip.",Positive

"I was part of an extremely dysfunctional family. There were two daughters. One was about 11-12 and the other 7-8 years of age. They were extremely belligerent to their mother, and disrespectful and don't do anything they are asked, etc. They're dressed absolutely awful. I finally told them that they are going to get cleaned up and changed. I gave the first one an hour in the bathroom and the next one an hour. And I tell them that they will come out looking and the way their mother and I would like them to look. Initially they were very sassy and sarcastic in interpreting what that meant. Once they got started they yelled out into the kitchen a question and their mom started to respond real sassy. I said, No. Stop. Answer them in a different way. So then she was very nice about how she answered. When they came out they looked very nice and respectable. They had done a really good job. A bunch of us were in the kitchen preparing dinner. BJ was there. I think this must have been BJ's house. She had two stoves. They were each on separate yet adjoining walls. So it was hard to use. I was sitting on the floor with the youngest girl. They opened both ovens at once. I grabbed her and held her very still to make sure she wouldn't get burnt by both of those doors opening at once on either side of her. I told her how dangerous that was. They said something about my kitchen. I said, Well, I just have one stove. I do my baking in it. Then they were fixing steak and baked potatoes for dinner. But we were eating everything except the steak first because the steak wasn't done yet and they had just fixed a couple of baked potatoes. They were cutting them up and giving each person just a little bit of each one. That was fine with me because the potatoes were way too big for me to eat a whole one myself. A little bit after that they were still in the kitchen and I was sitting in another room with the husband. The mom and someone else was canning green beans. I called the little girl to come out there with us because I didn't want her to get burnt. Those canning jars and the steam from the canners can get so hot. I was concerned that she would get scalded. We heard a timer go off so we knew that some of the jars were done. The mother brought a couple of them in to show us. It had not worked. The jars had not sealed and the beans and something else that she was canning looked very odd. Everybody was upset because it didn't work. All this produce was going to go to waste. Then we went to a swimming pool. I don't think this was the same family. We saw another family come. They had two male adults that were about 4 feet 11 inches in height. They both had a number of severe mental and physical disabilities. The one, I said, Oh no. That's the one that has that really, loud, obnoxious laugh. I was thinking about leaving. Then as they were getting ready to go in the pool I noticed that the other one, one of them was getting ready to tell him he couldn't get into the pool and he was pointing out that he had on some kind of swimming diaper that was going to make it okay. He had this thing wrapped around his head, including his face. It looked kind of like plastic but when they pulled it off his face was so completely disfigured. It was almost as though you couldn't see eyes, a nose, or a mouth. I was trying very hard not to look. They took the plastic off and then put the plastic back on and conformed it to his face to make it look more as though he had a normal face. They just laid the plastic back on. They asked me to help and I felt very uncomfortable and I didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable because I didn't know what I was doing and such. I said something to that effect. He just took my hand and shook it and said thank you, as if to say that was nice of you too, to just acknowledge that.",Negative
"I'm walking in a mall and there's a store that sells silver and I think I'll duck in and look at silver flatware but at first I don't see any and it all seems to be big stuff so I go out and around again. The store is sort of self-contained and has 2 or 3 entrances, so I can go around it and look in the windows and all. I get to the other side and see the room with the flatware is over here. Besides, there's a man following me (or he sure looks like it) and I want to get someplace else, somewhere with people. I go in, see some stuff and see that this outer room is only samples and the main collection's in the next room - they probably have everything.

"My dream was set in what appeared to be another planet. The coloring was all brown, except for a few neon lights. This place was not familiar to me in real life, but it seemed to be in my dream. My best friend was in the dream - and she was in search of her meaning in life. She was 16 in my dream, as she is now, and her father encouraged her to find this meaning. The only way she could find her purpose was if her father died. He was aware of this but she was not. He tried numerous times to kill himself in subtle ways - but was never successful. Then he realized the only way to die was if the ""mother bird"" killed him. This bird was the queen of this place I think. So my friend was told by her dad that he only had 30 minutes left. The minutes were counted on a bomb-like digital clock. When 30 minutes were up, a giant white bird with neon pink streaks appeared and pointed at him and he exploded like a firework.",Positive

The enemy sneak up and light small fires in the corners of the tent. The fires smolder. The general doesn't notice. A woman and a man come to the tent and see the fires. They want to warn the general so he can escape with his life. But instead, the woman, in an attempt to help the General, pour gasoline on the fires to get them to flame up big.

"Mark Long is Alive  My friend Mark Long, who committed suicide several months ago, is alive. I am sitting with him in his living room. We are talking. His older brother or brother-in-law comes in and sits down in a chair. He is angry with Mark for faking death. He and I exchange words. I ask him to leave, and he does. Mark was in Chicago for a long time. He did fake his death. Outside the deck doors are little children with dark skin, a rabbit or two, and a dog that are dancing to some sort of beat. Their ankles are shackled together. Mark's father and mother are there. She is nursing a little boy. His sister comes in and says to me, ""Thanks for telling us (that Mark is alive).""

"I was in an elementary classroom as a teacher's aid, and it must have been a Christian school because we were talking about what sounded like it was the ""Acts of the Apostles,"" but they were calling it ""The Journey of the Early Christians"" or something odd like that. And they were talking about different stuff. And these kids were supposed to make posters about something like that, or going to a country and being a missionary. And I was supposed to make one, like as a model, to show them how they're supposed to do it, and it had this border, it had this square within a square, like a frame almost, drawn on the posterboard. And I had colored it orange and I was taking a big fat marker and I was trying to draw around the frame and make it like a 3D look, you know how you put a black on a side and then at the bottom to make it look like there's a shadow? Well, I was doing that on the bottom and the left to make it look like the light was coming from the right, and as it turned out, instead of a line, it turned out to be this big blob, and this really, really, really heavy line that was like running off the page, and it did that at the bottom too. And I was thinking, ""This is just so terrible. I feel like I really messed it up."" And Mom was there, and she was like, ""Oh no, you didn't; oh no, you didn't. You to finish this up. You have to keep drawing this. You have to keep doing this."" And I said, ""No, I'm not going to keep doing this."" She said, ""You have to finish this up; you have to keep doing this and you have to use this one."" And I said, ""No, it's the worst thing I've ever drawn in my life.""

"I was having a really neat dream last night, one of the best organized, I think, that I've had in a while. Usually when I have dreams about birthday parties and Christmases and opening presents, everything is real vague and kind of distant. That's kind of one of the reasons immediately I know that it's a dream because it is so vague and distant. But this time I had a dream that I was having an early birthday party with Samantha and Sandra and Derek, so that we could celebrate with them before we went to Jackson, we could celebrate up there, then we could celebrate when we get back on the actual day. And for some reason Samantha, Sandra and Derek have been showing up in my dreams a lot lately. And we were in the living room and I was opening some presents. The first, I got some books for my birthday, meaning in my dream, and I can't remember exactly what they all were, but one of them was, it looked and smelled like the copy of A Tale of Two Cities that we got from the library, but it was some other French title by some person. And it was supposed to be one of the most profound things in literature, but I was like, I don't think so. Then I got this other book from Dad that was like a small, about the average size of a paperback, but a little thinner, and it was supposed to be this quarterly journal like type thing about sound and stuff. And it was kind of brown and old looking, and it had yellow print on the cover that said, ""How to Take Amplifier Wattage and Apply It to Speaker Power,"" I think is what it said, something like that. And I'm thinking, ""Okay, do they have to have such a thick volume on such a topic? I mean, not just stuff in general, but specifically that. And I started flipping through it and it was tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny print and there was a subscription card in the back, and I was thinking how it wasn't a really a big deal that it was in tiny print because I have a CC TV. And then I got the biggest present of all. Now in my dream all these presents were wrapped in the same kind of wrapping paper, that kind of like rosish wrapping paper that I used for Mom's TV. This present was so big that it could pass for a piece of equipment, you know, like the average size that the average box comes in that you get? Well, it was that size and I ripped it open, all excited, thinking it was going to be something like that. And it was a box, a gourmet box of chocolate-covered cherries that was just huge. I was feeling kind of a little bit let down, but yet a little excited at the same time because I was kind of expecting something else. [laugh] And then as this dream goes on, it got really cool. The mermaid doll that I have, you know how it just duh duh duh duh. [laugh] I don't know what I'm saying, but you know how that is. Well, I dreamt that I found the little bag that it came in and there were these magnets, like refrigerator magnets, that you had to install, like you had to glue them to the battery compartment door so that either to make them hold the charge longer or to make them do something else. I think it was to make them do something else, but these could have not been magnets. They were either magnets or chips that you had to glue in a certain place on the door, and I was trying to figure how to do this and I didn't know if you were supposed to glue them to the door or the side of the thing. So I was trying to find the instructions to figure that out, and there was this big, thick book that was like newsprint, like the SPC catalog, and it was yellow on the front and it had little pictures in it. And it was all these things that this company makes. It was like an exquisite ______ illusion company, for lack of a better term. But they made imaginative things that you would use in displays and setups that were based on movies, like for ""The Little Mermaid"" they had two or three other models similar to my doll, and they had a whole bunch of other things that were different things, like Arabian figures and stuff. And they had this other mermaid with a purple fin, purple shells and blonde hair, and I was writing down the catalog number because that's another thing that I would want for my birthday. And then I woke up. That was messed up, man. That's all I can say about that.",Negative
"My husband and I were looking for houses. One right uptown for $150/month. At first we thought we couldn't possibly take it, but it was very nice inside -- all white and cool, with some teak panels or something. In back was a large patio, some trees and grass, and a large, cool lake with some artificial islands in it. I was showing this lake to my daughter and we were walking around it toward a large rock, when suddenly a wave like an ocean wave broke over it and swept us up toward the house. My daughter was scared and I decided it was too dangerous for the children to live there, especially since the house -- the patio, anyway, was now completely surrounded by water.",Negative
"A New Home  I'm in a car at a stoplight with my brother Wally and other family members. The car is a stick shift. We're going uphill, turning at the intersection. Wally has a huge burger, drink, and side order that he has just picked up to go. He tells me it only cost him 35 cents on his card, some type of card. We drive down a road and talk with my mom. Our house has burned down, I understand. We go by a lake on which there are canoes and boats on the other side of this divided highway. My mom tells me our boat was lost in the fire. Someone is going to give Wally $12,000 for his car- a ridiculous amount of money for it. I react, asking why anyone would give so much for such a piece of junk. We drive from the highway, which seems to be the Thru Highway, going north from Superhighway 100 near by teammate Olie Kecker's house. We get to a neighborhood near Riverside school. I have seen a map with a thumbtack hole in frequently visited places. I see our home in Oak Valley and a tack hole worn in there. There are many other holes, including another heavily worn, near Riverside. It may be marked in a solid color, indicating a house. We arrive at a dark brown single story house, a few houses north from my friends the Hackers. My mom, Wally, my sister Ramona, and I are there. I follow someone who has or gets the key to the front door. We walk in to the living room. The carpet is coral colored. There is a collection of black and white china vases in the fully furnished room. We turn right into the kitchen. In the sink there is a white plastic bowl with salad in it, partially covered with a plastic bag. Who know that this is the doing of my aunt Elaine Grains, who was coordinating the preparation of this place before we arrived. There is a box of pet white rats in the kitchen. They belong to Ramona. I go into the basement. The floor is hard, the ceilings low, and the walls are finished off. There are three or four bedrooms in the basement. I look into each one. Some are connected to others such that one has to walk through one to get to the next. I disturb Wally, who is sleeping in a larger bedroom in the basement.",Negative

I said to Rudy, ""Unless this is the 'Plagues of Egypt' something is bad wrong."" He explained it was the 'fowl meal': crushed up dead birds that were dumped in the water for the fish to eat. That's why it was so bloody. I was desperately looking for a number in the yellow pages of someone who specialized in that type of clean up. Rudy said, ""It's OK, my father knows how to make it (the blood) disappear (by) swishing it with brooms in the water. It sounded odd but I knew it would work if my father figured it out.

Hostess remarks that she will have to get her other body and to meet her on the back porch. Hostess is still beautiful, but she has aged approximately 20 years. Subject proceeds to engage hostess in sexual intercourse. Due to the aging of the hostess the intercourse is unsatisfactory to subject, whereupon the subject replaces his pants and leaves. The subject now momentarily awakened and then resumed his night's sleep.",Positive
"The Invisible Terror  I'm in a bar with a friend and some men who work there. I flip a coin to try to get a free drink. On my first toss the coin lands on its side on my jeans, so I toss it again. One of the men says something about the correct direction to flip a coin. I get a heads on the second toss, which is what I had called. The coin looks like a penny, but has an entire body on it, instead of just a head. I wonder what kind of beer to get. The two men who work there aren't much help in figuring this out. They don't seem to want to give me a beer. One of them makes a comment about Busch Light and a case day. I have a shovel, which is like a spade with a flatter scoop. I point it at people, as if it were a gun, and jerk it back towards me, as if I had just fired it and it had recoil. There are some women in the bar. Several of them leave, and then come back in carrying crates of full milk jugs.  There is a princess-like girl that is 14 years old. She has many suitors who come to have sex with her. There is a woman who watches over the princess, like a maid or attendant. This woman is cute. I'm standing outside the window of the princess' room. The maid is in the room, but the princess is not. There is a man in the room too. The maid says that it's okay for the princess to have suitors during the day, but not at night. I climb in through the window. The mother of the princess arrives in a car outside. I crouch down, to avoid being seen. A young man in a delivery truck pulls up right next to the room. He takes a pair of jeans and tosses them into the room at the maid. He is courting the maid and she snubs him: she doesn't like him. The delivery boy walks into the room. I approach him, somewhat out of protection for the maid, but I don't necessarily think she wants me to do this. The boy is short and skinny. I tower over him. I ask him to teach me to walk sideways on some narrow, beamlike structure outside. We go to the edge of the room, outside. There is an army man walking up a ramp to the room. He is fairly dangerous and belligerent. The boy pushes me out onto the beam and pulls the pen that I always carry out of my back pocket. The pan is what will allow me to walk or stand slanted or sideways. I regain my balance and push the delivery boy into the arms of the army man, who is behind him. This seems to be doom or death for the boy. I run! I go away from the army man. I run to my home, go inside, and lock all the doors. I go upstairs, and then go downstairs. The front door is then wide open and the piano is playing by itself, as if an invisible person is playing it. I don't see a person, but someone must be there. I lash out, but touch nothing. I run outside with fear, wondering who or what is there. I see a lamb, a whale, and other objects that appear before my eyes. I get near the back door, where there is a sign. It has writing on it, something like, ""What is chasing me?"", or ""What am I chasing?"" I stop and think: what am I scared of? What part of me am I running from?",Negative
"I dreamed that I was in a classroom about to take an examination. The test was handed out on white printed folded sheets. I unfolded mine and read the single question printed there. I read: trace the importance of erasers on the control of audio-sound frequencies. With a sinking feeling I realized that I knew absolutely nothing about the subject. I seized my pencil with determination and began to do what so many students try to do on exams--bull around, as it's known. I recall writing authoritatively (hoping I could fool the professor). ""It will readily be seen by any intelligent person that erasers are of the most extreme importance, etc."" I was quite worried that I would be seen through and receive a low grade.",Negative
"I dreamed I was at my house one morning when the T.V. repairman came. Apparently I was outside in the carport when I heard the repairman fussing about something that my mother did wrong (as he was talking to my mother), which caused the T.V. not to work. When I heard him telling my mother these complaints, I came in from the carport and told him, ""Listen, your job is just to fix the T.V. so why don't you just fix it and quit complaining."" I seemed a bit angered at his telling my mother what she did wrong.",Negative
"Matthew and some of my family members were helping me to move back into my house on Lakeland Dr. It had been almost completely remodeled on the inside. It looked much newer.

It was mostly single women who lived on the cul-de-sac.",Positive
"31 Miles to Dalz  I'm up north in Franklin country, driving in a car to Hillston. It is around 10:00 am on a bright sunny morning. I look up and see the moon in the sky next to the sun. They are about one thumb's width apart, I judge. There appears to be a ""bite"" taken out of each of them. I think this is weird because they are never that close to each other. There is an alien face to the left of the sun. It is black with white eyes and a white mouth. I wonder where this is coming from, and then I turn around and see that the sun is reflecting off the windshield and bumper of the car behind me back into the sky. Ahead of me and to my right is what looks like my friend Nate Nelling's car. I pass it. Then I am in the car, and am passing a semi-truck. I am nervous about being in such a little car. I make a turn on the road when going almost 60mph. I feel the car kind of shake. The sun is really bright as we round the curve. I drive into a small town. The speed limit sign says 49mph. The town is just like Oak Valley when you drive in on highway 23. There is a baseball field and an AAA store on the right. There is a Food-n-Fuel and a bar on the left. But the town has a newer, cleaner, smaller atmosphere to it. A lot of things are colored bright blue. I look for a sign that will point me in the direction of Hillston, because I think I've gotten a little off track. There is a road sign saying Dalz, which is the name of a town, is 31 miles, with an arrow pointing to the left. I turn left, but stop to check the road map in my back pocket.",Negative
Our cupboard was overloaded with dishes. They were handing out over the shelves. I took an old style kerosene lamp off the ladder and put it on the table. I saw a _______ in the night sky I saw stars. I saw faces of women and a man float thru the sky. The man had a mustache. I saw a number on a side of a clock. It was #3225. This sight frightened me. I was flying as Johnny Kolesar walked. There seemed to be a picnic in the woods. Kotnik threw something at me. I was above him. I threw fruit at him from the air and hit him. He ran away.,Positive
"Zeffman Dies  I'm on the bridge that goes over the Main River near downtown Wilmerton with my friend Binky Ahmed. We are on the sidewalk. There are two policemen on the bridge. Binky tells them that our friend Lyle Zeffman got put in jail for a month for drinking. I am surprised. Then our friend Lyle is on the bridge near the policemen. He is drunk. He falls off the bridge, and drowns. The policemen don't do anything about this. Binky and I leave. We are riding on phone booth-like machines. The booths are tipped on their sides and have blades or wheels on the bottom. As soon as we are away from the police, I start to run. Binky falls behind. I run through yards and jump over fences. On some fences I jump, I feel I'm in slow motion, suspended in the air. I try to find the Burns County Fair, but I am disoriented. I am with my friend Elise Rooks. We are sitting on the ground on the east side of Wilmerton. We flirt. I really want to make out with her. I act silly, like I am a little drunk, in hopes that her flirtatiousness will get carried away. We are then at Elise's house. There is a phone call for me. At first I think it might be my ex-girlfriend Annie, but I can't tell from the voice. Then I realize it is my friend Nicole Peterson, who is at a camp in Connecticut. I'm surprised she calls me. She sounds like she needs a friend. My brother Wally is there and he listens on another phone. We put Nicole on speakerphone for a bit.",Negative

And he kept telling me that if I didn't get squared away, he was going to ship me out of there. And I remember saying that wouldn't be such a bad idea, to do that at all, because I don't particularly like it around there. It would have been worth it just to get away from him.",Negative

"This dream happened in Virginia on one of its many mountains. While walking on one of these mountains, a large brown black bear appeared before me. I immediately took off down the side of the mountain because I knew that a bear's front legs are shorter than his rear ones. So if he (the bear) had to run on a downgrade he would trip. Just when I thought I had escaped, my feet seemed glued to the ground. I remained almost motionless however hard I tried to make my legs move. The bear was upon me in an instant and at that time I woke in a cold sweat.",Positive
"At this point all I can remember of my dream last night is that we were all sitting around in the living room naked, like we do talking (?). And there were these people outside kind of milling around. A little later on when we put our clothes on, they ding-donged the doorbell. They kind of said that they were looking at us and that, I don't know, one guy was kind of real sarcastic and said, ""I made __________ over there."" And then they got a little more serious and said like, ""Well, you guys just ought to keep your pants on,"" or something like that. When we were out in the back yard and Dad wanted me to carry pepper spray when I go places, and I said, ""There's got to be a better way to defend myself.""

When I insisted that they gave me a pack of cigarettes, a drunkard came in and asked for cigarettes and the woman told him they didn't sell cigarettes and she went to the back of the store.

"The Illuminated Night  I'm in a barrack-like structure. I show a man where his bed is: next to mine. He has a body sheet wrapped around him for a sleeping bag. I have a small trash bin near my bed. The man has a sleeping bag. I'm outside sleeping. It's dark. I awaken. My friends Niles and Tim Zelling are there, in sleeping bags. I'm lying down in shallow water in a sleeping bag; the water comes up to my neck . I take big gulps of the water. Tim says he wouldn't drink the water because it's muddy. It's kind of muddy; I drank before I stirred up the mud on the bottom. There is lake to my left, and a bleacher-like area where people have gathered. Police are there. I leave the area I'm in and creep through the bushes on a path that turns towards the people. I see a tennis ball on the ground. I get pinesap on my hand as I walk; it brushed up against a tree. It's a well-lit night: the moon must be out, though I don't see it. I see the Brimson crew team on the lake. My friend Tom Napper is coxing. They row fast. They approach the shore, not slowing, and scrape the boat up onto the rocky beach. The boat they row has two main aluminum hulls, like and elongated pontoon.

"Friday. I decide I'm going to take a bath. I start the bath water and remember I need a certain piece of clothing that is in another room. I hesitate about leaving the water running, but decide to chance it. It's not far and won't take me long. I go out and down a long ramp to a big room that has counters like in a business office. I go to the back of the room to the bathroom, but the woman boss (Ann Bacon) is very agitated. They are very busy and I'm interfering. She says someone else is taking a bath and I must wait. I get anxious, wondering if my bathtub is overflowing. Finally, she reluctantly lets me in. I nod my head to the old skinny guy in the tub and say, ""Excuse me."" I get a piece of clothing and a purse off the shelf and go back out. I pass rows of counters. I bump one. It's on little wheels and rolls a little. I try to get it back like it was, but it won't, so I give up and hope Ann doesn't get upset more. I'm now walking up the ramp and I'm slow and tired. I try to walk faster, now very worried about how long I've been gone. The water is probably all over the floor and it will be a terrible mess to clean up, and I'm late already for an important something. I try to find an elevator and I do. It's in the library, but it won't go to my floor. So I get out and see stairs only. They go up, hit a platform and an escalator, conveyor belt thing as sloped down the other side, only it's rolling me back up to the platform. I go back where I came and finally get to my bathroom. The water is at the very top and has spilled over just a little. ""Just as I imagined it would,"" I thought. I take off my clothes and see two men in the room. I decide I have to go to the bathroom and pee. I say to one man, ""See we're like brothers and sisters. I can take off my clothes and pee in front of you."" I am a little uncomfortable, but feel trust that it's OK. [There's a real sense of trying to prepare for a special occasion and being late and many things going wrong.]",Negative

I put out heroic efforts, panting, running; it's hard to do. I pull myself step by step. The curb or railing is pink and I pull on it to get me up the hill. The guys get ahead of me. I'm sweating and exhausted. I come into a room. They are seated, drinking ice water and taking a breather. I just keep on going. I hope they don't notice I'm gone until I've gotten a good lead!

I was sitting at my desk waiting for class to begin when a girl I had been dating quite frequently entered the room.

As she passed behind me to get to her seat one of her girlfriends asked her where she got the fraternity pin which was quite prominent on her blouse. She replied that she was pinned to Dinny Bernaway while in Florida. I was quite hurt to hear this for she had turned me down when I had asked her to go steady a few months earlier.,Negative

"We were at work but it was really more of a class than a work and a whole bunch of us are in class with a teacher and we decided that we're not going to stay. A couple of us anyway, decide that we're going to leave early and just take off so it was about 1:30 in the afternoon, I kept looking at my watch, my Bell watch. And somehow we all ended up going to a party and there was a whole lot of us there, many of the people were also members of the Idaho Counsel of the Blind, which I am a member of and we were eating. We all had these bags of food and I was reaching in and grasping with my fingers, little mandarin orange sections and eating them and they tasted really nice and juicy and there was a candy bar but the candy bar felt different it had like a cut out rectangle on one side and it was flat like a regular candy bar on the other side and the rectangle felt like the whole shape of the whole candy bar, like a border on one side, raised up about a quarter of an inch. And you could feel the recess of the rectangle on one side and I said ""oh, I've never had one of these before"" and I ate it and it was good. We were all eating and I was eating a lot more than I had wanted to and I remember thinking, 'gee I shouldn't be eating all of this its too much' but I kept on eating anyway. We were celebrating S's birthday, he's the head of a magazine I get on tape, and I got to meet him once at a convention, and he wasn't at the party, which didn't matter, we were still celebrating his birthday anyway. The A was talking to one of the other people at the party and telling her that she really didn't want to do something that this other person wanted her to do, and that was unusual I thought, because A doesn't usually complain. About stuff. And I thought, that's good, because if she really doesn't want to do it then she shouldn't do it just because the person who's asking is blind and she's sighted.",Negative

"The place I am is either the library or a school or both - I both work here and am taking a ""class"" here (I think). I'm supposed to turn in a report of some kind, but I haven't done the work yet - I haven't had time. I need a piece of information, about how long was the average hospital stay of wounded soldiers in WWI (or is it II?), and I haven't found it yet. I'm in a room where I'm meant to be working, and not looking at books, but - as you know - if I see one I want to flip through it, see what it is. The book I've been looking at is open on the table - it's rather kid-oriented, lots of pictures and broken-up page formats, I look over the pages but I still don't see what I want. There's a lot of other books on this table, most of them old, looking like rebinds, I think they're all kid's books. I'm looking at the titles and find one that strikes me fancy, so I set it aside to look at later. [I'm not sure if it's that book or another, but I am looking at one more closely - it has to do with how to live with your family, in various situations - humorous style, like so many kid's books are in order to help get the point across.] I'm a bit frustrated, knowing I don't have time to get everything done and I'd rather just read for enjoyment. I realize I'll just have to be late with the report, it won't get done in time. Oh, I guess I could do the rest of the report without that information, but I want to get it all in having once thought of it. The old doubts creep in - am I indulging myself in perfectionism, or whatever it is? Do I have to do it thoroughly or not at all? Is it not all right not to do well? Or is this information really necessary and if I just applied myself wouldn't I get it right? Have I been lazy? Nuts. Anyway something different distracts me. Lisa's kite has gotten repaired and we're going to fly it. It's a standard kite-shape and blue - don't know what was wrong with it, but it was taken away for repair before we ever got it up and now this is a big event. I'm turning around and seeing that there are other people here, a fair number. We've gone into another room. This school is built like a stone park pavilion. It's a long open place with walls in between rooms but a walkway all along one (or both?) side(s). This, one end, is a kind of theater-room. It has a puppet stage and a couple of openings underneath it that lead backstage, they're curtained, one red, one blue, plain cotton, and an adult could get through them by getting on hands and knees. The people with me, it seems like they've come to observe or inspect something - we're facing the stage-end of the room. Without stage-sets or anything, you can see through to the outside. The rest of the room is empty except maybe for some props. There's a woman here, who looks something like Eleanor Parker - business suit, aloof, short hair, slightly disapproving, a taskmaster. There are a few people behind the stage. So the business of the kite comes up. People are gathering to see it go, and I'm wondering where Lisa is. Won't she want to be here? I see Becky come up, didn't she get Lisa someone to relieve her? Becky's looking very ritzy herself - hair in a classy knot on the back of her head. I go down the passage to see if I see Lisa - she's at the other end. For some reason I don't want Becky to know what I'm doing so I keep an eye out, and just casually step inside the room sideways rather than walking straight in. There's a lot of people in here - they seem to be at long benches crosswise in the room - I think they're all adults - it's not a class, exactly, but more organized than a library. Lisa is up at the front, helping people (pretty much as she does as a librarian), and I wave to her, mouthing the word ""kite"" and pointing. She sees and gestures a response - I guess she'll be coming when she can. I go back down to where we'll be flying the kite. There's a nice lot of people gathered, we're staying back under the roof of the building mostly, and looking out to where they've got the kite. It's a bare place with some ""dunes"", little hills, tufts of grass on. There's maybe 3 or 4 guys out there with the kite, very gung-ho. I notice Becky has her hair down now, I go back to an opening in a wall sort-of-place, where there's a bit of fence closing off the pavilion opening, and there's some bushes and other plants. I duck under and go up to the fence. There's another couple of people there, friends - one of them is a good-looking young man who's somebody's husband, and one of those people I privately daydream about. He's perched on a ledge and I go past him to my own position. Lisa still hasn't made it yet, but they seem to be determined to carry on anyway. The sky is clouding over, fast - it's getting darker by the minute and frankly even if it doesn't rain we won't even be able to see the kite if it gets up. But they're going on anyway. They start to run with it and bustle around, but can't get it up. Then I see a light, hear a click, don't know what it is at first - then I see what's happening. Since there isn't enough wind they're lighting a lighter underneath the kite to try to make hot air to lift it. This is stupid, of course, but I can't see any way of stopping them. What I'm afraid of is they'll set fire to the kite. I remark as much to my friends. They don't stop, of course, and the sky gets blacker and stormier and they disappear behind a dune on the left and there's a ""pfft"" sound that I recognize. It's the kite going up, of course, and that's all she wrote. There won't be anything left to save - that kind of flimsy paper just goes all at once. What a drag after all that work. Damn. And Lisa still isn't here, doesn't have any idea what happened. Blah. So we all start away from where we're watching, and wander on back to wherever.",Negative

I open it some and say, ""Boy, this baby sure doesn't like this!"" I feel a little sorry I'd gotten it in this predicament. [BL]",Negative
"I was with my husband. We were driving to this small town. It seemed to be up in the mountains and we came to a place where the road went and we had come down this street and the crossroads that we had come to was a small dirt road and you could turn to the left or to the right and we went to the left because it was a part of the road that we had never been down before and we just wanted to see where it went. We turned down the road and fairly soon after that, we had turned down it. It branched again and there was a dirt road on one side and we started going down that and there was a gate that blocked our way and it was some sort of National Forest or National Park. There were tables set up for picnics and everything, but it was closed and we were sort of indignant. We were talking to a young boy who was obviously working as a ranger just for the summer and asked him what this meant because we had been to 3 or 4 places just recently which were national parks or something and they had all been closed down, and since this was the busy season they should do their repairs at some other time. So he went off to consult with somebody and we came back and there were several people standing around besides us that also wanted to get in. Some people who were on the inside already, but still were standing there. The person that this ranger brought back was ranger also and took this hose and turned it on rather strongly and put the nozzle down against the lock of the gate and the pressure finally broke it open, so we went on in and there was an old house inside the park or whatever, and the ranger told us this was an old mountaineer's home and there was nothing historic about it. It had been left and there was some old furniture and stuff in it and anything we wanted we could buy for this nominal fee. So we went into the house along with this other family that we sort of took this instant dislike to for some reason. There was a grandmother and then the, her daughter or daughter-in-law and son or son-in-law and 2 of their children. I don't know what it was we disliked about them. I guess they were typical tourists or something and we thought we weren't. So we started rummaging around anyhow. There was this one big room. It was real dusty and there wasn't very much in it. There were some old caches that looked like they had been lying around the floor for 50 years or so and a few boxes of things and we started looking thru these and we found some things that were quite interesting. We found 3 little kerosene lanterns, the old-fashioned type, only they weren't exactly kerosene lanterns because they also had candles in them. Then we found some little knickknacks and bric-a-brac type stuff, these little salt and pepper shakers and little statues and such and we thought of taking some of those with us, but really there wasn't very much there that we wanted and besides the dust was bothering me. I have asthma and in my dream, all the dust and everything in the place was bothering me, which is sort of unusual for a dream. I don't think I've ever had a dream like that before. Anyway, we got our little collection of stuff and went out toward the door and ranger was standing behind a counter and cash register and we were going to pile the things there and let him add up the cost.",Negative

"Ellie introduces me to Jerome G. He and I like each other immediately. We hug and kiss and are very loving. He has a blue cat that looks at first like a spider and then is a cat. I pet it lovingly.

"I was at some kind of school or something. I can't remember what was happening, but I went into a small toilet cubicle - which was part of this room - to get changed. Some bad guys came and were stealing stuff and taunting people. I stood on the seat as they tried to reach under the cubicle door, but they knew I was in there and got in. I had a pen and was jabbing the guy with it as he got closer, then I sliced his neck with it. He fell to the floor and then I was worried what would happen when his friends found the body.",Negative
"The feeling is that I've been home in New Brunswick a long time and had just remembered that Betty, my first wife, has been divorced for a long time. I go over to her mother's house, more or less on the chance of something happening. As I look in the back kitchen window, I catch the eyes of both she and her mother. Her mother quietly nods a kind of accepted recognition. Betty comes outside with tears in her eyes and with both joy and kind of recriminations, ""You knew I was here; why didn't you come sooner?"" I awake with fright.",Negative
"A fragment. I was going with Bob Lieb somewhere on a trip, quite chastely, unfortunately. I think I kept trying to seduce him and he was completely unresponsive-like, rubbing my nipples against his chest as we slept naked together. At one motel where we stayed for several days, I tried to get the lady owner to come down in the price she charged us, telling her a real sob story which even made me cry as I told it. She said she could have charged us a lot less, but she wouldn't change the bill. Also in this dream my friend Diane said she was 19, and I didn't know whether to believe her or not, but I said that was more likely sounding to me, since she seemed so immature.",Negative
"I dreamt that my front teeth were loose and wobbled. Then I thought that I was chewing something hard. I spit what I was chewing into my hand and looked at it. My hand was full of blood and teeth. My mouth felt sore and swollen and I spit out what was in it. Again I saw the blood and teeth, but immediately my mouth felt full of hard bits again. I kept spitting and trying to get rid of the feeling, but it wouldn't stop. I was getting panicky and it seemed very real. I went in the bathroom and tried to drink some water, but immediately I had to spit and I couldn't drink. I became so frightened finally that I woke myself up.",Negative
"The name Toveson figures in this one. It's the name of an institute or a university in England. It reminds me of the Tavestock Institute. I think I'm reading a newspaper account of some kind of a power struggle between this American scientist and an English scientist. The English scientist has a job now and the American scientist is rumored to be going to get it, and it's because that he's giving six hundred and eight million dollars. He's a privately wealthy person, to the institute. The newspaper account is saying this poses an interesting problem for Toveson because this American does a lot of traveling. It's a time-honored rule at Toveson that no one ever leaves when they get there.",Positive

"I was over in the hospital. It seems as though I was working there and I was sick in some way. So I was sort of in the Employee's Health although it was run by a bunch of people I had known in the Biology Dept. when I worked there, especially the head technician. I was supposed to go down there for a couple of shots of flu vaccine. Whatever I had, although it was some sort of physical disease, it also seemed to be mental in some way. When I went down to Employee's Health, they were all real busy when I went in there at first. So I went out and had to come back again later. Somebody had given me this little pink pill to carry with me to show to whoever I found in charge there so they would know exactly what I wanted. And when I went back there, another person who I had known in the Biology Dept., she worked in the Pathology Dept., gave me a cup of water to take in with me. And I went in with my little pill and apparently I was going to have to dissolve this pill and drink it and then have these shots. Then somebody came over and noticed me. I told them what I wanted and it seems as though I was going to get the shots in a little while.",Positive
"I dreamed I was home in P--. I was talking with my mother and asked her the question if she were happy. She answered, saying that she wasn't very happy because she had not been able to do all the things in life that she had wanted, and also that she wished her children were at home. Interpretation Since I have been away from home, I have naturally thought more about my parents--wondering how happy they really are, etc. I have thought of all the things I want to do and see, and yet realized that probably many of these wishes my own mother once dreamed of--but they were never to be fulfilled.

"I rode my bike up a steep, narrow driveway to a house that was not my own. I think it was maybe a few houses down from my parents' house. My bike was a BMX freestyle bike. At the top of the steepness, the driveway flattened out and followed along the side of the house. The house was on the right, and to the left of the driveway was a three-foot wall of railroad ties that held back the soil, like a terrace. The yard was a hill that went up to the next-door neighbor's house. The house had unusual architecture like one of the college dorms. Right where the driveway flattened was a trapezoidal arch that formed a telephone booth-shaped gazebo with the railroad ties. There were no cars in the driveway. Suddenly, two women walked around the back of the house and towards the front of the driveway. I ran over to the gazebo corner with my bike. Since I was in their driveway, I didn't want them to see me. I peeked at them through a porthole in the gazebo wall. They didn't see me and walked around the front. I walked back to the driveway, underneath the arch. Then some other guy my age biked up the driveway. He asked me if there was anything cool back there like a ramp or anything. I said, ""No,"" hoping he would leave.",Negative
"I went to visit Chris C. He lived here in Indy. At first, it was just he and I. We didn't talk much. It was as if we didn't know what to talk about. There was food everywhere, almost as if it was on display just for people to take and eat. Lots of sweets especially. At some point Mother, Bev, and Rachel S were there too. We were mostly playing with Rachel S. Bev had a clip-on ponytail for her that Rachel S wouldn't let us put on her. However, it was very cute. She also had this little pair of eyeglasses, which she also wouldn't keep on. Chris C sold insurance. Once we got to his house, he sat in a wheelchair to make it easier to get around. Even though we didn't talk much, I suggested we get together more often. I was trying to be nice because I felt he was very lonely. He seemed to be appreciative of the offer to get together more often. I told him we had one staircase and then wondered what I was thinking and said we could get by without using it. Again, he seemed happy for the offer. I asked him what kind of insurance he sells so I could refer people to him. He said all kinds. At some point Brian F showed up. He couldn't believe all the food. He wanted some but didn't take any. I very much wanted a cream filled donut, but didn't take one. I did take a snickerdoodle. I didn't want Chris C to see that I had it even though he had told us to help ourselves. When we were getting ready to go, he loaded up this big basket/cart full of food for Bev. The items I remember were three boxes of tea, larger than VCR's. I also asked about his apartment Community to see if it was adults. I told him I was thinking about a new apartment where it would be adults only. As we were leaving in the car I realized I had looked at them once before and didn't care for them. They were brown and had brown wood front porches with railings. They were all attached to each other.",Positive
"Cats - moving from one place to another - two of them, somewhat awkward - not clear - at one point I go back to my family house and see my cat there? I'm feeling relieved that he/she is still there. While there I'm trying to use a device on the end of a hose, dirty, like car-repair tools are - you're supposed to press a little nub and (compressed air?) comes out. It's not working, and I go to a garage (or ?) and while the person I'm with talks to the mechanic I try out the one at the garage and it works so well I nearly fall over. Then I try mine again and it definitely doesn't work right. Sometime I go to a friend's house - I'm carrying something - she takes me to meet her parents - her father says he knows who I am and doesn't want me in his house - I think he says he doesn't want me around his daughter but he can't actually forbid her and I think she says so.

"I'm not sure how this one started either, but Willow, Xander (both from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and I were outside in the street running from people. There were crowds everywhere which we had to run through. He took a car and was going ""20 km/h over the limit"". We drove slowly past the cops, who were preoccupied anyway. Then we were walking. We went into this building and we went to leave (and it was just Xander and I now), but we saw people running down the street and were near the entrance, so we had to find another way out. There was a small gap where a window should be, which I could fit through. We left through there. We were then at some house/cabin thing in a forest. I got a phone call and it was from some dude asking me to steal a gun back. I said no and that I thought it was wrong. He kept going on about it so I said that I'd do it. We went back to this room and there were lots of people. They congratulated me because it was the right answer. Buffy decided to go out with Xander. The next day, they were both wearing glasses. I was in a library; they saw each other and waved. Cordelia and Buffy were wearing the exact same outfit. Cordelia saw what Buffy was wearing, some kind of skirt and a ""pie shirt"". I was at university, but it was different. I was in the computer room which was huge and like a library on the second floor. I needed to know a room number and asked Classmate-F-14, who gave me the number. I checked the door and it was a 5 digit number. I went back to the computer, and Lillian was on it. I pulled the chair out, aggressively, but then I realized she was only sitting there temporarily. There was a photo of me naked on the computer. Mom and I were then at some vacation? We were at a cabin and Ezra fell asleep. I was going for a walk and there was a woman with a dog. She asked if I'd seen her dog. I had seen her before. I said no and to look behind something that was in a front lawn. I asked what kind of dog and she said ""Alaskan Malamute"" and I said they were cute. There was a park and around it was a building.

Dad took us to this place with lots of houses. We were looking for house number 9. In it housed cousins of ours. We had met one of them before when we were little because the Dad had two brothers.

"I went in to the CAS office. I was wearing my plaid flannel pants and a T-shirt. I went to the restroom. I felt really bad about how I looked. I wanted to hurry up and get out of there before anyone saw me. But when I went from the restroom I wanted to hurry back to my office and hoped that no one saw me. But when I got ready to walk back to the office I had to walk past two other offices and through one office. Of course, the receptionists in all three of those offices were all three women who were dressed very professionally. I think I went down there twice. The second time I realized I didn't have to go through the one office to get back to my office. There was a very narrow hallway behind the office walls. The wall was glass but at least I didn't have to walk through that office. When I went back the second time, when I got to the one office, the office was locked and all the lights were turned out. Earlier I had seen the receptionist fixing her hair and stuff. She had put some rollers in the front of her hair and taken them out. She was wearing a red business suit. When I came back the second time that office was locked, dark. Then I got to our office and the lights were all turned out. I worried for a second that Bill C had left and locked the door. Fortunately, he hadn't locked it. He had just turned the lights out. So I went in, turned the lights back on and went into my office.",Negative

Then the cops came and they were not after us, but were inquiring if Pete's baseball team wanted to play a certain team because they wanted to show Pete's team they could beat them. A lady was looking for a certain man and later chose another, saying, ""It is he who I want."" A young fellow said he was fired from the track for picking long shots, $180 one's.

"We (my whole family) were at someone's house that I don't know. They had three baby food jars with one huge spider in each jar. Somehow all the spiders got away and we were looking for them. I found the first one on a shelf and as soon as I saw it, I was paralyzed (frozen), and I barely got away before it bit me. The second one was on a tree branch and we caught that one, but we only saw the third one on the ceiling. Setting: It was at someone's house that I don't know, and they had a big house with at least one huge tree growing in the house. Characters: There was a family of five that I don't know, my mom, my dad, my brother (I think), me, and three huge spiders that are very poisonous, with brown and black stripes. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. The whole dream, I was scared that the spiders would hit me and worried that we wouldn't find all three of the spiders (which we didn't).",Negative

"I am outside, in the midst of a few small frame houses that may be out in the country, but not far out - certainly they're not in town. It's very ""family"" out here, everybody's close. I'm going toward one of the houses - is it my house? I think I'm just staying here on a visit. Between me and the house is a strange being - a girl with fur. I'm not thinking of her as a ""cat-girl"", but that is the sort of fur - I don't really know if she has a tail or not. (I may have thought it up after I woke up.) She's also very friendly, and we like each other a lot, though for a moment when we came together I was apprehensive. We talk a bit - I don't remember the conversation, but it's something to do with the reason I'm here, which is a wedding or something. In any case, someone is in transition. We go to another house where there's a gathering of people for this event - we seem to be helping pack up to move out of the house. There's an atmosphere rather like Christmas here, with people and things about. (The girl with fur has now changed to regular skin - she has dark, short hair, kind of pretty, lively, we are friends.) We are in one room - the living room, I guess, and I go into the next room, which is darker, and there's a group of things on the floor to deal with - I think some of them are presents, and there's wrappings about. Interesting stuff, and I believe there's wine bottles.",Positive
"I am late to teach a Sunday School class, and am not prepared for the class.  The only thing I know to do is to assign each person to read a different chapter or different story in the book, and have them talk about it.  But I feel that that is obviously a waste of class time to do something that they could have done at home in preparation for the class if they had been told to do so, and I am afraid someone will complain.  Carl Scheibe is in the class, which surprised me, because there are different levels, like in language classes, and I think he should be in a higher level.  There is some scheduling conflict, though, that necessitates his being in this class.  I am really embarrassed about being unprepared in front of him.",Negative
"Spitting Gas  I'm crossing a muddy river with a bicycle. The river is coming from melt water. I slip and fall, almost going in a deep part of the river. I get up, and hang onto the mountain bike with one hand. I slip again. The bottom of the river is slippery. I struggle to get to the side of the river, and I do. There is a stairway with metal pegs sticking out. I can use the pegs to climb.  I'm in a room with two men. The room is sealed off. The door is locked. The room is a puzzle or a maze. There are a couple switches on the wall. One of the switches released a harmful liquid that drips down through the stairs. I find a switch that released a gas. There is a lighter switch above or below this one. I find two sticks of dynamite that look like little red paint cans, or flame cans for camping. I find three lighters. I place a stick of dynamite in front of the locked door. I then spit out of my mouth a trail of gasoline leading away from the dynamite. My friend Niles Zelling has a book of matches. People have been approaching, which has made me hurry when doing this. Niles lights a match and tosses it on the gas. The gas ignites the dynamite, which blows the door open. Two men were coming near there. They go into the new room with us. We take all the extra supplies we have found. In the next room I find some wine bottles that have our homemade wine in them.

All of a sudden the engine sputtered and I realized that we were out of gas. We lost altitude fast and as we neared the ground, one of our wings struck a high-growing tree. In a moment I realized the results of the crash. Our plane was a complete mess and furthermore John was dead. I heard another plane flying overhead and somehow began signaling with smoke signals.

I am going to a graduation program in a church. It is not an actual graduation but I have a white gown that I lay over the seat because I have to go to the bathroom. The bathroom is downstairs in a dirty cellar that you get to by going down a ladder. The toilet is just a hold in the floor and everyone can see me. Kids tell me adults must use the other toilet. I go back up and finally find it but it is filthy. I think a church should have a better bathroom. I use the toilet and go back to the ceremony but all the others are now marching forward. My gown is gone and a lady tells me someone took it because I left. I am not very upset. Just disgusted. Everyone in the ceremony gets little bags of sample products as gifts at the end.,Negative
"I was preparing to teach a class.   It was only a writing class, but it was at a section of a prestigious Development Bank, so I was more concerned about the preparations because I knew I would have sophisticated adults in the class with high expectations.  Trouble is, I had not even prepared the syllabus, and I didn't know what textbook I was going to use or what I was going to do to fill the time during the first class.  Moreover, I couldn't find appropriate clothes to wear.  None of the shirts were white, and none of them went well with any of the slacks on hand.  When I finally got an outfit together that I thought would work, and put it on, I found the legs of the pants came down only just slightly below the knees, they fit too tightly, and one leg was a different shade from the other.  The same problem arose with socks.  When I finally found a pair that I thought would be satisfactory (and this whole outfit had a kind of yellowish-green base), and I put them on, I found that they had such big holes in them that my feet would be uncomfortable in shoes.  It was 2:00 when I started trying to get everything together, and now it was 2:15, and the class started at 2:30-downtown.  I was in a faculty office where I used to work.  Several teachers were there, but the only one I remember is Patty Phillips.  To make things even more stressful, her sister (named Tess) was in the next room, and Patty wanted me to meet her. Before I left for the class, I tried to find Mary Kodd, who was now the director again, to confirm the schedule and find out the room.  I didn't find her, but I found some guy I knew from the Foreign Student Advisor's office on campus.  He was short, not very old, but with gray hair.  I didn't think he would know what I needed to know, but I asked him anyway.  Turned out he was now an assistant director,, and he had actually taught the course for several years.  He said the class started at 3:30, not 2:30.  That was a relief, but it only gave me time to get down there on time, not to prepare the class.  I got there somehow, still extremely anxious about what I was going to do in the first class.  Everything I could think of, I thought they would already know.  I decided to start with correction symbols, even though I was embarrassed about it for a first day topic, and I knew I had a handout with everything on it, but hadn't brought it with me.  I started with sp for spelling error.  Looking at their faces, I knew they expected more.",Negative

"This alien girl had a container full of white powder. She had killed some people. There was a red pie with strawberries and the alien loved strawberries.

"I dreamed that I was uptown in a town that somehow was a cross between my hometown and some small town in the mountains. I was going to go shopping in this town in a big department store, but before I did I was going to take a long walk somewhere. It was in the afternoon and I had quite a bit of time so I started walking sort of out of town in a direction I had never walked in before. The minute I got on the back streets and off the main street of this town it started looking like a great big city instead of a small little mill town or something. The roads that came in were dirt roads and I was going down all these dirt roads to another little town, then that was supposed to be not very far off, just a few miles. And I was starting to do this when I realized I wouldn't have time to walk to this town and back and besides I was really too tired to do this, so I turned around and came back onto the main street of town in a different way from the way I had come before. Across the street to the other side. Then I was walking with my husband and with my sister, who was here visiting us this weekend, and we were walking down the street and we saw this little shop and it was very easy to distinguish among the stores on the street because it had this very high and narrow tower with this little thing on the top of it, a very phallic-looking tower all painted yellow and blue and red, very gaudy and as we came up to the door of the little restaurant, or whatever it was, we saw that there were 2 display windows there, and this man was standing out, the man who owned it, was standing out under it, the doorway with some peaches in his hand and was putting the peaches on display in the window so everybody could see the type of peaches he had. They looked real good, but we decided not to go in there. This was incidentally a lesbian temple around, is what we called it. There's a place in my university's town called the Temple where these male homosexuals are supposed to congregate and this is the lesbian room. So we homosexuals are supposed to congregate and this is the lesbian room. So we walked down and we came to another little pizza shop, this was a modern little shop where the man was standing out in the doorway of his shop too and he had some pizzas on display, but they were rather unusual because all the sauce was inside. The crust was in two layers and all the sauce was on the inside and he had a variety of things he would put on these pizzas for you, but he didn't have any pizzas with all these things displayed and I told him he would probably do better business if he would start displaying this type of pizza. Then I guess we walked on and then or at some point earlier in this dream, I was by myself again and it was earlier in the day now and I was going to go into these stores, especially this one big department store, to look for maternity clothes. This because when my sister was up here, she dated somebody and they went to the Temple room",Positive

For the last one I had to go to the 'cnoctory'.   There, my old roommate Chelsea was sitting on the ground finishing off what she had to do.  A pink elephant with spring body that walked sideways over itself.  We moved on to a shaded café.  There were little compartments.  I put my little booklet, gloves, my possessions to represent me in one.  Then swimming.  We reached Lake Powell-heading towards the Rainbow Bridge.  I got slammed into a stalagmite.  We went around it.  From behind, there was some sort of mass attack.  I was pulled along in the current.  I saw a sign say something like Zaire.  There were some small statues, about a foot tall.  If you gave it part of yourself, they'd come alive.  I told Chelsea to use one.  You had to give five things.  She said, ""No, you., and pointed to one that took two items.  I found out what it wanted.  I don't remember the first, but breath was the second.  I gave it, and fell, weak.  The little statue guy came alive and defeated our enemy before crumbling and turning back to stone.  The danger was in how much you give.  The weakness, and would they give back?

"It was a hot afternoon on a Sunday and my friend and I (a male friend) wanted to go swimming. We couldn't find a place to swim, so we decided that we'd go to a hotel where I used to work in the summertime, go to the pool. So someone told us to ask for the pool manager because he was a new manager, and I didn't know him. We went to this hotel and we walked around the side of it through the pool. To get to the pool, we entered a sort of lobby and then we went on to a patio. The pool man was at the far end of  the pool and he was vacuuming it, the bottom of it. The pool was extremely dirty. There was algae on the bottom. It was about half full. We went up and asked him about the pool and he immediately started talking about politics, about the presidential nominations and senators and just general political talk. But apparently he told us to go to another hotel, the DeLido Hotel, which was, we could see it from where we stood. It was down the beach. So we talked a little more about politics and then we got ready to leave to go to the DeLido to swim. Around the pool were lounge chairs. They were about half filled with people, but no one was in the pool. It was a very hot day, and as we started to leave, we had to go through two doors, one had a little square window in it. It was a wooden door. The window was about four inches square, and then there was another heavy wooden door. Then we were back in the lobby. As we opened the first door, the pool man kept on talking about politics and we couldn't seem to get him to stop. So we finally had to sort of shut him out in the pool area, so we could get back in the lobby in order to leave. So as we shut the last door, there were political figures in the lobby, politicians and mayors. There were about three of them. They were going to consult with this pool man on some problem that they had. My friend and I thought generally that he was an expert in politics. As we shut the door, the politicians got mad at us because they wanted to go out to speak to him and we were shutting them out. All this time while he was talking, he had a broom. First of all he was vacuuming when we first saw him, then he had a broom in his hand when we left and was sweeping the patio. So as we left he was talking to these politicians, giving them advice, and then we walked out in the big lobby. The lobby was in the back of the hotel instead of the usual lobby which is in front. We walked out to the car, which was my car , but it was a convertible, a white convertible. That's all I can remember.",Negative

Ramona says, ""Hi Kari"" to her as she passes. The woman kind of says a snotty hi, but she essentially ignores Ramona. Ramona starts to raise her photo for the woman to see, saying, ""Do you want to see..."" The woman continues walking away, ignoring her. I think this woman is not a very nice person: is conceited. Ramona is being very friendly: making an effort to get to know people. I think if Ramona keeps doing this she'll meet some good people. I'm going to talk to Ramona about financial aid, since I've been through the process.",Positive
"I was at school already, that I was in homeroom and we had to fill out these forms which they called ""desk-writing forms"" that told your GPA last year and some information about yourself, and that they were going to grade us on that. And somebody was showing me mine from last year and I couldn't really read it. It was like diagrammed out, though. And then we were watching some kind of a movie, and then Melinda came and looked at me and said, ""Let's go."" And then I'm riding in a brown car with her, with brown seats in it. And we go to this restaurant and we're ordering this steak burger thing and all of a sudden she disappears, she takes off. And then I woke up.",Negative
"I was in a small clothing shop on University Drive across from my alma mater, with my wife Bonita.  Helen Gamble was there too, smoking a cigarette.

I asked her when she had started smoking, but I don't recall her reply.",Positive
"I'm looking for Melissa G (really Clare K). I go to her mother's house and look into the kitchen window. Her mom is doing dishes. She tells me to wait at a campground. I go there and see her mom driving her kitchen over to me. I'm quite impressed! It's a mobile unit that she unstrapped from the house. I get in, it's cute, wooden and we drive back to the house. I go in and see large windows. I look into the toy room and she says, ""Go ahead, go on in."" I go in and look around. I see ceramics she's made on the wall. Some have price tags and I think about buying some. I see a wood stove and a kiln. I say, ""Oh is this a kiln where you nest the wet clay mold into the embers and cook it?"" She says yes, then, through the windows I see Clare, red fluffy feathers. She's pretty and she's annoyed with me for being at her mom's. I explain, then I hear a small black-haired baby girl in pink crying. I pick her up and rock her, singing, ""Sugar Baby"" over and over. The mother of the baby is annoyed. I didn't ask permission and she sings a different song, ""Sug--"" a short version of Sugar. I match her song! Then I have to remember I have a meeting tomorrow with Melissa G and repeat that over in my head. Clare tells me, ""It's just a van,"" when I comment on her mother's interesting kitchen.",Negative

"We were out the back of the old house. For Ezra's birthday, Mom bought him a $350 chair, $135 pair of 'remote control' shoes and 'dream boots'. The dream boots were like a soft pair of thongs which also massaged his feet. He seemed to like it, then let me try them. He tried the remote control shoes. Mom controlled them and then he just stomped out the front. I yelled at Mom saying 'why the hell did you spend all that money on him and you just give me $150?!"". I followed him out and he had thrown bits of the shoes around. I picked it all up and there was a small square bit of cardboard that flew off. It flew up over the roof, so I ran out the back and asked ""You can't take it back without that?"" and she couldn't, so I walked around to find it. There was a big park behind the house. I walked to the other side of it and I saw it stuck between two bushes. I went back and said ""you better be able to take it back"".",Negative

As I am sliding and falling, I notice lots of docu,ments and papers. I see words that say church and realize these men have stolen important papers from the church. The men are looking for me, and I lie still in the undergrowth hoping they don't see me. Then other people start searching for me too, punk teens and so on. I start running through the woods and scramble up to the road. The church men are there and want me to come back to the church with them. I say no. I don't want to. I just want to leave.

"I had a dream that I was on a bus or train somewhere, can't remember. But I was really nervous I was going to miss my stop; maybe I had missed it the week before when I was making the same commute. Anyway, when I got off the train, I guess I was in the right place. There was some sort of party or gathering. But anyway, Calvin was there and I was supposed to hook up with him. I wanted to too, but there was some sort of understanding between the two of us that we were going to hook up, even though we've never talked before. It was as if we were just going to act on the sexual tension and there didn't have to be any sort of explanation. He was shirtless, but had on his white baseball cap. He was holding a peach colored silk sheet and was waiting for me or something. I think I was sort of confused, but I got back on the train and then I woke up.",Negative

"I was in what first seemed to be the balcony of a movie theater, then turned out to be the upper deck of a baseball stadium.  Mickey Mantle was coming to the plate and getting a thunderous standing ovation.  He hit a home run, and his batting helmet flew off into the crowd behind home plate.  Before running the bases, he went back and asked for it.  To my surprise, the kid who caught it gave it back.  I guess Mickey needed it for running the bases, according to the rules, even though he had hit a home run, and that he would return it to the kid when he returned to home plate.  When he rounded third base, he held up one hand in a ""Hook 'em, 'horns"" gesture, and several people near me started booing and shouting obscenities, giving him the finger, and spitting at him.  Two kids were hanging on the railing.  I got mad and went up and shook the railing-and one of them fell off, out of sight.  I was a little scared, but not much. Then I left, but was accosted by some boys under the stands who told me I would have to come into a room with them and take my punishment, which was to let them beat me up.  I sort of felt I deserved it, but I was a bit squeamish about getting beat up.  I noticed that all the boys were young and small, though, so I went in.  My daughter Christina was with me, which was bad.",Negative
"Ezra was staying at Mom's. First, I was at home I think (maybe not). I was on the computer looking for 'disturbing movies'. There was some Asian guy and a girl too and they were pretty fluent in English. She asked what 'film' was and I said ""Same as movie"". There was a site with a list of movies. There was a movie that was short and it said people pooped in other peoples butts and so I thought I'd look for it. I found Part 1 and 3 on Youtube. I watched part 1 and it was lame. I figured they must've taken the good stuff off. I was telling Dad about it and we downloaded some movies. Then, I was back at Mom's. I was going to bed and Ezra decided he wanted to watch TV loudly. I said I can't sleep with that on. I complained because I had to get up at 6am. He refused to turn it down. Mom was on the phone trying to help. Darren was trying to convince him too. Cuddles was sitting on their bed. He had to get up at 4am. In anger, I punched the wall between my room and Ezra's. I found a soft spot but it didn't break. Ezra said if Mom couldn't sleep through it, then he'd know it was too loud. I said ""She sleeps through Darren's alarm every morning! It wakes me up all the time"". Soon after, we settled the argument and all went to bed.",Negative

I was at the Technical College. We were in a computer lab but had another room we were in too. Frederick had some idea for a story involving me and I didn't want to be in it. Hubert was in the room and under a blanket. He got up and I saw his butt when he got back in and I squealed and he put clothes on as he laughed. He complained that people had called him gay and his family complained that he was in effeminate and I said it wasn't a bad thing. I was talking to Fletcher about leaving or something. I wanted to edit something but the labs were full. Bev also complained about something someone else was doing.,Positive

We saw a couple of ropes stretched between the two cliffs above the falls, and finally realized when I saw a man sitting on it (this man sort of flew off into space) that it was a bridge and our mule trip would go over it. This was sort of frightening and I didn't know if I really wanted to go.",Negative

We pass many people lined up on the streets to watch the parade. Finally we realize we've gone too far. I do see a place behind us that has music and big klieg lights. I figure that must be the place. We walk back to that place and see several circles of people dancing in bright and colorful costumes, but no turkeys. Now we go up some stairs into a building and find children in a circle to do the kid turkey roundup. We see the kids trying to catch baby turkeys. Charla goes into the circle. I see a turkey chick (which looks pretty much like an eagle or owl) on the back shoulder of a boy. Now Charla has her turkey and we decide to head back home, only now we are flying in a plastic laundry basket. We are looking at this new city called Yamhill which is all manmade. Patricia is saying that it is a shame that underneath all this beauty and modern convenience are debris and decay. Hidden beneath the pretty buildings and the manmade lakes are piles of rubbish.

The motor is left on, idling. I am concerned and ask the girl to turn off the key. My father shouldn't have left it running. The girl finally does it. Then a friend, perhaps Shannon comes down the road. I realize I had left her behind. I try to make up for it and tell her where we will meet for the party. I have a map. I point to the fossil resort across the state. We get there. Now it is like an Ricardo and friend are going to an important party where venture capitalists may be. I am trying to dress to go there.

"I don't remember the first part of the dream. But I remember the end. I was at my circus class, and they needed three people between 90-120 lbs. I was one chosen. We climbed up like a 20 foot tower, and stood on something. I can't remember what. I looked on either side of me and saw Will (a boy in my real circus class), and a person, boy or girl, who was familiar, but I don't think she was real. We held waists, then jumped from the platform thing. We floated gently down, then slammed onto the teterboard (a circus apparatus) and catapulted the person on the other end into the air (Bill). Then, we floated up again, into the air, and flew slowly, barely missing hitting Sandy and Alexis (my contortion partners) and landed smoothly on a crash mat. Setting: In the gym I work out in.

I got in the car behind my father's in order that I might drive it away before the policeman placed a ticket on it. The policeman got on his motorcycle and pushed the car backwards. I immediately moved forward and crashed through a pink light. Then I found myself trying to drive the car down a narrow aisle in the 5 & 10 cent store. A cashier asked me to leave and I did. I got out on the sidewalk and the car was transformed into a bicycle which I rode down the sidewalk. I passed an Army Surplus Store outside of which four girls (in their 20's I would say) were modeling army fatigue outfits. Interpretation One Wednesday, September 28, I drove a friend to the police station so that he could pay a parking ticket fine. This incident probably explains why I dreamed about getting a parking ticket. When driving it is difficult for me to judge how narrow the driving space is. I guess the 5 & 10 cent store aisle would represent a very narrow space through which I was trying to drive. Answers to questions 2. I felt embarrassed in this dream3. 4. 5.

She's a little like Amanda, leaning toward the dotty side, older but won't act like an old woman. Her living room is smallish, a little dark with only a couple of table lamps lit (it's night-time) - flowered couch down the side, coffee table piled with books and notebooks.

She's a regular fixture herself and has a kind of professor-status.] I've come in a bit late. The class she's been teaching is just leaving, they're milling a bit. The teacher's not visible, she's probably in another room. One kid (tall, reddish-blonde, swaggery) says she's through for the night, too late, or words to that effect, but I know she needs to see me (or vice versa? or mutual?), so I'm gonna stay. She'll be out. Meanwhile I pick up a book off the coffee table to look through. I thumb through it and light on a particular page. It's a kind of who's-who, and has little bios of people. This one is describing Alan Nagy and has a picture. At first I only glance over it idly, noting the expected, that he has a degree in psychology, went to such-&-such university. Then I look closer, because the picture doesn't seem to fit, and realize that he was actually only noted for psychology on the side. His main focus was art, and this picture shows a huge sculpture being lifted upright with scaffolding. It must be bronze - looks it - and the caption says it's eight feet tall.

Lately, I had noticed she was bringing much food to the house, and that a number of packages were being delivered to the apartment, too. I decided then to do a little sleuthing. I took a ladder and placed it against the bedroom window. I carefully climbed up and just as I thought, there was a man sleeping in the bed. His face looked familiar to me but I couldn't remember from where. That night, I was reading the newspapers; and there across the front page was a picture of the man I had seen with a bold caption of ""Wanted"" above it.

"It was Audrey or Barbara that was small, about 8 years old, and had a death grip on Bob's throat. I yelled to let go, but she didn't heed it and I heard Bob moan and gasp for air. So I grabbed her hands and wanted to loosen her grip, but she held on. Then I was really going to work on her when I awoke. I was driving around, then I seemed to be in some kind of trouble. I wanted to escape with an engine and as I backed up, a car uncoupled and went down over a hill. I mingled with the police and people. I saw a girl lying on her back nude and I could see her vagina. The car got away from the engine. I heard 1st. I saw someone put up 4 fingers.",Negative

She had her entourage with her. One was an Indian woman who didn't have her ""hide your face"" outfit, so she draped beach towels around her head in the fashion of women from ancient India. I found a tattered piece of paper with sitting on the floor. I said, ""Is this yours?"" I said, ""Dora told me."" Liz was in the high school office tacking green tickets to the bulleting board.

I wonder for a moment if they are lesbian. A man nearby doesn't approve. I need to find a bathroom. I'm at a University, maybe a building like Autzen Stadium. I go down lots of halls looking for an accessible bathroom. Then I see a book stall where they sell writing things. I see the pens and am now looking for the right pen. I see the cheaper ones and hope to find a good-feeling pen there, but am drawn to the really pretty ones that are more expensive, fountain pens with clicker tops and feathers attached to the cap. They are special pens to be used at special occasions where there are guest books to be signed. But I will use this pen for my writing. I test it out and like the way the wet ink looks on the paper, only it spots a few blue ink marks on my hand. I kind of like that, a mark of a writer. Then the ink thins out and it's scratchy on the paper. Maybe this is the demo pen and I could find one that writes more consistently better. I find a colorful one with iridescent colors, but it has a kind of rough, scratchy feeling when I try it. No good for me. Needs to be a smooth ride.",Positive

She says the name of some Spanish sounding city beginning with P, and I somehow knew she was Hispanic before I asked her. I asked if she's lived in the United States since birth, and she says, "" No."" For some reason, she laughs continually about the fact that I'm paying so much attention to her. She says she'll see me at Model UN. Then I'm in a room where a model United Nations meeting is about to start. I was confused by the time of year. It seemed too early in the year for the nearby university United Nations to be taking place. I was hoping I hadn't missed something, because I haven't even done research. I didn't even know what country I was in. Then, I realize we were just having a ""draft"" to choose the countries we would be representing. I see a few students from Plainview High, including Riley. I think I talk to him, but I don't remember the conversation right now. We go to another room with a big table and chairs around it. I sit, and it looks like the red haired girl is going to sit next to me (I don't know why I thought that) and her friend comes over and tells me what sounded like, to some extent, ""Stop flirting with her."" Now I'm bringing a suitcase downstairs out of an unfamiliar school. I decide to take a different stairway than everyone else at one point, and come out in essentially the same place, one floor higher.

I go inside the building, where Mrs. Lear is there (in a conversation) and there's a computer terminal right by the door. So, I log into my account and send her a message asking which direction to go.

One of them that I knew, this boy named Scott in my French class. Why we were being chased I'm not exactly certain. We were being chased thru this huge classroom, class building on campus, not an actual one, but just one in my dreams. It involved this running thru classrooms and in and out of classrooms and up and down these stairs, being pursued and not knowing when you saw someone coming toward you if this was one of your pursuers or one of your friends.

"It was my first day back to work at CAS after a few week leave of absence. I went into the office building. The office was on the second floor, unlike in waking life. I decided to take the stairs rather than the elevator. As I got to the top, I looked toward the CAS office and couldn't see the receptionist desk like I usually can. The front wall is all glass, though in the dream the wall was about twice as long as in waking life. I wondered why I couldn't see the receptionist desk. There was a lot of sun shining in through an outdoor window so at first I thought that was why I couldn't see it. As I got closer to the office suite door I realized I couldn't see the receptionist desk because they had put up a partial fabric wall, the type that is sometimes used to create cubicles in offices, all along the front glass wall to hide employee desks. Even so, they no longer had a receptionist or reception desk. I went in and walked behind the wall. They had two or three rows of desks with two or three desks in each row. Bryan N was working at one of them. Bill C had made these changes while I was away so I didn't know where he wanted me to work now. Bill C came out of his office and walked me to the desk where he wanted me to work. There was one row of desks in between the one where Bryan N was working and the one where I would be working. He sat down at the desk and began doing something on the computer. He realized there was a problem and was becoming very aggravated. As always, he began snapping at me. I realized that he and Bryan N had made some changes to the computers while I was gone and what they did was causing problems. Bill C realized this wouldn't have happened if I had done this and he always hates it when I can do something that he can't, especially if he decides to do something different than what I recommend and it ends up not working out or causing a problem. His way of dealing with it is to get angry with me. I realized that it was not the computer I had before I left and suspected that was part of the problem. Bill C denied that it was a different computer. I could tell by the look on Bryan N's face that something was up and then he asked what difference it would make. I told him that my old computer was built to handle the capacity of all the software I need to do my job. Then he admitted that he had taken my old computer because he knew it was better than the one he had been using. Now he was upset because he had to give my computer back and because he had been caught. He was being rude and snappy as he prepared to switch the computers back. Bill C was acting as he always did when he didn't want to acknowledge something. The office is also much longer than in waking life. There are a number of large rooms as you walk the length of the office. Bill C had hired quite a few people. He had hired three just to manage training materials and to conduct training in our office.",Negative

"I was walking along a street (I don't know where). I stopped as I saw a short distance in front of me a manhole with one of those wooden horses used by road workmen extending across it. A man was tied to it by his ankles and wrists much as a pig is tied for roasting. Suddenly there was a great cloud of smoke around the manhole and as I looked I saw that the man had been burned to death. One arm, his head and shreds of clothes remained on the wooden horse. It was hideous and as I looked away I saw two hospital attendants (males) approaching in the opposite direction. As they passed I saw two men lying on the stretcher side by side. I heard someone (I don't know from where) whisper ""They are dead."" It was such a nightmare that I woke up. Interpretation None Answers to questions 2. I was very afraid3.

"The Racist Joke  I'm with my friend Nelson Eastman, Uncle Phil from the television show The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, and others, in a room. Nelson tells true story a bout what I said the previous night when I was drunk. I said it's your kind of joke, referring to the high school boys back home. The joke goes something like, ""What's worse than Robin Givens face?"" or ""How is Robin Spence's face like a ___ ( I forget)?"" The punch line is ""Roman Meal"", which is the whitish colored corn mush. This is a racist joke. I say I don't remember telling the joke, because I don't. I sit in a bathtub feeling very guilty about making a racist joke. The judge looks very sternly at me and asks for my explanation. I don't speak. There is a man with Nelson and I, the judge is now a ways away. The man says that he told the joke, not I! The joke wasn't mine and wasn't told by me. The judge comes over. I say to the man that he needs to tell the judge this or I will. He doesn't tell the judge. I tell the judge. The judge doesn't understand at first.

Even though he is a virgin and doesn't know how to make love himself, his job is to find the ducks and help them have sex so they will have baby ducks. I see many little baby ducks swimming around. He helps the female ducks sit on the male duck in the right position so the deed gets done. I know this because a male narrator voice is telling these facts as I see the picture.

It took a long time to persuade anyone, but at last I convinced them to go with me. However, we decided to go ice-skating instead. I was walking to the pond when I met an old friend, whom I hadn't seen for a few weeks. He was going skating also, but had his boxing gloves instead of ice skates. He tried to excuse himself for not calling me up by saying that he had to go to the doctor for a few days because of a sore hand. When we all reached the pond, we sat in a long row and were asked why the delay. I told the lady in charge that I had forgotten my skates. She thought I was very foolish and everyone was disgusted with me. Interpretation This was a very peculiar dream.

"I went to NTNS. It was a house with hardly any windows on the front. When you walked in the front door there was a very large room. No cash register. No counter. There were a few racks with coats on them. They were having a sale. They were selling consignment coats at 40% off and other coats at 25% off. This made no sense to me so I questioned it two or three times. I asked to clarify because it made no sense to me. I thought this was par for the course with where they were headed with the shop. Then I saw a woman standing there taking cash. She had a little metal cash box. That was when I realized that they had done away with the counter and the cash register in the store. They didn't have many customers. Maybe just one or two at a time. Now I'm sitting on the floor with Jane H and Janet S. There are two pieces of furniture, like a chest of drawers and a bureau in medium dark wood. I said something to them about them working there. They said there really isn't much for them to do anymore so they spend most of their time just sitting there.

"It was sometime in the future, and there had been an atomic war and there weren't many people left. Nothing seemed to be particularly ravaged or wrecked by the war, though there had just been one. The few people who were left were being exterminated by the robots that they had made to do all sorts of things for them. There were a variety of robots. I don't exactly understand why they were killing people off, but they were. I and two other people -- both men -- had apparently just learned about the whole thing, the catastrophe and everything, and we weren't sure about survivors and all. This took place in some large city on the edge of the sea. We went into a building and we found three robots who were immobilized. This often happens with robots and you turn a little switch on and then they come to life. So these being journalism robots, we figured that they would know what was going on and would be able to tell us. So we activated them and then to our very surprise, they jumped on us and tried to kill us. We didn't have any weapons particularly, but we did get away from them. Now it seemed that we knew a little bit more than we did before because we knew we seemed to have to get away from this whole city because the robots were hunting down anybody they could find and were killing them. The only people who there were, were those who were hidden away in a few islands off the shore some miles, at least in this particular country which didn't seem to be American anyhow. We found a motorboat and set out for these islands. People who were especially rich often had private homes on these little islands, most of which were just chunks of rock jutting up from under the water, but some had homes carved out under these rocks and completely hidden. These people who were especially rich also had a sort of matter transmitters that are hooked up between their mansions and these vacation places of theirs so they could just step into this place in their mansion and they would be in their vacation cabins. We go to some of these rich people's houses as we go along looking for a place to go. It seems that perhaps we were being pursued by a couple of these robots which in this case looked more like gorillas or something. But we had one thing in our favor, which was that they couldn't use radar for some reason. This meant they couldn't follow you for very long. I guess actually it was more like radium they couldn't use so they couldn't get a whole bunch of them after a person at once. At any rate, we came to a little island which was just a big black rock jutting out of the water with a little edge right around it, sort of not very much of a ledge, but you could stand on another rock that sort of jutted up behind that. It was dark rock, very dark like lava. We all got off and sort of stood with our backs against this ledge. It seemed to be only a temporary stopping place. While we were standing there, two large sea turtles came in right where we were standing, where there was also a little bit of sand in among the rocks. They started laying eggs there, and this was the point for me to give some sort of zoological lecture about the survival of the fittest or something because we didn't have any food with us, so we were going to gobble up all of these eggs. I can't quite remember whether we stayed on this island or whether we went to another one. At any rate, I think we had first to fight off a couple of these robots which were following us. It seems perhaps we did go to another island which did have one or two houses on it. It seemed to be a fairly deserted island somewhat larger than the others, but with a few trees on it and a wider sandy beach. I went exploring around the island after we had been there a little while and found that it really was quite pleasant as these islands went, because beyond the rock and the beach that we had first been on, there were quite a few trees and a little grassy meadow. The whole island couldn't have been more than four or five acres. I walked down across the meadow and across this marshy place that I had discovered. In actuality we were very close to the city we escaped from to start with because I could see it very clearly. I could see a workman lounging in a doorway. This was a Negro worker and it wasn't a robot and I wondered how it was that the robots let him be around in the city. Then by swimming a little in shallow water and crossing another little island and then swimming again, you could be right at the city. I had this great urge to go over to it, so I did. Then I saw some robots coming, so I swam back and I didn't want them to realize how close our island was or that it was the one to which I was going, so I swam around it and thru this swampy marsh to make them think that I was going past it. As I swam, I was thinking to myself that I was swimming like a shark does, although the picture I had in my mind of it, the shark in the dream, wasn't very shark-like. It was more like a dolphin. It was strange because the water I am swimming thru has all kinds of what I was calling sharks in my dream swimming along close to me. So I swam right into the part of the island where we had started and I got out.",Negative
"I dreamt that I was in a large paneled library--and every wall was covered with books--only the books all had little people on them. There were many people in the room--but I can not remember who any of them were, except one man who I met at a concert in Boston--I have not seen or heard of him since. I recall he had a long broom in his hand, and appeared to be telling the guests who the people on the books were. They were in the majority, my classmates at college. Something he was saying about them was making me mad, and I remember I yelled something at him and he disappeared and suddenly I was alone in the library--I recall trying to leave but there was no door--then I woke up. Interpretation None. Answers to questions 2. I remember that I was very mad at the man (I cannot recall his name, but his face was familiar).3. An actual participant.4. Unpleasant.5. In a large library.6. No.7. I was conscious that all the books were bright colors--but no specific color stands out in my memory.",Negative
"I have a motorcycle. A man asks to ride it. I tell him to be careful. He agrees. We are outside on the lawn of the M City house. He has a wreck and the back wheel is smashed. Then I notice that my cat is hurt. He looks dead. His back legs are smashed. I am worried and sad. Then he revives and crawls to me. I hold him and pet him. He revives some more. I go inside the house. It's been not lived in for awhile; it's in disarray. I ask the guy that lives there if I got any mail or packages. He says, ""No."" I want to show my oil painting to this nice man. I tell him it's a break through, a new art form, an oil painting that moves like T.V. As we look at it, several people change by moving, like (you have pictures drawn here) cartoon figures and flipping pages. The man says, ""I like the old lady one."" I look. I see the young one stiff and diving into the water. He says, ""She's changing into a lob."" Then I see a huge lake. I am looking toward the lovely shore line, trees, rugged, like Alaska. I see her laying unconscious in the bottom of the row boat, dying of lack of water, thirst in a lake of water! The man finds a tube with water in it and brings it to her because he wants the row boat.",Negative
"I'm in charge of designing a book cover, poster or document - not clear which. I'm either hired by a client, or I'm a student responding to a brief. My client/tutor is an older woman. She suggests I find the actual handwriting of a particular author. The author is a children's fantasy writer like C.S.Lewis or someone like that. I'm told I'll be able to find his handwriting on the internet. I search for a long time and don't find what I'm looking for. Later I realize the authors handwriting I'm looking for is in fact Charles Darwin of which there are lots of examples. Suddenly I'm in the role of tutor and I have a student. She is shy and likes the Smiths (band) I'm explaining to her about the beauty of handwritten type, especially Darwin's fount pen letter-forms.",Negative
"A Friendly Jock Reunion  I walk into a building where baseball is being played. It seems to be a practice because there is a batting cage around the batter. There are, however, teams there, and people timing pitch speed and selling concessions. I see my high school teammates Simon Naver and Binky Ahmed, who are participating in the game in some way. Binky may have the radar gun. I shake their hands and we talk. I haven't seen them in a while. My old coach Shooter Jackson is there. I see him and we talk. His face is covered in bits of toilet tissue: he has really cut himself badly when shaving. Then the bits of tissue are gone. I ask him how this year's team is doing. He says pretty shitty. I ask if they are young, and he says yes, telling me about several sophomores and juniors.",Negative

"I am in my apartment in the Bronx, sleeping. I hear noise in the foyer. Two dolls, hanging from a doorknob, have come to life. I speak to the male doll and the female doll and feel happy. I have made two friends. Then we are outside in a country at war. The terrain is hilly and partially wooded. Helicopters appear and fire rockets, which explode in a suppressed manner. There is no full and dense explosion. Instead, on impact the force of the blast shoots out to the left and right. This happens several times. We begin running. A fighter plane appears overhead. I expect it to strafe us. Unexpectedly, it pulls up from a power dive and on the upswing drops a cloud of white powder or gas, which we run from. We are spotted or captured by police.

I notice a fish and air bubbles and think I've landed in an ocean and am swimming. Then I'm alone in the air again. Then I hear an airplane and realize I could crash into them. One comes through a brown, thick cloud wall and I narrowly escape a collision. I then dive for earth and land. I see Fox and he's coming to me with a girl and I realize that girl is me, in a younger time. Her hair is brown, mine is blonde. Fox can see me, but she can't. The three of us shower together. I wash her back and Fox says, ""Easy. Don't hurt her."" I guess I was a bit jealous. I lovingly wash his back.",Positive
"I was dating Sam from Big Brother. We owned some kind of company/factory thing. It was a weird house building thing, with lots of windows around the outside. It was quite messy. He'd had shaggy hair and had a haircut so it was tidier and shorter, but I preferred his old haircut.",Positive

"I am a young man with shoulder length hair like Mark (or Jesus). A beautiful woman is attracted to me. I am to her. We are scientists that work with animals. Suddenly she turns into a crazed creature that kills and maims. She must touch your hands and then rips you up, your blood rushing out all over. The man sees her do that to some research animals and runs to tell the others. All the blue uniformed (overalls like mechanics) gather together and she comes in, sweet and interesting, a siren hard to resist. He almost lets her touch him, but the others rush around him and they all hold hands. She blacks out and comes to seeming normal. She asks, ""Did I black out?"" They all nervously watch her and try to appear nonchalant. She says, ""I need to do the weight drop."" They all go with her. It is a machine that runs straight up 200 ft. and then smashes toward the ground very fast. She is very adventurous and loves it as fast as it will go. The men love it too and are nearly swooning. One man says, ""Wow! That's even better than sex."" They admire her. Then they run to another room and hold hands. She comes in, cajoling, needing to connect and hold hands. A woman runs in screaming, ""She got to all the animals. You should see them. It's horrible."" I see and hear blood spurting out of their bodies. It's sickening. She grabs the last hand of the serpentine and one of her hands is free. The crazy woman comes toward her. The woman at the end of the line wants to give in to her. I (now a woman) scream, ""No, NO! Don't let her touch you."" I manage to penetrate the spell the monster woman has created, so she goes up to a woman named Doris, in the middle of the serpentine. She nearly lures Doris into letting her join the line. I scream over and over, ""Doris, Doris, don't let her. Concentrate."" I break the spell again. The monster woman goes from the end woman to Doris over and over again, almost making it each time. I am exhausted, but must fight on.",Negative

"The Persistent Drunk  I'm outside Carter School near the south sidewalk by the gymnasium doors at a table with a 750mL bottle of beer. Another man is with me. He may leave. I look for a sytrofoam cup. Inside the gymnasium two acquaintances of mine, Toly and Mads, are playing guitar in a concert-like occasion. There is a party occurring inside. A security guard is near the gymnasium door, and the door to the outside. He's dressed in a blue police uniform with a funky, feathered hat, and has small, official writing on his uniform. I'm sitting at a table with others facing the sliding gymnasium door. A man brings some brownies with marijuana baked into them. They look like rice crispy bars. They are a darker shade, and have a chunk of chocolate or marshmallow on top. He has four of these brownies left. I ask him for one, entreating him half sarcastically and have seriously to let me have one. He seems to intend to eat all four himself. A strange drunk man approaches us from my right. He wants a brownie. We say that the brownies are not good for him, because he doesn't know they have marijuana in. He is persistent and asks why, in his drunkenness. I say to the drunk, ""See these two guys here?"", pointing to my friends Stephen Ramos and Kevin Simpson, who are on my left side. ""They're my friends. It's their party. So get the fuck out."" The drunk is out of control and isn't respecting other people's space. We fight. I pick him up by his face with both of my hands, as my fingers grip his skull and the inside of his mouth. He drools and spits a lot. I get saliva on me. I carry him outside. He is really intoxicated. I throw him out, despite his persistence. It's a long struggle. He takes quite a beating, but he stays out. I scoop up a couple handfuls of slushy snow off the steps and rub it on my face to wash off his saliva. I walk back inside to a group of people who know I've just thrown this man out. My acquaintance Nicolas, another man, and two friends that I know from Norway whom are wearing large puffy bright yellow jackets are there. Kevin and Stephen cheer me for kicking the stranger out and beating him up. My friend Ellen Sanders is there. I give her a big friendly joking shove.",Negative

The names I was considering now were Lindsay (Freaks and Geeks), Kaylee (Firefly) or River (Firefly). I decided to go with Ezra for a bit. He was driving. He stopped at a house and they took him the rest of the way. I ended up at a friend of Mom's. I called her to get me. The clock said 12 PM but that was wrong.

"Mom dropped me off at the train station. I had gotten a letter from the school saying that I had photos to pick from last year. I told Mom to try and get them. It was inside a building. I hadn't been to this part of it before. I went down an escalator. This lady gave me a plastic folder and it had the photos in it. There was one of me, Calvin and others, but my hair was all in my face. I quickly flicked through to see if there were any of Eugene, but I didn't find any. I put it in my bag and jumped onto a train. It was two storeys. I climbed up and this guy was standing over two seats and he had no underpants on (just a shirt) and his balls were showing. There were lots of retards on the train. I asked the driver what the next stop was and she said ""Peleigh"" (I think. It started with P or B, and ended in 'eigh' -- prounced 'ee'). I looked on the map thing and the stop was miles away and it wasn't stopping at any stops in between. I called Mom to tell her. I asked if I should jump off and she said ""Nah"" but I jumped up as she said it. I forgot to grab my water though and it was now dark. It was a long walk back and Mom wouldn't get me. I started walking down a path on the street. There was a car parked in a driveway and some dodgy guys were sitting in it. This little thing started running towards me and it was a cute, fluffy little dog. It barked. I followed the train tracks and ended up at a restaurant which it went through (or past?). It was very big and fancy and I walked in at the bottom floor, but it also had an upstairs area. There was a parrot which would say ""Charlie, can I take your order!"" and some other variants. This was some in-joke which the patrons understood. I walked through and was chewing bubblegum. I was on the phone to Mom and went outside. I had a wobbly tooth. The gum got stuck on it, so I tried to pull it off with my fingers and my tooth came out. I said to Mom ""My tooth fell out!"". I said it must've been a baby tooth. I was walking on a wall and saw Spaceman on a roof, or something. I then realized it actually was Spaceman and saw ""It is Spaceman!"". There was a long drop between me and him, and so I just kept walking. I got down to walk around back to the tracks. There were lots of other obstacles. One was like a white water rafting thing, but as a slide. There were two sets of tracks going down it. I had to climb up, fighting the water and watching out for trains. So I walked around again (to walk around made it take a lot longer). I went to a chemist and bought something. Then I was watching a movie, I think. This girl was in the water, upside down. A shark was just beneath her, and presumably, thought something was wrong. She stayed still and then it started raining and the shark left. I think, eventually, I got back to civilization. I was looking through the photos and saw photos of Valerie and Ariana at my graduation. I didn't remember them being there and then I realized that ""they were there for Farrah!"". Dad asked which chemist I had gone to. I checked the bag and it said ""Auto Express"". There was also something before with Ezra.",Negative
"I was in a store such as a Burrows store and purchased four new bright blue desk tops. They were about 18 inches wide, 30 inches long and made of a thin plywood-like material. They had a piece attached on the back with a slab in it for their attachment to a stand, something like a music stand. I took them to class and gave three of them to other pupils, keeping one for myself. the teacher was a woman, 28, and is not only one of my instructors here at Reserve, but is also the young lady I have been dating quite a bit lately and am very fond of. For some reason or other I soon painted my desk top a duller color, pinkish brown. The teacher seemed to be quite pleased with the desks and so was I.

First id did not stray far--different levels of the tree house--but then it got into the swimming pool ???.

My husband had fled to Canada, where he had worked hard to find a job -- selling extra heavy sheets to Canadians -- and to buy a life insurance policy for 10,001 dollars so he would provide for me if anything happened. He had also managed to find a room right over our home, where he could hear the sounds of his son learning to talk (naturally Canada is up).

"My cousin Claire had a party in a large space which was reminiscent of my place of work, but more comfortable, more futuristic. Before the party, she was engaged in choosing a present for herself. She settled on a large sound-sensitive plant, that sat in a container on the back wall. The plant was more like a creature. It was a bit like a giant squid with long pale grey tentacles (or tendrils) that extended apparently indefinitely and grew almost instantaneously to touch any person if they made and verbal noise. It was very frightening to be around it. People began turning up to the party and admiring this thing, passing compliments to Claire. my friend Trisha was there along with lots of friends I used to go to school with, and people from the past. The party went on late. I got drunk. The plant thing kept going for me. Later on my friend Tim turned up and his company made the evening less sinister - avoiding the plant thing became very funny. Even later still I found myself alone with Trisha. There was sexual attraction, but I can't remember if anything happened physically.",Positive
"Super Power Engines  I'm on a plane that is crashing, it is going down. It seems to spiral downwards. We get close to the ground and one or both engines fire explosively, blasting the plane up and averting the crash. The firepower of the engines at this point is unfathomable. The plane was crashing, and the boost from the engines was immense, like a rocket, and the plane blasted up into the sky. The plane may fly in spirals, because only one engine may fire. The plane crashes in a lake. It seems to crash relatively softly and horizontally. Many people, including myself, survive. Some people die. I'm on shore with survivors, and I tell some people to go gather up the dead bodies, which are in the lake. Others and I go with a man who informs us of a new type of power that was used in our plane, experimentally. I am surprised by the use of this new power, and want to learn more about it. The new power was being tested on that plane. I was very impressed by the power of the engines to avert the crash, initially.",Negative

"I'm at a LT - not sure if I'm in it or on team, it might be a focus course or not, but it's being held outside in a nice place with trees. The trainees are all on folding chairs. I'm going for a bathroom break, and 2 or 3 other girls follow me. The bathroom is in a rickety little building next to this open space where the trainees are, and the whole place seems to be fairly old, dates at least from the 40's, very country, may be (or have been) a farm, that sort of construction and fixtures. As I go into the bathroom, the others are not far behind, and I'm figuring we'll all come in together though I'm not keen on that, and as I step in I push the door to behind me, a bit harder than I planned on, because it almost shuts, and they stop outside, presumably because they think I want to be alone. I feel uncomfortable about that - I don't want to shut anybody out. Actually, I'm not alone anyway. Bill Cosby is in here, and he's being very talkative, telling me about his family, asking how mine is and how I am, all while I'm sitting on the toilet. It's in a partial stall without a door, so he can see me, and I keep my skirt (the big ivory one) pulled down around me. This is rather awkward, too, but it doesn't seem to bother him - actually he takes no notice and just goes right on talking. I have my pee, but that problem starts again, where I can't quite get finished - as soon as I think I've stopped, the urge comes back and I can't get up till a few more drops come out and then it starts over.

"FD was short-handed. They called and asked me to come in and help for just one night. I agreed. I was surprised at what I found. The place was a mess. I went back to the grill. There was as bun and a hamburger on the grill. not cooking but maybe being kept warm. There were also a bunch of candy wrappers in a section attached to the grill. like the drip pan. The one I remember was an M&M; wrapper. I told someone working there that you should always but two meat patties on a sandwich because it will taste much better and people will pay extra for it. I was making someone a fish sandwich so I put two pieces of fish on it. I went to look at the work schedule to see who was coming in that night. It said, Cutler. It was typed in bold black letters. He had been scheduled the previous night also. I thought it was good that he was scheduled because he's a good kid and good worker. For some reason I realized I would have to clean up the kitchen at close. That's a hard and messy job. When it was close to closing time, I took a metal piece off the ice cream syrup to wash it. I got extra syrup on it taking it out. It strung out like melted cheese. The syrup was chocolate and butterscotch. It was good.",Negative
I was on a Euclid Avenue streetcar about 9 o'clock on a Wednesday morning. Suddenly a girl in one of my classes came up and sat down next to me. We talked about school and then she had to get off at Abington to go to Clark Library.

I don't know how it got in here, I suppose it flew in by accident when somebody had the door open. Well, I expect it wants out - I'll go hold the front door open and maybe it'll see. I don't want to startle it, it might just fly around the house and never get out - you know how these things can be. It does move closer to the door (I was a room away a minute ago), and I step very carefully, quietly past it. Now at the door, I see that somebody else is here. [This is no longer clear, but it's definitely one animal that lives here and one that doesn't - I could presume one of my cats, but I'm not sure. And the other is not a cat, for sure, but not necessarily any particular other animal - it has characteristics of a lamb, but I think it's a combination of animals. Basically it's small, cute, and innocent-looking.] I'm concerned that they'll get out if I just leave the door open for the bird - a pretty silly situation.",Negative
"My dream was really a surprise because I never thought it could relate to a person who I secretly hate and dislike. The motive for my resentment is that he offended my closest relative, not just by speaking against him, but also going against his own family. This all stems from an old partnership which he had with my relative, who was a victim of fraud and this is the cause of the resentment. Besides, he is approximately 70 years old. This relates to my dream in the following way: My relative and I were in the same place where my relative used to work (in Ica). His job was related to the sale of carbonated drinks. Suddenly that person appeared with his son -- 35 years old -- and when we saw them, we felt some sort of disgust. Therefore, we decided to get out of that place and we parked by the sidewalk in order to leave later on. That's all. Parenthetically, it must be said that my relative has been called by the carbonated drink concern to take care of the administration of it in Ica. This rectifies the tremendous injustice done to him by the above-mentioned person.",Negative
"I work for an old man who is rich. He keeps a rigid schedule so when we aren't on duty upstairs we go downstairs and live our own life. I am surprised how free and fun people are downstairs and wonder how they dare because if the old man found out he'd be angry and fire them. There is a dance. I am dancing near an open door to the outside. I think what would really happen if I escaped. I know he's said there are terrible things out there. On an impulse, I suddenly run outside. People are shocked and concerned. I'm a little scared. Nothing happens. I imagine a snaky tentacle touches my ankle. I run back into the house. Then I see a giant building loom up over the wall and look in. It's the monster. I think, ""How can a building hurt me?"" I leave again. I get into a car and think, ""I'd better take another street out of here."" I look to my left and see smoke from a big fire. Then I remember that my parents and Judy are still in the building. I can't leave them. A courthouse building slides out toward the street to get me. I feel threatened, but go in anyway. I drive up fast and see Judy rush from work. They are escaping in another car. I drive up to them and they are so scared they don't know it's me. We drive in a circle, me chasing them running. I yell, ""Look, it's me."" Finally she recognizes me. I ask where my parents are. They are in the back seat.",Negative
"I had just returned from a trip and had accumulated a lot of mail.  My box was up high, on top of some others, and someone else had to climb up and check it for me. There was quite a bit of mail, and 8 or 10 pieces were from Ron Nadner-notes indicating he still couldn't tell me his new address.  Each one was the same, simply saying, :Still don't know.""  Another letter had been opened.  It was from Brenda Trask, and the person giving me the mail said it was the saddest letter he had ever read-but that the good news in it might balance out the bad.  I never did read it.",Positive

Kellogg, his face flushed in characteristic manner, is squatting on his haunches partly behind the stairway.

"I was on an exchange in the UK or US. I was hanging out with some people, including Calvin and Tiana. A bunch of us went to this place to vote for stuff. We got poster for what we voted for and waited outside. A plane was going to fly above saying what got accepted. All the things we voted for were accepted. Calvin, Tiana and I went to this cafe place. He ordered a vanilla and chocolate thickshake. My water bottle was almost empty. I sat with Tiana who was upset and he brought the drinks. I was then at home, but it was the old house. I was watching Entourage and Vince had a Swedish girlfriend called ""Kiri"" and he was lying in bed and she was going down on him. She was going fast and it was very graphic. He told her to stop and she said ""it looks so real"". I thought she meant his genitals, but then she said 'who is it?' and I think she was referring to an affair he was having. Dad commented on it later. Eric had a tumour or something and Sloane was upset/angry with him. He was driving and helped some family get to and from hospital. He pulled out on a busy road and a car nipped him. He continued driving and a huge pile-up started happening. There were flashes as he drove towards it. Then it showed him in hospital and his face and ears were messed up. I wondered if that was the end of the show.",Negative

The 'cool' guy was drawing on the TV. Calvin left and took a skateboard.

"Yesterday when I was at school, they were working on the alarm system and it kept going off and going off and going off all during second and third periods. So I guess it was reflected in my dream last night. I dreamt that I was in sixth period in Mr. Terew's (sp?) class in the main building and that someone had taken one of the alarm boxes off the wall and was holding it in their hand, and this woman grabs me by the hand and says, ""Come on, let's get out of here. It's going to sound any minute now."" And so we got out, we were running down the stairs as fast as we could run, and all of a sudden I was hanging in mid-air and I couldn't run anywhere.

The stores were very big and we got to one in which they sold toys on every floor. There were very pretty toys, there were toys everywhere and I didn't find any of the things I wanted to buy. Later I was at a Spanish restaurant eating with my whole family, including my boyfriend, and then a dancer came out and started to dance on top of a table, just in front of my boyfriend. It was horrible for me. There was nothing I could do to make her leave.",Positive

I'm walking down the street, about to turn a corner, and I'm confronted by a loud man in a raincoat - he's really mad about something but I don't know what. He just stands and yells at me, sometimes shoving with his elbow and shoulder - he's got his hands stuck in his pockets. I retreat up the street a bit - there are some people out watching. I guess they think I had something to do with this guy. He follows and keeps yelling at me - some of the time he yells around in general but it's mostly at me - I don't know him and definitely didn't do anything to start this, it seems he's just picked me because I'm handy.

We heard someone talking and Mom too. They mentioned us and I tried to hide behind a huge red capsicum. They caught us and accused us of snooping and I denied it and said we came to look at the plant. I had a little puppy and he got put in the microwave with Amelia's milk. He got too hot and I quickly got him out. Granma joked about Amelia being cute and me being ugly.,Positive

"I dreamt I had a date with my ex-husband. Before the movie we met at a drugstore lunch counter and had bacon, lettuce, tomato sandwiches. While we were sitting there, he started a quarrel about something I can't remember but I know it was petty. Then he walked out. So I bought a box of popcorn and went to the movie alone. It was a downtown theater and an usher seated me as if the seats were reserved. The movie ""Hansel and Gretal"" was playing. At the back of the show were tables, as if it were a first-class restaurant, so I went back there to sit with my younger sister (20) and my older married sister (26). The waiter helped me off with my coat and I sat with them but we didn't order anything to eat. I remember that it was snowing and slushy outside and we all wore boots.

I was walking up a highway going uphill. Just ahead of me I saw the father (age 50) of a childhood playmate of mine. He had a tank strapped to his back. From the tank ran a hose to the bottom part of a broom which he was sweeping the highway with. The water from the tank would come out of the hose just at the bristle of the broom so as he swept he also washed the highway. I took the contraption and started sweeping the highway. I couldn't understand why the highway could be dirty since it had rained two nights previously. Then I remembered that it had snowed the night previously.

"I'm at work [which isn't the library, at least as I know it] and I'm making records on some kind of imprinting machine - it makes plastic labels like a label gun does. I ask my supervisor what to call it, and (he/she?) says something incoherent and goes off. This has been happening lately, and it's getting worse. (He/she?) is a trifle hostile with it, and I'm wondering - along with the other people here - how it's going to end. (He/she?) is going off (his/her?) rocker, and yet is still the boss here. Mostly we're ignoring it and getting the job done anyway, but it can't go on forever. I'm on a roof or ledge, with a rail around it, not a very big place, just concrete, next to probably an apartment house. There are several other girls here with me, people I work with I think, and we're just talking. Across the street is a foreign-car garage - it doesn't look like one, of course, it's a small but architecturally interesting (stucco?) building with 2 sections, looking rather like cylinders. We know what it is because we know MT runs it - it's new, he just got set up and this is a pretty mature and positive thing to do. Also pretty classy, because he's working on fancy cars for fancy people. There isn't much room on this ledge and the rail isn't very high, but I lean out over it for a better look at this garage while we're talking. MT himself comes and joins us. He doesn't look like he used to. He's shaved his beard and his hair is a different style and he looks pensive and a little sad. [Actually, of course, it's not even MT's face, beard or no beard - it's still a small regular face with dark hair and eyes - also no glasses! - but it's a handsomer face with softer features.] I'm sitting on a concrete ledge on the street next to a vendor of pastries - this is a downtown area, very bustling, cosmopolitan - open-air bistros and vendors, pedestrians. MT is sitting on my right and a couple I know rather better are sitting on my left. We're all three chatting away, but MT is sort of detached and pensive. It starts to rain, pretty hard too, and I have an umbrella which after a moment's fumbling I get up and put over both of us. Me and MT, that is, and he seems a little surprised. The other couple get up and leave (I think to get out of the rain), but we stay and the rain slacks off. I talk to the pastry man a bit and he shows me his wares. It's a bit awkward with MT, we're both being kind of shy. I thought it was odd that the umbrella turned out to be big enough for both of us easily, but we don't have to squeeze up against each other. I find him only mildly attractive because of his looks and his shyness, but I'm sure the reticence goes much deeper and I don't like that. I'm sure I don't want to get involved with him.",Negative
"It was in an auditorium. The seats were hard, old-fashioned ones of wood, not padded seats, but they curved a little bit. There was a big aisle down the middle.

I was sitting there and thinking what I was going to say. Then he called my name, so I got up and handed my notes to Pat, and she said, ""Do you want me to go up the aisle with you?"" And I said, ""No, I am going to go up myself."" And I went down the aisle in a fast, determined pace and while I was going, the instructor said, ""You know, Miss Green, it's surprising that you are as good as you are because I had a woman in this class a year ago who..."" and I didn't give him a chance to finish.

"I'm a patient in a hospital. I have a very large private room, large compared to waking life hospital private rooms. The door is on the wall facing the end of my bed slightly to my left. There is a large distance between the end of my bed and the door. I had either been asleep or I was just on the verge of falling asleep. A black man enters my room and heads straight towards me with the intention of harming me in some way. Just as he reaches the end of my bed, someone else enters the room and physically tackles him to the floor. Once these two people are out of my room I get out of my bed and go across the hall into another much larger room that has several beds in it. All of the bids had patients in them. I asked a nurse if I could sleep with one of the patients in that room that night. She was hesitant. But I pointed out that in one of the beds there is a very large poodle, dog, sleeping rather than a patient. There are several smaller dogs, I think they're puppies, also sleeping in that bed. The puppies aren't poodles. I tell her that that is the bed that I went to sleep in, so she agrees. I get in the bed and I am practically lying on top of the poodle. I am now a dog. I am telepathically communicating with this poodle. The poodle is not the mother of the puppies, yet she is nursing them. My initial communication with the poodle is about why I am there, why I wanted to sleep there. It feels safer or comforting. I don't know if I am communicating this to the poodle or if I am just thinking about how it feels to be laying there next to this big soft fluffy poodle. She is lying on her side with her paws stretched out to the side. She's very hungry. She never moves. Yet somehow she eats. As she does there is a liquid substance that comes out of her mouth. It is mostly clear but has white spots. This is an indication that something is wrong with her. I don't know if I actually say something to the nurse about this or if I'm just thinking about saying something to the nurse. This would indicate to me that I am now human. I'm having a conversation with this nurse about the 12 finalists from the last season of American Idol who were coming in to entertain patients at the hospital.

"I was in a long, rather elaborate corridor which was brilliantly lighted by crystal chandeliers. There was a punch table around which many people were gathered, and groups were standing and walking around, giving an impression of constant activity. This was, I knew, a fraternity social affair. My date, however, seemed constantly to run off, returning later but giving me an uneasy feeling of being left alone. One of his quick trips back to me, he asked ""how's O.?"" and I felt surprised that he should know O.  I met a girl who was also alone, and the two of us went back to an elaborate lounge. After some muddled activity, I was back in the living room of my own home, and the mother of a friend (boy) of mine was asking me to give her a wide silver filigree bracelet that I own. Interpretation In retrospect this dream seems to be confusingly active; the activity, that is, of people constantly milling around. The corridor-like setting seemed very large, but because of the many people, was not vast.  My date, I presumed in the dream, was gotten for me by a friend of mine who is actually in the fraternity, and whose mother it was who later asked me for the bracelet. I do not know how I know it was his mother in the dream, for I have met her but once, and would not recognize her if I saw her again, I am sure. My surprise at being asked ""how O. was"" springs from the fact that I did not know that my date was not gotten for me by my fraternity friend, but my date was instead a friend of O. O., incidentally, is my ""unrequited."" Answers to questions 2. Passivity except for surprise where indicated in the dream report2. Participant4. Neither5. Given in dream (corridor; living room)6. No7. Not colors, but brilliant light from crystal chandeliers.",Negative
"In the following dream I was lying on my bed in my own bedroom and at the time I was dreaming I was not sure whether I was awake or asleep. I lay on my bed for a while and then heard someone coming up the stairs to my room. I tried to call out and ask who it was but was unable to speak. The footsteps slowly came closer and at last entered my bedroom. I saw the person, evidently a man, and was overcome with fear. I tried to get up to get to my gun rack which is just outside my bedroom door, but I was unable to move. Finally, just before I awoke, I was released from the spell and dashed to my gunrack. I took out a rifle and turned to face the unknown visitor, only to find that it was a small boy who was greatly concerned over my apparent desire to harm him. I felt rather foolish at becoming so terrified at the presence of such a small child and then woke up.",Negative

"My brother Dwight is dressed up in a nice suit and has received a guitar and a banjo for his birthday. He sits for a moment in a manual wheelchair that is in the room. I comment to him that my father was pleased that he's enjoying his birthday gifts. Dwight asks how I know, since my father didn't say anything. I said, ""It was in his face, his expression. I could tell he knew you loved sitting in the wheelchair."" Dwight says, ""All I did was sit."" I say, ""I know, but I could tell Dad could tell you loved the gift."" Then, as Dwight is making a chair out of the cardboard boxes, the gifts came in by folding them on the perforated lines, I say, ""You know, I had a guitar, a mandolin, a fiddle and a banjo."" Dwight says, ""Really?"" I say, ""Yes, but I sold some of them."" He asks, ""Why did you?"" I say, ""I was poor. I needed the money. I was a student then and on SSI"" (Dwight says the SSI word with me like he's heard this story many times). I only got $1450 a month and I had to save $100 a month for the kids, for child support.

However, I wouldn't do it because the friend of mine wanted poached eggs. When I had finished, however, the eggs seemed to be as hard as a rock and not soft like poached eggs usually are. Interpretation No one I know is sick in the hospital now and I don't ever remember having been asked to fix poached eggs for a ""sick friend in the hospital."" Answers to questions 2.

In this dream my wife and I were driving along a country road when I decided to turn the car around for some unknown reason. It so happened I ran the two front wheels into a ditch.

I was driving through my mother's hometown. I had a young girl with me. I think she was African American. We came home and we were getting ready for bed. She ran into this bedroom a couple of times to this old woman to say goodnight. Where we were sleeping was surrounded by bookshelves. Some of the bookshelves formed like a square with just a little entryway. I was sleeping inside there and she was sleeping on the other side of one of the bookshelves. I gave her my blue sleeping bag and told her she could use it either as a sleeping bag or a comforter. She had hoped she would get to sleep on a bed and I told her no. I told her to go into the other bedroom and get a pillow off the bed to use. She brought those out and then she went into the older woman's bedroom again to say goodnight one more time.

I get four little packages. I pay for the sandwiches, not for the things in the packages. Somehow I manage to go through the register without paying. This may be due to a mistake of an employee which I took advantage of. I steal the packages. I go the bathroom and rip up the UPC codes of the packages so the theft sensor won't pick them up as I leave the store, and the alarm won't sound. My classmate from Brimson named Donovan comes out of a stall in the bathroom. I put all my things in a plastic bag. There are many other bags in the bag, and some envelopes. I go out of the store.

We are driving in the country. We come to the end of one road and we have to turn left or right. The driver confirms that we want to turn left and I say yes. The driver also says something about the road being 35. I see the road sign and confirm that it is 35. Now we are at the site and it seems more like a public place, maybe a university.

"I was at this house in the middle of nowhere. I was with Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki and going out with the former. Mom came up and left with him. When they left, Jared put his arm around me and we started making out. This black guy was a friend of his and was cleaning something outside and he knew about this affair we were having. I wanted to leave and called Mom but she only just got back and said it would take ""70 minutes"" for her to get back. I started locking all the doors and windows. None were locked because there wasn't anyone around for miles. There were stingy looking frilly curtains on the windows.

We ran through this crowded undercover place and everyone was shooting. I shot the bad guy but then my gun clicked as it had run out of bullets and he lifted his gun to shoot me, but this girl, who was an ex-girlfriend of his, grabbed him and shot him herself.

The lights were turned off in the store for the beetles, which didn't like strong light, and people were given flashlights to look at them walking up boxes. (product boxes) I was with Elena. African tribes were bathing in the canal. Some sort of religious ritual. Elena said, ""You sure have gotten fat."" And I said, ""After I got off the meth I gained some weight."" She said, well, that's good and bad. We had to get the N train shuttle which went from Queens, and a car had dropped Harper off to soon, because she said 9th Avenue was OK, and the car dropped her off at 9th Avenue in Queens. She was complaining. I walked down a shortcut from Ave B, through a construction site, to Avenue A, only to walk right into a new store/studio space that was full of artists. One side of the room had a table with tons of boxes of Dunkin Donuts stacked on it. A girl I didn't know named Colleen was having the party, and was glad I was there. The people's art was terrible, but they thought they were good artists. I didn't show mine because I didn't respect their work.

She was at least as tall as me, and wearing a uniform of some kind, with a dark skirt and white blouse.  She said she worked for some kind of karate club or something.

I thought it would be fun to go back and visit with him a bit, but by that time we had gone several blocks and were in between two stops that were quite some distance apart.  When we got to the next stop, it turned out to be the end of the line.  I couldn't decide whether to say on the bus and ride it back, which would mean a wait before we got started, or to get off and walk back, which would also take some time-or whether to take another bus or a cab, which would mean paying an extra fare, with no assurance as to when one would come along.",Negative

He drove on this wobbly road really fast and I was worried we would go over the edge. We ended up in Washington DC. The house thing was near a fair and a restaurant. This lady and her kids were at the fair and I said something to the kid and the mother chucked a spaz. Ted paused or did something weird to the time and I bashed her.

I was sitting at a table and some girl asked if I wanted to go to some back room. I said no, but Ted went. I left the table and saw Johnny Knoxville coming out of a cinema. I asked him for a photo and he said ""It's not important"" and went to rest somewhere. He was going to the back room, so I went in there first. It was all seats, like a cinema.

"I've come to see Trisha but she's not home - I either need to pick something up or leave something. She's living in this smashing house that's not in a residential area but, as if you were in a small town with a small downtown area, like it was near the middle of that, next to like doctors' offices and that. The house is modern, maybe with stone walls or something, very high ceilings, lots of plants hanging and standing, open spaces broken up by dividers. I let myself in to do what I came for and I also need to pee. The toilet is not in its own room but in the bedroom area, and it has an extra lever - I don't know what it's for, but I pull it just to see, thinking it might have a bidet function or something. What it does is let down this fine mist from above, right in front of you as you sit on the toilet. It's very nice but I still don't know what it's meant to accomplish. There's a cat here, too, a nice gray striped one, who comes up to visit. While I'm still sitting, Trisha comes home. I wonder if she'll be okay with me coming like this, but she doesn't mind. (She actually came in very quietly and I was startled when she appeared suddenly.) Her hair is different - she's let the tail loose and maybe gotten a permanent, it's falling to her shoulders, fluffier and curlier - very pretty - I hadn't realized that so much of her hair was braided into the tail. Also while I'm here, Lynnette comes in - we've seen her park her car and come to the house through the big plate glass windows. Trisha tells me she's changed her name. [Can't remember to what.] She just got tired of the old one.",Negative
"I was in the army, and was being transferred to a new duty station or going off active duty.  They had shipped me some things I had left behind, and I picked them up at some kind of express office.  My car's ""boot"" bag, for example, but it contained only a few baseball bats, no boot.  Also a box or sack containing several large hunks of cheese, some of which were quite soft and moist, but all of which were moldy.  After some indecision, I threw all of them away.",Positive

"I was getting radiation done for some reason, and I was so afraid that it wasn't going to enough, I mean, that it was going to be too much. And the radiation would come from a laser beam from the CD player, and the CD would spin around, and when the CD would be a certain point, they would complete the circuit and the radiation would happen. And next thing I knew I was going to a party at headquarters with Terri. Mrs. Dougherty was at the reception desk. In the back of the, when you get into the party it was like a store, and I was looking at all these different things -- stuffed animals and tree-top angels and things, things and then I started thinking about Brittany's reindeer and I woke up.",Negative
"I was walking down an alley when I came to a corner onto a big street. On the corner inside a big door a girl and boy were making a mattress. The girl hated me but the boy was my friend and he came out to talk with me. Then he held a model helicopter above his head and started to fly, so I followed him. Then we sat on a ridge coming out of a building. He said he could fly like me now but not without the helicopter. All of a sudden the ridge we were on broke, and we fell. Then further down the street I saw a lady in a business suit coming towards us. I started to run, but she was able to catch me. I tried to get away by flying but she was holding onto me so tight I could hardly get off the ground. Then she took me to a store that reminded me of Korea. Then she said I could have anything I wanted but I refused. Then the people from the north came by and got me away from the lady and took me skiing in some odd apparel. Setting: Felt like New York City. Characters: The boy, the girl, the lady in the suit, the family from the north. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. Happy that the boy could fly. Scared of the lady. I felt like the family from the north was weird.",Negative
"I was doing SAID work at the computer for an event other than conference. I went to a store to do some shopping. I was looking for candleholders in the right shade of purple that would match something someone else was doing for the event. I happened to see that person at the store so I picked up a purple candleholder and took it over to her to get her opinion as to how good of a match it was. She wasn't sure. There were large and long rectangular pieces of fabric hanging from the ceiling. They were a rainbow of colors, including two shades of purple hanging next to each other. I pointed to them and asked her if she could tell if one of those was the right shade. She said the lighter one, which was lavender. I didn't think that was right but said okay and went and got two lavender candleholders. The first two that I had picked up were about four or six inches in diameter and about three inches deep. The lavender ones were square with slightly rounded corners. They were about 2 inch square. Even though I didn't think they were the right color, based on what I remembered seeing, I picked up two of them. I was walking through the store to look for some other things and I saw the other woman again talking to someone. I waited until she was free and then walked up to her and told her I just wanted to make sure I had the right shade.",Negative
"I was at home but it was different. Mom had bought heaps of these thick red socks. Leslie and Valerie had taken a few.

She pulled up on a motorbike and Mom turned off the outside light. She came to the door and Mom refused her money and she said ""of course not"" and left. She was actually super crazy. Later I was staying at Dad's. I watched some Alain Delon movie from the 1980s and he was old. It was a weird horror film. We fell asleep and I woke up to the video player opening and I looked up and saw someone outside wearing ""superhero clothes"" and then ran off. I saw the door unlocked and open. Dad locked it and shut the curtains. Later, Mom and Ezra were there too. This bench top had a weird texture and she wanted it. She sent us a video.",Negative

They were just sort of like spread out. There were some other people running cash registers. I went in and just sort of said hello. Everybody was buying candy, Halloween candy, so apparently it must have been close to Halloween. I said a few things to my brother and then my mother asked me what Dave and I were doing. Dave's another brother. I replied something to the effect that we're spending all our time missing you or something, something like this. This was about, this was the full content of the dream.

Partway through I bent down and looked at the Eye.  At the end, I talked to my junior/senior year high school English teacher Ms. Kraft.  I told her about how some of the English classes I'd taken in college allowed more expansion and covering more than the limitations I got from her class, but tried to word it nicely.

"I dreamed that I was trying to swim in a huge swimming pool that had no water. The fact that there wasn't any water in the pool did not hinder my activity. The pool was built at a 45 degree angle. I was swimming downward instead of upward. My actions were deliberate and I did not feel any anxiety while I was swimming. I remember very clearly that I was swimming downward and that I was slightly confused about the thought that I had to get back up to the top of the pool. There was a very short interval of the dream that I do not remember, but I do know that in some way or another I did get back to the top of the pool and I started to swim down again. (I did this twice.) Interpretation I am not a good swimmer but I do go swimming now and then to try to improve my strokes, etc. I think that I associated the swimming with two of my classes that I am taking at the present time. The day before I had the dream, I felt that these two subjects were ""pulling me down"" and I was swamped with work in these two classes.

He had installed a long copper pipe running from this guy's rented room to his room a few floors below in the same block. He managed to persuade him that this pipe went into the earth, and that you could communicate with God by knocking on the pipe in some kind of morse code. 2.

"I was in CHV planning a regional conference. I'm not sure who everyone was that I was working with. Barry C was there but I don't know how involved he was. I started driving home and saw the Catholic Church. It's quite possible in waking life, but I was in TH and CHV. Not sure how to explain except that I was in downtown TH and their church. I was driving through downtown CHV to go meet Barry C. When I saw the church, it had many beautiful stained glass windows. I decided that I had to stop for just a minute. I saw Reagan U and she told me where to park. I was concerned because it didn't seem like an appropriate place but she assured met hat it was and why. Something like, if anyone asks, she would make a certain gesture and they would then understand. She went into the church with me. It was as though five Masses were going on. It was not beautiful inside. I was wondering why I had gone on so to Reagan U about how beautiful it was. On the outside, I had seen these beautiful stained-glass windows. I was looking around inside trying to find them. I decided I needed to go bed because Barry C would be waiting. Reagan U left with me. We were sitting on an open-air vehicle of some kind. A man came running out shouting Good News! Good news! I was saying something like that referring to God. Several other men followed him. They were carrying Mass cups of wine. They approached our vehicle. The first man was short, blonde hair. Later, I realized that is the man Reagan U is secretly in love with. One of the men was Ernest Hartman. I drank from his cup. The next thing I knew I was back in my car trying to figure out how to get to where I was meeting Barry C. I guess I was on a cell phone because he said he was going to double back to Druiz St. to turn on the street that we both needed to be on. Right after that, I crossed over Druiz St. and realized I missed it and had to go back also. Maybe some of this was before the church. I think I got lost and this is when I saw the church. After the church, and back in my car, I saw Reagan U in her car and realized she was going to lead me to where I needed to be. I think I was driving to fast because I had to go over two lanes, into a left turn lane, to keep from rear-ending her. My first thought was how I was going to get back behind her. Then I thought I should just give her an okay sign with my fingers and find it on my own. I also realized Barry C would be wondering where I was since I was taking so long. I also realized that I didn't know where we were meeting, only the street. I wondered if I should just go home even though I couldn't let him know that I was doing that.",Negative

"I was lying in bed, and suddenly awoke, to- find the thing pressing against my side was a set of crystal cups & saucers, which I then perceived were broken. I was not, however, conscious of there being any sharp edges or splinters, but knew I had to pick up the pieces. Then the dream just sort of faded away. Interpretation The cups & saucers were our actual set, & they do break easily, but I've never worried about breaking them. Answers to questions 2. Perplexed, I think3. Yes.4. Neither5. No6.

"I am floating in the air, on a flat, stiff, rectangular piece (of ?), about 15 or 20 feet from the floor. There is a moderate wind blowing, and this moves me slowly forward. Below me on the floor, or ground, is a ladder, and I call to a black man (one of the black force at the National Museum) to set this up against my (? carpet). (I am on hands and knees.) He does so, placing ladder on side as to hold the (?carpet) stationary. He also steadies ladder by bracing his foot against bottom rung. I then start to climb down, but after a step or two I decide to tumble down rest of way, as I feel sure he will be unable to hold ladder in place long enough for me to climb down. Accordingly I partially double up and fall, apparently with no fear of injury. On the ground I am offered my choice between an ax and a hatchet, the latter an old, dull, and rust encrusted specimen. I choose the hatchet and begin chopping up a very large plank (2 or 3 inches thick and about 15 inches wide). I have little difficulty in cutting up the plank, though the pieces look rather too long for use in a stove of furnace and I think they (or some of them) will need to be subdivided further. I also hack away at 8 or 10 foot high stub of a large tree. some distance from the ground is a large hollow in the trunk and around this are some insects, probably some sort of wasps (not bright colored and not very large, about size of Trypoxylon) which I watch rather closely to avoid being stung. Farber has an extensive revision of the chapter well along toward completion, and he now appears and examines the tree. His general bearing and remarks shows that he is an expert, and he points out that certain changes have taken place, particularly in regard to a small mass of gluey consistency near the cavity (on lower edge of cavity) which has now changed into an elongate piece (square in cross-section) of something about as firm as a piece of cheese. It is dirty white in color, with marmoustions.... of a grayish-green color (like marble cake). It is now disclosed that Farber, on a recent collecting trip, brought back a small piece of a plant for identification. Before handing it to a botanist, Farber tells someone what he (Farber) thinks the plant will prove to be; and later, the botanist announces that it is ""caroliniana or variety"" which is exactly what Farber had thought. This shows not only his extensive knowledge but also his keen reasoning power.",Negative
"I dreamt of cuddling with a big gorilla.  Later it was my old online friend Marty in a costume.  I accidentally left some records there, behind the one-way mirror where he stayed most of the time.  There was a fountain, and Nathan Lane came out and did magic tricks with glasses and eggs.  There was a flame, and my father was impressed by the last trick.  We left.  Colorful cylinders connected to make a big tube we traveled through.  Sparkly and glittery lights.  I said it was like the Small World ride, or more like ET in Universal Studios.",Negative
"I was in a department store. Later I was on the grounds of a hospital which resembled the one across the street from one of the houses I lived in when we lived in St. Louis, Missouri. There was a wall about ten feet high from the sidewalk to the hospital grounds. The ground level of the hospital grounds was about two feet lower than the wall. (As a child I once tried to climb that wall to get to an injured robin. I think I succeeded in doing so.) In this dream I was on the grounds, and I was wishing I could climb down to get away from the hospital. I told someone that I chased a pig. I related how I caught it and it struggled. (Yesterday I read that though scientists can study the origin of life by tracing human life down to atoms, they cannot reverse the analysis and retrace their steps. Only the tracing of atoms to electrons can be reversed. This may have suggested the return to a childhood scene.) This time I was trying to get away from the hospital instead of onto the hospital grounds.",Negative
"I go to visit someone for a while. The woman asks me if I think the style of her house is Western. I walk around looking at the outside of her house. At first I say, ""Yes,"" but then I reconsider. I say, ""No, a western style house would be more open. It would have large windows and clean, simple lines."" At the back of her house I see flagstone siding and a small square enclosed porch with a high peaked roof. She says, ""I never even use this space."" I say, ""I think your house is more Cape Cod."" I then decide I want to take the day off to go home and relax, and to go swimming in the pool. I try to gather up my belongings and the people I came with. I can't seem to carry all my belongings, a basket of dirty laundry, some books and papers. The woman tries to help me. I call to Ellie who is up high on the tower roof of the nextdoor castle. She's starting to climb down the outside wall like repelling down a mountain. I am concerned for her. I think, ""That sure is like Ellie, taking risks!"" Dwight comes down and gets ahead of her so in case she falls, she'll land on him. She takes the last jump and does land on him. He is hurt. His foot might be broken. I go to them, concerned, and check out his foot. Now, we're on an airplane to go home. It's time to board and I'm still juggling all my stuff.

"I am at an intersection. I take a left turn but have to go back and return. Then I am at a place en route to Boston. I take a left turn and there I come up to a crossing where each street is one way the wrong way, so I can't continue. At my right there is a gray-haired woman, a depressed patient I saw in a mental hospital for a while. She is on a bicycle as I am trying to turn to go back. I bump into her slightly and she becomes completely hysterical the way she'd be on the ward. She shrieks, ""To think that you believed that you would get a Nobel Peace prize!"" ""I never thought that; you always said that,"" I reply. She is now my mother, very irritated. My reply shuts her up because it is true. ""But where do you have to go?"" I ask. We are on the side of the divided parkway where I'm traveling back home. ""I have to go to the bar mitzvah of Robbie."" She means the other boy who was called Robbie in my childhood. I ask her where. She tells me. ""So maybe you can go straight, but it is a long, long bicycle ride."" She says, in an irritated voice, ""Just let me be!"" It sounds like my mother in the dream with my father's bon vivant brother, annoyed and martyrish. She becomes my depressed patient again.

"I was in Haydn Hall, in the snack bar. Girls were selling tickets. One of the girls at the table was a friend of mine. Joan was a freshman. I saw a ring on her finger, but at first thought nothing of it. As I looked at the ring, I finally realized she was engaged. I went up to her and wished her the best of everything. I looked at the ring, which was not small or large, but very pretty and unusual. It looked more like a costume ring than a regular engagement ring. We talked about her future plans. She said that she and her fiance, who was a Beta, were planning on getting married in August. I, at this point, for the first time, noticed her Beta pin and tried to recall when she got pinned. I told her how lucky she was to be getting married and complained about the fact that it would be at least 2 years before I could get married. At this time more people seemed to be coming in Haydn for lunch. Several of my classmates were seated around a table. It seemed as if I was involved in the conversation with the people from my own class and was at the same time trying to learn from Joan if she would be back to school next year.

"I'm doing a 3-point turn in a cul-de-sac. I then park the car on one side. A nosey neighbor then comes out of his new-build to say ""you shouldn't park there - it's on a slope."" I look, but there's no slope - it looks flat to me. But at the end of the culled-sac there is a drop. It dropped away like a sheer cliff - there was no fence. I went off somewhere with my partner. I returned later and somehow my car had rolled off the edge of the road and 'on to' the top branches of a huge tree that was growing up from below (the tree top was level with the road).  My car was so tantalisingly near, but it would be dangerous to try to get into the car while it was balancing on the tree. The neighbor came out again, gloating. ""I told you didn't I?"" he said. ""You won't get that car from here. You'll have to shake it out of the tree and get it from the bottom."" For some reason I thought I could actually do that that, so I went down some steps and came to the base of the tree. What I didn't notice before was that the tree was growing up the side of a factory - a concrete carpark-like structure that seemed partially open to the sky. The tree hung over the factory. There were workers around. I shook the tree and to my surprise all sorts of large objects started falling out of the tree into the factory - pieces of masonry and plaster for example - some pieces of which landed on people on the factory floor. I was shocked and felt bad about it. I also dreamt a variation: instead of my car stuck in a tree, it's my converse trainers stuck on the factory roof.

"This seems to have taken place sometime in the past.

My mother's also in this. She's not directly involved. I'm saying, ""If you want to leave me the house, then leave some money too. It costs to run that house. I'd be happy to do you a favor and take care of it, but I don't want to own that house because it costs too much money."" The figure 9 and the figure 5 fit in there somewhere.

Then a little while later, I was at this big dome house with a living room that had all glass windows so you could see out. There were a whole bunch of kids playing in the front yard. My mom was talking to her friend and I came out of nowhere. Then the phone rang. My mom didn't answer it. But she stood up and walked along the sidewalk. Then she threw her back out and I had to help her walk to nowhwere in specific. Then we came back. Setting: At my house, and some city street, and a big white dome house. Characters: My mom. Pat, my mom's friend. Kids I don't know. Becka's mom. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, sad, scared, worried. I think it was weird that Becka's mom called, because she had just called before I went to bed and my mom didn't answer.",Positive
"I looked at a selection and I saw Fireball Zack picked as a winner. A canary and spider were fighting. The spider got the canary dizzy and groggy. I broke them apart. Ann and I came home from work the same time. Sabruck was our insurance man again. He was in overalls. Bill Grove and I were in the Richman Bros. Co. looking at different machines and at flaws in leather and clothing. My large toenail was broken. I pulled it partly off and I noticed my small toe was like half squeezed flat on the side. I shook the rest of the nail and it was coming loose, so I left it alone.",Negative
"Am in a rented car and stop in a city street and park. Walk past an open store and see piles of cartons containing junk apparently and I walk in and start rummaging thru. Find old clothes and papers and at the same time a woman is looking thru the same carton. We speak in Spanish. I then note at the other side of room a meeting of men from my office. This is a meeting which I had declined to attend, saying I was much too busy. They look at me and wonder what I am doing there with the cartons. I walk past them, saying nothing, and look at my watch as though I was late for something. It says 10 pm, almost, and I reach for a phone to call home. Find the phone, but the receiver is at the end of a long wire and hidden behind some other cartons. I go into another office and it apparently belongs to a church. There are women and children in the room waiting for a minister. I don't phone, but walk out to car which I find parked off the street and on an asphalted lot. I swing into traffic just as light changes, cutting off other cars and manage to get to my lane and speed off.",Negative
"Enrique Iglesias (he's 23) and Alicia (23) (both singers) were going to sing here, but no one knew them so the manager, the one that was in charge, told me to sing for Alicia.

"I'm with Aunt Naomi and Uncle Gus. There's a volcano going to erupt. Uncle Gus wants to go see it, but I don't. I feel scared. There are children, half grown, and several boys who have grown beards. One has a girl with him. He says, ""I never knew what anything meant until I met her, and now I'm alive."" We're high on a mountain peak. Uncle Gus takes us down to the flat lands. He shows us a fancy yacht he gets to drive. I look closely. I say, ""Oh, isn't it on fire? Are those flames coming out of it?"" Uncle Gus runs to look. My ""dad"" is watching the flames. Uncle Gus is sad now. Then I feel the volcano starting to erupt. I run back toward the mountain peak house, calling for my daughters to hurry. I find Dovre and Paulina, but Ellie is in the shower being stubborn, unaware of the danger. I call insistently. She comes out. We run and run. Then the ""children"" are climbing up a cathedral-like thing and the statues of angels and Mary break in the earthquake and fall and kill some of the children. My daughter is safe. A little boy is not. He dies. I sorrowfully pick up a little angel statue and cry out at the awfulness of the children dying by these statues. A jeep pulls up. 2 men are in it. One is a bearded ""son"" and his friend. They are drunk. I tell the friend. He doesn't want to believe the boy died. He asks, ""But there were 2 groups of children, he was in the group that was safe, eh?"" I sadly said, ""No."" The bearded man cried out in anguish and sorrow. With no child, there is no reason to live. He rails against the religious figures that killed his son.",Negative
"My mother offered me a white container of some sort of peanut butter.  I dipped something, perhaps a cracker in it to taste it.

"I had a job interview at McDonald's. It was done by two girls. People in the shop were being loud and people were coming in and one of the girls yelled that the job interview was taking place. I was embarrassed and I wasn't sure how it was going. The meaner one left. The chocolate in the sundae machine was spilling and mixing with the ice cream and I warned her. I was only allowed to work for a maximum of 20 hours a week and I was thinking that I needed to change it so I could work longer. Some cop/forensic guy did something and someone called him a ""douche""? He marked this thing from 100 down to 71 thinking that no-one would notice and it got people in trouble originally, until they realized it measured itself automatically, so they double checked the machine's records with his. Then I was doing a dungeon with Ezra. Eugene and others were in a 'pub' nearby and when we were in the dungeon we could hear them talking. They were fans of the Harry Potter movies [note: last night there was a FilmForum video which used Harry Potter movies as an example]. There was this new thing with floating rooms. Couples usually rented them. It was unknown to them, but the walls were glass so they could see through and all the rooms would float together in this big 'room' (it was kind of like The Matrix). From the top, you could see everything. It showed some couples cuddling, kissing, some having sex and one guy was masturbating alone. Then Jason Segel and I were in a room. He was my boyfriend. We were having sex, on our side and he was behind me. I was watching Smallville and Clark said ""fuck"" twice and I thought that was weird. It was a weird, complicated episode. Then I was watching Queer as Folk. Hazel (from the UK one) was in it, and Michael (the US one) was her son. Then Mom and I were in the car and we went to one of her friends. They were trying to impress me and I was yawning.",Negative
"I found a bracelet which I haven't seen for a couple of years. The bracelet is gold and has a marble attached to it (the marble is clear) and contains a mustard seed. The bracelet was given to me when I was almost ten by my grandma, who told me that the tiny seed represented faith in God. In my dream I found the bracelet but it was now silver and the marble was clouded over. I frantically rubbed the marble and little by little it became clear again. I don't remember if I polished the marble until I saw the seed, but I'm sure it was inside. I don't think that was the important part though.",Positive

She was an extraordinarily good-looking girl and was attracting quite a bit of attention from the other men on the beach. We then drove to her home and had sandwiches and beer.

I wondered if there would be space but I wanted only to wash a few articles. Then I was washing a red figured dress by pouring water about two inches deep on it as it lay spread out on the bed. I told a woman to remove her yellow dress from beside it lest it get wet. She said, ""yes, it might discolor your dress."" I said, ""I was thinking about your dress, not mine.""",Positive

"I had to take three more classes at Westport College this summer and they were going to be like theory classes and like fun stuff, almost like art classes. And I was deciding which ones they would be. And I dreamt that Dad had this, either a violin or a dulcimer or a mandolin or something that he found either at a garage sale or in the dumpster, and he taught himself to play it. I can't remember what song it was, but he was trying to teach himself, ""Oh Shenandoah."" And he was also, he knew ""This Land is Your Land,"" and I was feeling his fingers and how they were moving while he was playing it, and I was thinking, ""Wow, isn't this cool? I thought he would never learn such a thing."" And he was going to teach me, but I was kind of embarrassed at first, I don't know why. And this dream mostly consisted of those notions, and sitting out in the front yard and watching Dad play his instrument, whatever it was. And then I was in this big yellow room again and Mom was asking me what kind of classes was I going to take. And I remember she was saying it was okay if I took an online class, because I think I've still got it in the back of my head that I would rather take that music theory class than speech because it's an online thing. And that's pretty much it in a nutshell.",Negative
"I was in a medical school or maternity ward. Doctor and students grouped around a pregnant woman--or specialists with other doctors--she had big bulging belly but no pudenda. He was curious as to how she conceived--through anus was some of speculation. He split it and out came baby. The area was hairless and smooth as any skin. Afterwards--a lapse of days?--the woman was sexy and asked me to rub the newly made pudenda, especially the clitoris that was revealed or discovered or uncovered for first time. Some joy of sharing that first experience, but not complete ecstasy since a lingering memory of operation in that area, though operation and birth not ugly or bloody. (The language of the doctors was quite scientific, some big words I don't remember.)",Negative

The third one sat with her knees up, and replied to something the others had said with, ""I have already given in to the temptation."" Then ran their hands over their legs. Then they looked in my direction, and one said, ""let's go into the other room."" I surmised that they had been embarrassed in my presence. I felt resentful about it. Then a nun came and rested the back of her head against my groin for a moment. Then she got up and seemed to be angry at herself for what she had done.",Negative

"I was saying ""miss"" and then there must have been an interruption/commotion. After, I think someone answered me with a rude remark. It was some sort of takeoff on a play and the part that I was reading, but the surroundings were not correct. It came and went quickly, or so it seemed. P.S. I think that I was so excited about this new dream journal that I tried to control my dream too much. That's why I can't elaborate. Setting: In a green room instead of a stage, as if the play was in real life. More like an office painted green. Characters: I was there, but as a different lady. Everyone else was unfamiliar. I think they were all busy, bustling around, with no time for my lady, even though she worked there with them. Feelings and Thoughts: Neutral. I don't think much of it.

"(04/17/00)[""Unhelpful Triple A man.""] I am in the passenger side of the van. I hired a man to help drive it. I feel a shimmy in the front wheels like a tire trying to work itself off an axle. He stops the truck suddenly on the side of the road. He refuses to drive it another inch. It's too dangerous he says. I look ahead and see we are about to enter a tunnel going down with a left turn in it. I see why he stopped. It would be terrible to have it break down in the tunnel. It would stop traffic and inconvenience everyone. But I am also annoyed because I think we could make it. It's a calculated risk. He is adamant. We get out of the truck and are now sitting in a cafe at a table. Other people are coming in and out and sometimes sitting with us. Women with babies. I have Charla and other children with me. I say to the man you can't just leave us here. We have to finish the journey. He doesn't respond. I then remember I could call Triple A. Then I remember he is a representative of Triple A. He could call and get a tow truck and a vehicle for us to travel in. He walks down a very steep ramp and I follow, nearly falling as it is so steep. He seems to be looking for a tow truck. I follow him, frustrated. Now he goes back up, disappearing. I go back to the cafe and now I have lost my place at the table. The cafe is crowded. No place for me to sit. And Charla and the children are missing. I am worried and annoyed. I decide to check the bathroom. I look at the bathroom door to see if I can find the Women's room. The sign is confusing. A woman comes out so I decide it is the women's room. I go in. A mesh screen is over the toilet. No children or Charla. I go out again, worried.",Negative
"I'm attending a family function. BJ leaves to go home driving her car. Well she's in her old white car. I leave also, driving my car in following her to her house because I don't know how to get there from where we are. At one point we are driving along side each other carrying on a conversation yet it seems as though we're sitting next to each other. However, who were because she keeps turning to look at me when she is speaking to me she also is tending to move her steering wheel in that direction causing her car to get even closer to mine. I become very concerned that one of these times she's actually going to side swipe me. Because she's driving very close to me as it is. But I don't think she notices how close she is or what she's doing when she turns to talk to me. Doing this causes me to turn my steering wheel a bit to avoid her hitting me which causes me to run off the road a little bit several times. I finally say something to her and she gets back over in her own lane. But then she takes off and gets way ahead of me. At one point she just drives across some grass to get on the highway she wants to be on. I'm very uncomfortable with this, but feel like I have to do the same because I need to stay behind her or I won't know how to get to her house. I'm in her car with her and she pulls all to the side of the road at a place where there are numerous interchanges at one place. And she's trying to figure out how to get on the section of highway that she needs. We have seen someone driving very fast down one lane that appears to be a one way lane. There's a worn placed in the grass between us and where that lane is, that looks like a lot of people have used that to get over there. So she decides that's what she's going to do and that she's just going to do it very fast to try to avoid getting caught or causing an accident. It is dangerous. I ask her if I should go get in my own car and she agrees that that's a good idea. That way when I do get to her house I will be able to leave whenever I'm ready without needing to get a ride back to my car. There is a large Whiteboard hanging on a wall and someone has used a green marker and written on it. It's relative to this same dream. It seems to be directions. There are also two white metal chairs, the kind that mother and daddy have on their patio. They are sitting parallel to the Whiteboard.",Negative
"Dad still lived at the old house. I was staying over. Ezra and Roland were there too, along with Stephen Merchant. We were out the front. Roland said he could hear a noise from the woodshed and said that 'someone was in there', but we ignored him. Then we were out the back sitting at a table. Stephen wrote on a bit of paper and signed it Stephen MerchanT -- the S and T being significantly bigger, especially the T, and I said 'the T's almost as tall as him'. He laughed. Then we were out the front again and Steve said he heard something in the woodshed. Dad went to check it out and came back with a bruise on his face, saying 'he hit me'. Apparently there was a family of around 20 Chinese people living in there. There was a hole in the laundry window that they came in through. I went to look and saw a lady using the sink in the laundry. I screamed. I went to the living room and another one came out and put her hands on my face. Someone said it was some ritual and so I stood there, stiff, and she made me kneel, then she bowed and I bowed back and I was thinking 'I thought that was a Japanese thing', but just went along with it.",Negative

They were my personal binders but I found some documentation in them that belonged to the sleep center. I pulled those out and gave them to Lilly H and asked her to put them back where they belong, with the sleep center files. There was something about the insurance. I had asked them who was doing that now and they said no one. I said, You mean they decided to just go back to not collecting from the insurance companies.

"I could walk from home to my high school somehow, or maybe not. Maybe I was even back at Bancroft Middle School, but I could walk to school. But I had the option to take the bus home if I wanted. And I had to deposit some money in the Mercantile Bank. I don't remember why, but the one day I didn't make it over there because class let out before they were still open, after it had closed, I guess, I couldn't get in. And the next day I was going to try and get over there. You know how we had a situation where our car battery was kind of weak, and for a while there we thought it was because the radio, like the digital tuner, had to draw memory supply of power with the yellow layer that was a very, very little amount? Well, get this! In this dream Dad wanted me to write a letter to the Mercantile Bank asking if they knew anything about why that would happen.

Jeremy had taken the call so I didn't get to hear the details, but it was urgent.  So I drove down the main street, talking to Jeremy on the cell about how to get there.  He said to continue on, and in doing so, I ran into a narrow residential area, and he said I was there.  I went around to knock on the back door, and Jeremy said no, he'd do it.  Lynn's son Jonathan seemed to be the threat, and he's a big kid, quite dangerous when angry.  Ironically we decided Jeremy should go to the door because he'd talked to him recently (on the phone while I was driving) and would know him better- so when Jonathan answers the door, Jeremy should prepare for a hit, and after the first one, Jonathan should recognize him.",Negative

Then Nana and Poppa were meeting Loanne and some evil people out the back. She was magical? This girl said they had spells and were going to do bad stuff. Alyssa was nearby, and I said something about her fat but not being able to get through the door and she heard and got angry. I apologized and she got over it after a few minutes.

"I was at the CAS offices, though they looked different than in waking life. There were several offices. I was sharing an office with Bill C. There was a salesperson name Mike [unknown] that was leaving our employment. He decided that it had been too long since he sold anything and decided it was time for him to move on. He was in his office. He had lots of boxes and was putting his personal belongings in them. I was wondering why Bill C had not told me that Mike was leaving. There were two offices or rooms that were full of extra furniture. Some of it was quite nice. Some of it was quite old, like the old green and gray metal desks. I was looking around thinking that now that Mike was leaving we could each have our own office. I wanted my own office, and yet I realized that working in the same office as Bill C was nice because I could ask him questions quite easily. I can ask him things as they come to mind as opposed to creating a list or having a pile of stuff for him. I was debating if that was what I really wanted to do, yet it somehow felt as though I didn't really have a choice. That is what we were really going to do. I was in one of these rooms with all this furniture in it. I was moving things around. I was debating about switching my furniture to something nicer that I saw in one of these rooms. There was something about Haley N and me sharing an office now. Of course, I did NOT want that. I think that's when I had the idea that we had the space now for each member of the staff to have their own office. Yet, still that it was convenient for me to share an office with Bill C. I was also thinking about the fact that we had all this extra furniture there. It was probably stuff that we would never use. It was just taking up space and it was just messy-filling up both rooms the way it was. There was no rhyme or reason to the way that it was in the rooms. It looked as though someone had just arrived it in and sat it anywhere. It was all sitting at different angles and such. I started moving some things around and I was going to try to organize the rooms a little bit. There were all kinds of different pieces, like different types of desks and different types of bookshelves. While I was moving this stuff around I also came upon these things that were shaped like hearts. They were probably about 3 ft x 3 ft. I'm not sure what they were made out of. I don't think they were all made out of the same thing. There were a bunch of them that seemed to be made out of Mylar - silver Mylar. I was trying to gather them up and put them in a nice neat pile. Bill C's wife came in. She was talking about all of this furniture. Then Bill C came in and was helping. He started moving things around. It was very easy for him - as though the furniture weighed ounces rather than pounds. He would pick up two or three pieces at a time and move it. He was stacking it, back to back along the wall-one or two walls.",Positive
"Actually we were riding around doing errands with Betsy. It was me and Mom and Dad and Betsy were all in the car, and there was someone else with us. And we were riding around to different stores and things, and it was time to get ourselves some food. And for some reason Dad knew of this van that would be parked by the police station, and this van would have like all kinds of food rations and little things that they give to prisoners. And for some reason, somehow, they were going to let us have some, if it was anything we really wanted, right? I mean, it was so, they had like little spools of thread and little socks, little containers of food and just diddly things in different drawers and things. And we got Betsy some things from there, and someone was telling us the story of this food that fell in the mud and how they took like thousands of bacteria processes and things and somehow cleaned it up, and they don't know what they did or how they did or if it was safe. They just know they did it. And next we _________ parking lot and for some reason there was a fire truck, and for some reason Dad had to move it. And he said something about, ""Go over to one side,"" like over around to the left, ""and go out of the parking lot and wait for me over somewhere else."" Well, for some reason, instead of going left, I went right, and he was backing the truck up. And I thought that he wanted us to get in the truck so that we could keep going. So I went around the back of the truck over to the passenger side, and I was so close to getting run over. The truck was like touching me, almost about to knock me over. It was moving slowly, slowly. So I just climbed onto the bumper for lack of a better way to say it. I just climbed onto it and hung on so that he could do all his maneuvering and I wouldn't get run over. And he kept turning it and stuff, and eventually I managed to tap on the door. And I don't remember what happened after that. I don't even remember us getting back in our car to go home. Then I woke up.",Negative
"I dreamed that James Bond lived in my basement and was having a huge party. There were 6 bars, strippers, gamblers, kegs, and lots of music and everything. I went down there and people were playing card games. But the people weren't real. I guess I just asked why the people weren't real. Someone told me that James Bond was impersonal. So the fake people represented the superficiality of them. I went back upstairs.

"I am watching as a disembodied observer. I see an old lady on a motorcycle. She refuses to put hub caps on her back wheels. She wants the spokes exposed. She wears leather and is feisty and independent. However, she decides she wants a job. She offers to be a delivery person for messages. She is hired, but as she takes the leather message pouch and lays it on the back wheel, the employer insists she cover the spokes with a hub cap. It annoys her a bit, but she complies because she thinks the job will be fun and she can see the sense of it. After all, it would not be safe to let the bag get caught up in the spokes when she's driving. So she takes the pouch with the papers inside to her destination. When she gets there, there are forms to fill out and she has lots of difficulty getting this done.",Positive

"My brother used to study at the School of Detectives of Peru, and not too long ago he started to work; that's how the dream begins. I must point out that my brother was already working in Apurimac, Abancay. It continues this way: Since I think that his work is dangerous, my brother was killed, I cried inconsolably due to the loss of my brother. So that Mother would not see, I went in the bathroom and cried there. They had already buried my brother, but in my dream I said that it wasn't true, that it couldn't be true, and so sleeping and dreaming, I was crying real tears. They were running down my cheeks, but I kept saying that it was a lie, that my brother hadn't died. Then I awoke and looked at his bed and saw it was empty, and then I thought that it was true and that he had died and I started to scream desperately. My father ran to see what was happening and asked me what was the matter and I told him that my brother, my dear brother, where was he, was he dead? And he told me, ""No, he isn't, my child, your brother is in Abancay, working; don't you remember?"" Only then did I realize that it had only been a dream, a horrible dream, and that I would never want this to happen and that is why I pray to God so that he will protect my brother and my boyfriend, because both of them have the same profession, and I think it's dangerous, at least my brother's, because he is not in Lima.",Negative

A true friend would do me the favor even if it didn't give her something at the same time. I start to roller skate through the empty rooms. I go toward the back of the house and into the kitchen. I look out a window and see a small, black, old sports car, the new tenant's car. Then I feel uneasy and realize I should go look in the closet. The ""answers"" may be there, long ago forgotten.

"I took a nap in the afternoon, and I had a dream. It started off somewhere on campus, and I was in some building that -- it was a new building and it seemed to be the new language building Day, but it didn't have much resemblance to it and it wasn't in the same place. But I was in there with my daughter, and with this girl who has been in several of my classes before -- in my French classes and in my Dante course this semester. And we were talking while we were walking out of the building. And I was going with my husband -- I'm not exactly sure exactly where we were going, or where we had been. There was something about a car auction, and this whole group of people that had been at this place together were all heading home, starting off together. And we were in this long line of cars, and they were driving very fast and very recklessly, very close to each other. And it seemed very dangerous. And at one point I remember my husband seemed to be passing cars rather recklessly himself. And he decided it was his turn to pass some car in front of us, and a car about two cars behind him pulled out about the time he was getting ready to pass. And he said that wasn't fair, for that car to pull out like that, so he pulled out right in front of it, and sort of ran into the other side of the road. We were going real fast, about 70 or so, and were right in front of this other car, but we got back into the line. And I decided that I would drive for a while because I wouldn't drive that fast. I didn't think it was right. And so I was driving, and the road was sort of narrow and hilly, and there kept being patches of fog on it. All of a sudden would just be this big clump of fog that you couldn't see, and people on both sides o the road were going very fast and driving recklessly. And there was a group of several cars in front of us that seemed to be related in some way, connected in some way, like they were all friends or something that had to get somewhere all together. And one car that was right in front of us all of a sudden went off the road, and went through the fence on the right. And I said that was because they had all been driving too fast and that that whole group eventually something was going to happen to. And we drove on, and all of a sudden, without any warning, came these mountains with these terrific curves, just impossible curves. And it was a very strange narrow little road. It was a very unreal scene, all these narrow, twisting curves and all this fog on the road. I continually couldn't see where I was going and didn't feel like I was controlling the car right. And we went through this mountain, very maze turn of mountain roads for a while and finally came to the end of it. And it was about where I woke up, feeling very drugged from having been asleep in the afternoon, it having been a very hot afternoon. And my husband came home from his meeting with Dr. McCurdy, and brought the car back so I could go to the grocery store. So I had to get up and get my daughter up and go on to the store because it was sort of late in the afternoon, even though I felt dopey, and wasn't real bright and wide awake, and didn't want to drive when I wasn't fully awake. But I did, and I rolled down the window to get lots of fresh air because I felt sort of dazed and in a fog, as it were. And so we were driving to the grocery store and as we got down the highway, about two blocks from where I would turn, all the cars stopped and we had to wait for a while. And when we got up to where the shopping center was, I saw that there had been a sort of big accident, probably not a real serious one. It seemed to have involved about four cars on both sides of the road. And also across from this shopping center is this great bit open field that used to, I don't remember if it still does, have this fence along it, about 100 feet off the road. And for a long time there was a green car that had gone off the road down by the fence. And the car that ran off the road in my dream and went through this fence in a place very similar to what this place actually was, was a green car, sort of an old model. And also I had this dream last night that had just this one element of a car going off a road and through a fence into a field. None of these cars when I saw them were actually off the road, except off to one side of the road, but it was at this place where they were. That's all.",Negative
"I was back in the Westport High School building, but everybody acted like they were taking college classes. I was in this class where we weren't really doing a whole lot of work. Then I was kind of pretty much just finishing a couple things and handing them to the teacher, and then trying to go through and organize, and I had that black g______ thing that I bought for Modern Media College and I had my book bag and I had three or four big bulky magazines on my desk. They were like women in business magazines and stuff. And [laugh] we had a duck and cover drill where ____ said, ""Okay, _________"" and instead of everybody having their own desk, I was jammed in with four other people and I could hardly breathe.

And actually they were going to take a lunch break and then they were going to come back and do some more. Well, I thought I was going to leave all my stuff there and just go take a break. So I went with these two visually impaired people. One seemed really competent and one seemed really, ""duhhhhhh."" And they were talking to me as we were walking up and down the halls, and we were thinking about going to the cafeteria, but I decided I wanted to go get my stuff first. And I said I was going to meet them down in the courtyard. And I met the teacher at the door and the teacher said, ""Oh no, you can't come back in here; we had a fire drill.

"Heather Locklear was going to exercise with me. We were talking about the fact that neither of us really wanted to exercise, or felt like it, but we knew we needed to. We were going to use an exercise video. I was rewinding the tape from the last time we had used it. I was having trouble getting the last few minutes to rewind. The tape didn't look like they do in waking life. The tape itself was much wider, maybe 4 inches wide. There seemed to be a strip of paper wound with the videotape. The paper was just as wide as the tape and about as long as the amount of tape still to be rewound - maybe 10 minutes worth. There was printing on the paper. It reminds me of the strips that some stores hand you with your receipt that have coupons and advertisements on them. I reached in and started pulling that paper out, realizing that's what was causing the problem. I was talking to Heather about this. She didn't think that was the problem but I was sure that it was. Then there was something about emailing someone some web links. She had a lot of piercings on her face, both eyebrows, one or two on her nose, one or two around the mouth area - lips and tongue.

The guy with the mask was on the phone to a girl at the start and mentioned killing a ""skirt"" and then told her to ""look out the window"" and her boyfriend was tied to a chair wearing girls' clothes.

He had become friends with this guy and he went up to his friends and put his arm around them, and snapped his fingers and left. His friends were all confused about it.",Positive
"I dreamed there was this girl, and sometimes it was me and sometimes it was another girl, who'd been hired by my father to count how many trucks of this company (it was the Lion Co.) came into this city along this certain road. And this was because they wanted part of his business, but all of the other trucking firms already had all the business or most of it. And she was hired to live in this very, very fancy penthouse, it was sort of her pay for the job. And she would sit there, with a pair of binoculars, and count the trucks. But then there were these people - it was very sort of science-fiction story-like - who were going to take over the city, and then take over the world. And they had done something in the city, so almost everybody was dead or not there any more, but I and another girl who later turned out to be my sister , and my husband were there. And we were in this big apartment house. And a car stopped in front of it. They were going to come in and search for us. And so we were trying to hide. And I looked around for all sorts of places for us to hide, mainly for me and Barbara, and I was looking for a place for my sister first, and then I was going to hide. And finally my sister decided that in this big closet, sort of one of these dressing room types of closets, very large, that she was going to hide. And she had covered herself partly with boxes and partly with a blanket. But she refused to keep her face covered, because it bothered her. And yet I said that she had to, or these people would find her. And finally I -- after trying to persuade her -- I had to quit and run and hide myself, behind some clothes over in back of the closet, because I could hear these people outside. And they came in and found us both, and had also found my husband wherever he was, and were going to take us away. And we all threw away our I.D. cards because they marked us as being part of the nobility and everybody who belonged to the nobility was going to be killed. And they were going to take us to a prison camp somewhere, but we knew that we would maybe have another chance to get away. And so then it was I and these two other girls. And we were trying to get away from this place that looked like a girl's school. And a bell had rung and everybody was supposed to come back, but we went on and were out near this woods. And some girls that were near there told us not to go down there, because nobody that went down there could ever find their way out. But we knew that was just what we wanted, because we wanted to get away. And so we ran down into the woods. And we hadn't gone very far until we saw my husband lying on the ground with this picnic basket with him. And this seemed sort of innocuous, but we knew -- since he was now on the enemy side -- that he was there to prevent our escaping. And yet it didn't concern me too much because I was very happy to see him, and felt very tender toward him. And I went up to him, and where he was, and lay down and embraced him, and said how sad it was that we were on opposite sides, and supposed to be enemies. And so we were going to stay there with him, and that was about the end of that dream.",Negative
"(04/23/01)[""Traveling with the natives.""] I'm traveling down a dirt road in an Asian country. All the peasants are walking and I am riding a very tall plastic blow up animal. It is mechanized so it moves along. I am way up higher than everyone. The animal is a sort of black ostrich looking thing. I come to a bridge over the road, like another highway going perpendicular. I am too high, so I push a button and the hydraulics of the machine shortens the thing enough so I can get under it. The peasants ignore me, they do not like having me there. They do not respect me. Later, the peasants are running toward the fields and I hear an airplane coming. I realize I am in danger and shorten the machine down to the road and then run with the peasants into the weeds in the field. We hide until the airplane passes. We come out. I see shimmery pamphlets lying all over the road. They could explode if we stepped on them. I now get off my machine and pick up clothes and shoes from dead people on the road so that I am now dressed and acting like a peasant. It is my protection. We come into a room.

"This dream was rather short involving only a few incidents, but was one of the most terrifying dreams I've had. At the start of the dream I was standing alone on a wooded hillside. The area seemed to have been burned over and stumps of trees dotted the landscape. Suddenly a wild boar appeared on the scene. Its face was generalized, but the white tusks showed. The boar started chasing me and I ran for dear life. As I ran the tusks moved closer and I was sure that I would be gored. With the boar at my heels I barely managed to get behind a tree and my heart felt as if it was going to stop from fright. At the side of the wood I noticed a piece of machinery with a flat surface and a vertical saw. The boar climbed up on the machine and was sawed in half. An elephant then appeared and swallowed the boar whole like a snake. The elephant then stretched out its legs and I woke up.",Negative
"Me and Vicki Davis were sitting on the floor in the gym. There were tables set up and lots of strangers and a foreign man, an important fellow who was very neat at a table by himself. There were lockers and gym baskets between the stage and where we were getting ready. We had a Bugs Bunny record to play. We both had books to read and she was dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and I was dressed like Fidel Castro in shorts. We practiced and it was funny but when we went on stage we were 45 minutes late. People were already yawning bored. We failed miserable. I forgot my book to read irrelevant passages from and I had to go back to the locker and get it. Vicki forgot her book. I could not wait for it to be over. Neither could the audience. We were going to take photographs with Jay Mills. He was meeting us at the gallery. He usually rode his bicycle in from Connecticut. He had a favorite hat. It was a McDonalds hard hat. It was obviously a rare out-of-city hat and it had been stolen. William said Mills should wear a NYC McDonalds hat in the city because then nobody would want it. We were getting ready to go and Jay Mills said, ""Merri, you need to get your camera and your lens and your film. They're all in different places inside the gallery.""

She said to change things, and we took down chain segments hanging from the ceiling.  I had graduated but I was still in Mr. Johnson's math class, with math homework every other day.  I had new braces, for 22 teeth on the top and 7 on the bottom, which made me wonder, since I only have 24 teeth total.  The braces were a big, colored, plastic crescent.  Then we were at Universal Studios.  I heard earthquake waling by rides and park equipment, including swings.  It was dangerous.  I was in line- I think to go to the library.

He said he didn't have a car and he wanted to stay around there to have a drink, and if I wanted to, he would find a cab for me. Then I went looking for my friend who was inside the house. I was angry and asked her if she could take me because she had a car, but as she was having tea, she told me to wait a while. Then I became angrier and went out.

I listen to her and then decide to talk with the husband. I go outside to the garden he is working in. I say to him very forthrightly I want 10 minutes of your time to talk about your relationship. I resolve to time myself carefully and be done in nine minutes. I just flat out lay it out for him, figuring he won't take the time to listen and think things through. I say you made her chose between the two things she loves the most. You and Germany. You said if she was to be with him she had to move to his farm and never return to Germany. She did that. And now you remain distant and isolated in your garden. She is very unhappy, but she does as you command. She will die soon at an early age if you continue to deny her emotional connection and autonomy. It will be your fault. He is startled at what I said to him. I look at my watch and see it has been eight minutes. I stop abruptly and say Thanks for your time. Goodbye.

I put the plug in and the thread on the plug must have been stripped because it wouldnÕt tighten up and the air pressure would knock it out.

We were going to sleep in a coal shed. There were about three bulbs that were lit up. There was too much light, so I was going to put them out, but I noticed they were all by an electric switch and I would have to turn the bulb out to shut it off. A fellow gave me a push down a stairway. It was high. He made off as though he was falling, but his intention was to knock me down the steps and over the railing to a drop where I would kill myself. I got hold of a banister and stopped myself. I knew someone was after me, and sure enough, they threw poison bombs at me. I could smell the poison, but I kept going and then it seemed they were chasing another guy. One came around a building and I waited for him. I really gave it to him when he came around. I had him knocked out. I threw him around like a rag doll. He was a hillbilly and he had two babies. Ann looked at them and said, ÒHow old are they?Ó and I said, ÒThe larger one is 4 years old.Ó ÒI thought they were small for their age,Ó she said. Then I saw a big fly on the babyÕs neck.

He's holding the rock up to a picture and they are identical. He calls it a long Latin-like name. I am surprised he could find it. He then takes off his shirt, maybe to get down to work. I notice he's gained some weight and it looks good on him. I want to go hug him and cuddle, but he moves on. He's now straightening up the magazines on the coffee table. One is Life Magazine and the front cover picture looks alive.

He accused me of doing something which I hadn't done. He said I broke a rule. I told him that I did not do it, but he would not believe me, and he said he was going to punish me.

"I was walking around outside. I was sitting on a stone ledge. Connie B and Susan J were there. I was talking to Connie B about the old house. She said there were so many people living in there with her right now. She was so frustrated. She said the families, and one maybe in particular, had a bunch of cats living with her in her room. One part of the dream I am with Paulette W, Joan Collins, and another woman. There is a man there too. Paulette W and this other woman and I are under the control of Joan Collins. I don't know why. We're so afraid of her that we will do whatever she tells us. She tells us that it's time to go have sex again. Something happens to interrupt us and the man and Joan Collins and the other woman walk away and I am talking to Paulette W. We're getting dressed and washing up and talking about how horrible this is and how much we don't want to do this. We decide to get dressed hurriedly and try to get out of there before she comes back so she can't find us. I'm not quite dressed and we here her coming. So I just grab my clothes and we take off running for the elevator. We realize that we don't have time to make it to the elevator so we run into a bathroom. We each go into a stall and close the door but we stand on the toilet so they can't see our feet. Someone, and I don't know if it is one of us or someone else, is actually going to the bathroom when they come in looking for us. They obviously don't see us because we are standing on the toilets and can't see our fit or anything. I am afraid that she may be able to see our heads above the top of the door so I am trying very hard to make sure she doesn't see any part of me.",Negative
"(07/22/00)[""Bill Clinton's feelings are hurt.""] I am in an office talking with people about starting a new magazine.. I have lots of ideas for themes and quickly write down 6 themes. I excitedly take them to the woman boss. I have a hard time convincing her of the merits of the first theme. I explain it to her. We will have lots of work to do. Now I decide to drive somewhere. I get into a black 4 wheel drive jeep and drive up a slushy snowy hill. As I reach the top, the jeep becomes a heavy sleek black wheelchair. I am now in a line of people waiting in a large room to be introduced to Bill Clinton. Finally it is my turn. He sits on a couch and I am seated in front of him. Some man says ""with women"" and Bill Clinton as a conversational starter says. ""I was with a woman once."" I laugh and say Oh REALLY?? Very sarcastic, joking him. His face clouds up and become frozen with anger. He glares at me. I realize my social mistake and quietly and sincerely apologize. I am so sorry. I repeat it twice. He slowly smiles again, but I'd made a big mistake laughing at him.",Negative
"I was participating in a Marathon. Acutally, it was more like a triatholon in three sections. I was amazed that i was doing this since i dont run and had never practiced for this. I was one of the first people at the starting line so I had a head start above the crowds. We ran out of the city for awhile and then on these nature paths through the woods up this hill/mountain. Most of the time I was running by myself. At the top there was a stopping station. Here, we were given drinks and were examined by a doctor. They weighed me and I had lost 13 lbs. from sweating so much. They gave me a shot in the arm and sent me off again. For the next event we were riding unicycles. They passed them out as we went out the door. I had never ridden one before but I saw how other people were doing it and just followed them. I found that I was a natural at the unicycle. I could push the pedals really hard and control it beautifully. In this part of the race I moved ahead even further. Some parts of the course were nature trails. The next stopping point was hard to find - it was sortof like a scavenger hunt so i wasn't positive i was going in the right direction. Someone tipped me off though and i found it. I had to meet more doctors at this place. It was a white fishing house on the bay overlooking the city in the distance. Anyway, the exam was more thorough and this time I had to take a lot more medication. Andrew gave me a shot this time and the nurse crushed up this white crystal rock substance so that it was in big granules and told me to snort it and hold the rocks in my nostrils. I was hesitant about this but did it anyway. After a second, I blew that shit out of my nose and into the garbage. When I was ready to continue with the third event - running back to the city - there were masses of people outside the house waiting for their exams and mullling around. There were a bunch of pillows set up on the floor of the big porch for those who chose the alternative third event - the guitar playing marathon. I saw Allen and Johnny sitting down with their guitars and sheet music - all sweaty and exhausted. The pillowspaces were gettin filled up quickly. I took off running but felt really off rhythm so i could barely run. A lot of the crowd had caught up with me. I barely passed a group of women who were walking the course. The end of the race was downtown and GirlToucher was supposed to play. [Andy = boyfriend; Allen and Johnny = friends; GirlToucher = college band]",Negative
"I dreamed I flew. I didn't feel my body. I was a cloud over the ocean. I felt happy, but I didn't have a body. I could look at the big ships, but felt far from them, although I was on top of them. It was a strange feeling. I was like a cloud, but I didn't have any shape or body. I was vaporous and transparent. It was only an instant and then I felt that I fell and fell and instead of crashing, I went right through the ship, the fish, the sea birds without feeling anything. It was a strange feeling. I was, or was conscious of being, but I wasn't limited, that is, things just didn't affect me. It was a calm but strange dream.",Negative

I said, ""You know Hank, tell me."" He said, ""I don't know and I don't know the names of the horses."" As he walked away, he said Corralee or Correlee would win the first race.

"This was similar to the dream before. We were being held at a house. I went to the toilet and there were no walls. Then there were vampires and so we were staking them. There was a couple having sex standing up in some clothes racks. I walked in on them and said ""carry on"" and left. There were two dodgy guys starting to walk towards them -- they were vampires. This girl, who was part of the bad guys, seemed to not like the bad guy side. We said we needed something and mouthed for her to say to let us out. She had Turk (Scrubs) in like, a cage.

We would have to use a knife to jimmy the two doors south of us open.  We did that, and there was a door off to the left.  I sat down a small laptop and hooked it up.  It mapped out the room in front of us with several red dots throughout.  Those were some sort of sensors that had to be shut off, and I ran a program to find the number key to do so for each one.  I was having fun, but my mother came and walked into the room before I could disable the code.  She said it didn't matter, but I was disappointed- she ruined the game.",Negative

I don't want to walk all the way around the dock. I want to jump in and swim across to the other part of the dock. The water is very dark: black. I'm not sure how deep it is, and am afraid of jumping in. I swing down on the dock, below it, holding onto the wood, and drop into the water, swimming the short distance to where the dock continues. We walk on, Kevin is next to me. We move quickly and deftly. There are grates on our path that close in front of us as we approach them. Kevin slides under some of these. I slow down: I'm not up for sliding under closing doors. The doors open up, they are like automatic garage doors. I grab some of them as they close, lifting them up, opening them.

Some guy who helped make Sims 3 had added a train in it after some guy gave him a map, which had like Australia on top of Canada and everything was all close together. It took 37 seconds to travel around the whole thing. I was then at a shop and there was a huge row of computers. They had Sims 3 on them and there were a lot of computers (thousands).

"(4/8/88)...I'm supposed to be getting on the bus, and I'm just finishing up something - I've been working hard and it's down to the wire and I'm determined not to make a mad dash for it, keep cool, stay in control, don't panic. The front of this place, at least, is a jumble of big things, like it's under construction, and I've left my jacket and purse and one or another things out here, I'd actually almost forgotten that. Everybody else has already gotten on the bus, including George - there's a lot of people I know here - maybe all of them - and we're working here on this big ""project"", I guess, and it's quitting time for the day. I just considered what I was doing crucial enough to stay to finish. But now I see I can make the bus (I think) if I don't waste any time, but I'm not gonna hurry. I collect my things, one by one, and make it to the bus door just as they're closing it. There are 2 guys at the door, bus uniforms, at least the ""doorman"" is black, very businesslike. The ""doorman"" opens the door for me again, and I get on. The bus is huge, and yellow. It's yellow outside and inside the seats might be gold or something, very elegant. This is a new bus, I'd read they were buying new ones, this is a neat thing - the seats are like coach seats, taller, deeper, and the center one of each bank is higher and has some antique-y looking trim. I thought it would be entirely filled up, but there are quite a few seats. I make my way to the back looking for where I want to sit and about the middle of the bus I drop something right next to Eric. As I get down to pick it up I see there's a seat open next to him and I wonder if he'll be disappointed if I don't sit there or if other people will think I should. But I don't want to, I want to sit and be quiet. I go on back - there's a kitchenette/bar on the right - that's neat - nobody doing anything there, though, maybe that's for special events. I find the back seat open (where I usually sit) - there's some litter on the seat, but this is fine. This bus is quite elegant, it's a trip being first ones on it. By the way, as I'm coming up to the bus, just in time: I'm aware that the people on the bus already are anxious for me to make it - there's no calling out or coaching or celebration when I do make it, but I know that they are sort of tensed up, mentally urging me on and there's a feeling of relief when I get there and the man opens the door for me. Earlier: I'm in a house, and there are 2 televisions - a woman and a man are there, and there's a special television show we all want to see. She decides to go to the other TV in another room where she's more comfortable, but (I'm interrupted and come back to find) she hasn't got the channel in clear. I check and discover it's because she changed it by the dial instead of the remote control - she goes to find it and I poke around. I find there are automatic scan switches like the remote has, and try those. It works better, but real slow. I haven't even gotten to that station by the time she gets back. Oh, yes, and in some scene or other I discover that the toe of one of my black boots has come apart - unstuck from the sole, it looks pretty seedy - I will surely have it fixed (it'll cost money, ooh) but right now I'm trying to hide it.",Negative

I remember the beach being very small, and as we looked out into the sea, I saw a very ferocious whale. I was not afraid of it though. It might have been a sperm whale. Then I recall going into a lighthouse with the child my age. It was a very odd lighthouse with many long windy stair cases. The last thing I remember is that there was a head (I think I was male) and it was in a case and as you turned a sharp object pierced the heat. I was very disgusted, but not as much frightened.

I think there was some concern about what we would do if we had too many people register since the call can only handle 150 participants. I was thinking that I needed to call Jeff K before it actually went out to make sure that he and I were both clear on everything and that I understood everything well before it went.

I pull out six or seven water bottles with spray tops from under the blanket on my bed. There is a monster or some creature being created from dead leaves that collect in a swimming pool. The creature may be back from the dead. He/it is picking up a slice of watermelon that is lying on the ground next to a manhole cover on a busy city street. There is another man like him with him.",Negative
"Blue Van Wearing My Milton Hat  I'm at a party in Buckingham and I think there may be a few people with me. On the porch I see a kid form Middleton College named Joe that I met on case day. He is sitting with another guy. There are some people in the house, but they are leaving pretty soon. The party clears out, and I see a guy with a brown and yellow Milton hat on. I want to go get my hat, which is exactly the same. Or, is this my hat? They guy gets in a blue van. Down the road, I see the van is wearing my hat! I want my hat back!",Positive
"I take a new job as director of operations for a retail chain. I'm working for a woman. I go through orientation with her on my first day. When we finished I asked her if I could look at the operations manual. She tells me where I can find it. When I go to get it I see an accordion file. In each of the pockets of the file there are one or more stenographer notebooks. I pull one out, open it up, and look at it. It is a notebook from 20 years ago. It has notes that I had written from the store visits. Each of the pockets represents one of the districts that I used to visit at work with. I can't believe that she still has those, that they are still there, that I found them. As I'm reading through some of them I realize that there are also personal notes in them. Even then I had the tendency to write personal notes into whatever notebook I had with me wherever I was or what ever I was doing. Then, when I would get home, I would go through my notes and copy the personal notes on to another document. I went to my supervisor and told her that I found these. I don't know if I intended to ask for or if I actually did ask her if I can have those notebooks. I couldn't imagine why they would still want them or need them after all these years. I didn't want to tell her that there was personal information in them.",Negative
"A friend and I are playing in the street near one of those deep street excavations that Cleveland Illuminating Co. makes to install cable. It is covered by a complex of tangle and wooden structure and is of infinite depth. I am not too anxious to climb on this wooden frame but feel as though I must or lose the admiration of my friend. (I have no idea who he is.) As I climb around I realize that one false move and I'm cooked. Sure enough, I slip and almost fall into the dark depths but something, somewhere, somehow, saves me. I remember feeling a sensation in my genitals as I am about to fall (falling actually does produce a sensation as does most motion through space). It is accompanied by a vacuum feeling in the throat.",Negative
"I have just purchased a large quantity of meat. There is so much that it fills a pillow case. I shove the meat-filled pillow case into the freezer compartment of my frigidaire. It is so large a quantity that I had to force it into the freezer and had trouble closing the freezer door. The phone rings and I answer it. While I'm on the phone, I can see two older women at the other end of the line. They begin the conversation by asking me to guess who they are. I am irritated by this, but remain polite and tell them I don't know. They identify themselves as aunts, or relatives, of Mary. I still don't recognize them. The women then tell me that the purpose of their call is to tell me to quit ""harping"" on Mary's illness -- to quit talking to her about illness. I am very puzzled by their remarks because in this dream I don't know whether Mary is dead or alive.",Negative
"I was at the airport with Sam, my ex. He was outside in the cold while I tried to get some change. I wanted to get a cookie. I then went outside and drove off in a white Caddy with Sam. My brother was in the back seat. We got to a Jacuzzi spot and took off all our clothes. Sam looked so scrawny, but had a big dick. I wasn't attracted to him any more and thought of Donald.",Positive
"There were three levels of something, in a big communistic sort of setup, also perhaps 1984ish. The top level was on the surface of this town, a sort of hick town; the second level housed mainly a cafeteria and also was concerned with information; the bottom level had all sorts of more subtle jobs and was where I wanted to be, because I wanted to get help to overthrow or change the whole setup of the place which I didn't like. The government forces were mainly concentrated in the top level, if I remember. I was being sent to the second level to replace a worker there, and had a cared for identification. The type of thing that was done there was that people sat around reading all sorts of books and copying them for use throughout the whole community (and censoring them, undoubtedly). This seemed like the height of stupidity and uselessness to me, which was probably another reason why I wanted to go down to the third level and try to find some way to get out.",Negative
"Highway To Windton  I'm riding in my dad's gray car. My friend Niles Zelling is driving, and my friend Tim Zelling is in the back seat. We're going to Windton. Niles drives fast: over 90 miles per hour. We stop very abruptly at an intersection where we turn onto a highway. Tim and I comment on this stop, which was too jerky. I look at the map and try to figure out how long it will take to get there. There are mileage and time markers on the map between cities. They indicate the trip will be well over three hours. I don't think this is too accurate for us. By looking at the distances between cities that are familiar to me, I estimate it will take about one hour and 45 minutes. The first town we'll go through is named Norton or Horton. On the map, the road becomes a one-way highway to Windton. There is no returning road: it is Highway 15, in Montana.",Negative
"I was starting school and that things had really, really changed. We were in this auditorium that kind of put me in mind of a cross between the Hayes High School auditorium and the gym at Bancroft Middle School. The seats were not just slanted a little bit, but they were like way slanted like bleachers are. And they were different colors like in the Hayes High School auditorium, but there was this big, wide open space down in front of the seats that they said for assemblies and stuff they set up a stage. And I had the notion that for chorus class there was going to be this male performer opera singer going to teach it, and for some reason I had the notion that he wasn't as good, that he was very basic. And I reasoned in my head that the more advanced classes were going to be taught by Mrs. Dougherty, but that this man was going to teach kind of the introductory and beginning and basic classes. And I can't remember too much, so I woke up.",Positive
"I had this dream that Mrs. Carter and I were sitting on these chairs that were in the clouds and tilted all over the place.

"Simon's Quest  I'm in Mexico, in a place that feels like Cancun. I'm walking with five men to a movie theatre to see a movie about the Congo. I get a bottle of Snapple taken away from me. The theatre attendant squishes all of us into one row. The movie is about a man named Simon and his ghosts. The scene is a mountain. Simon and his crew climb the mountain, and are confronted by the ghosts. The ghosts are familiar fears. Simon's crew dies. He conquers his fears at the top of the mountain. A woman with a whip-like bungee is the last to be conquered.",Negative
"I was in my hometown in the back yard of a house I lived in when I was 10-12 years old. But it started on the college campus where my father attended--rolling lawns like open country. We were chasing a horse that was loose. We chased it into the back yard under a big pecan tree. People showed up, some I knew, others like gypsies in painted caravans and old cars. They started building a fence from scrap lumber--new and yellow-gold, but not matching. It grew like a Spanish fan or peacock tail. ""It is movable so the horse can get new grass within the fence each day."" The ground so lumpy like old furrows covered with new grass. Suddenly I was in a house sitting on the floor, and a young woman in white blouse and tight jeans sat beside me. I put my hands on her hips. She moved and another took her place. She had red hair and freckles and was about 20. I quietly admired her clothes, hair and skin. And she quietly lifted her sweatshirt-sweater and rubbed her lovely freckled breasts. She rubbed the nipple between her finger and thumb. In the dream I assumed it was modesty, covering the nipple. But it was also sexy stimulation--both opposites joined.",Negative
"I was driving on the freeway, which was different. I was going 70km/h so I changed lanes and sped up. I was approaching the tunnel and there was a cop with a sign. I realised he was doing breath tests so I stopped. I said to this lady, who was smoking, 'excuse me, I don't know if I was supposed to stop'. She said 'me neither'. I saw everyone behind me stop too. Elijah was there. It was then my turn for the test and they had to give you a needle that went between your hand and arm. I didn't want to do it. They also tested your heart rate. Phoebe and Monica (both from Friends) were there and Phoebe was pregnant. Phoebe got into a bed and I saw water on the floor and I said 'did you spill a drink or did your water break?'. It turned out her water had broken and I got Monica and we went to take her to hospital. At one point Ezra had my phone and he said he looked at my photos and I yelled 'DON'T!' as I was worried I had naked weight loss photos on there. He said Nana looked too and saw pictures of Joey and Chandler from Friends and I was like 'so what?'.",Negative
"Dreamt that while we were away WALLY has cleaned all the floors spic and span and put down light blue linoleum in the bathroom. He also fixed up a room for himself and paneled the walls with narrow tongue-in-groove boards. I am amazed and very pleased. Only Reynaldo is critical and sulks for a while, then OK. He said, Wally might have driven a nail into a pipe and it could leak, but I tell him to wait and see what happens",Negative

It's a parade at the time of Fascist Italy and the Duce himself is at the head of the parade, proudly marching, his look straight, his forehead is high; his uniform is yellow with black and very shining boots and straps. What calls my attention the most is his totally bald head which shines brightly from the sun's reflection.",Positive
"Dreamt last night of trying to sell my books back.  The store was a warehouse and there were some issues.  A fire alarm went off.  Then about before I left I asked if they had any Ondar CDs.  To my surprise, they did.  I was looking at the selection the old man handed me.  I decided to come back later to look at it since they were closing.  I believe it was this old man who partook in the second part of my dream, which seemed almost as if I were in my obnoxious roommate Chelsea's pledge class, I suppose.  The old man told us (there were 3, possibly Chelsea and my quiet roommate Sally) to grab all our stuff, no second trips (and we had tons of stuff) and go up the narrow staircase to a sort of attic.  There was a rail down the middle, and the right side was blocked with presents.  I headed up the left side despite the fact that the man was coming down with an armload of presents; he was dictatorial and didn't expect me to do something to hinder him.  Indeed, I normally wouldn't have, but I didn't like the treatment we were getting.  So I did not let him down but continued up the stairs.  There were racks of books, like chip racks in a convenience store or gas mart.  I was put in the back room.  Two glass panels were angled blocking off part of a screen that led into the dark of the backyard, I suppose, with a bit of grass and then a drop.  To the left was a fan, and I was putting my stuff on the right side.  I think Bob, my psych TA was there watching me, assistant to the old guy.  The old man came in and gave me more orders.  I was getting pissed off.  I started arguing up in his face, and backed him into the first room where the other two girls were.  The issue was something of a war, and he expected us to fight even though we had nothing to do with it.  I was yelling in his face, and he would argue back.  I got so mad I actually pushed him backwards, knocking him and a rack of books over.  With tears in my eyes I stormed back into my 'prison'.",Negative

"Scene laid in my hometown. On a previous visit to Hardys I thoughtfully left certain articles of clothing, including my coat, and go back to get them. On entering their backyard I remember that Mleanie is now in the house and I hesitate to knock on the door, partly because of a reluctance to disturb them, and partly because I feel my presence would be unwelcome. So I wander about, thinking that, in case any of the Hardys come out and ask me why I didn't walk in, I can explain that I was on my way to the pond nearby, which I wished to examine, and merely passed through the yard as a short cut to the pond. By this time I find myself in the front yard, and notice a couple of short clothes lines, with drying clothes, on the front porch. A lady, probably Grace Hardy (though I do not see her face distinctly), is watering potted plants on the same porch with the clothes lines. she wears a neat brownish, polkadot housedress. she glances at me, without speaking, though I clearly sense that her attitude toward me is a friendly one. The front walk is very different from what it was formerly, being closer to the house and also now having 2 curved branches, one from the north, the other from the south, which merge into the walk leading up to the house. There is a similar arrangement leading to the curb.",Negative

A man dressed in Robin hood-like clothes (ordinary clothes, not a priest's robe) comes under the tree with me. It is the man I love who has given up the priesthood. I stare at him, knowing on the unconscious level it is he. He moves tree branches like he's closing the curtains on a window for privacy.

"Ezra and I were going to watch a movie on Foxtel. Michael Emerson was tied up in chains and Terry O'Quinn was standing behind him. Something was possessing them. I found it amusing that Ben and Locke from Lost were both in it. The picture was going weird because the cord was falling out. Then I, except I was now Dana Walsh (24) and it was from my past, was on a computer. I was inside it first and Cole (24) came and he needed some pictures. I had stuff that would give away the fact I was a bad guy, but I had to transfer them. I blew into the machine to clean it. There were a bunch of short films. One was about a plant guy. They said I had to describe it without using certain parts of him, basically all of him. I showed it to Mom and she didn't know how to do it either.

"I think it was Matthew and I moving back to Lakeland Dr. I think I went to the owners of the home we used to own there and asked them if I could go in and look around. We went in and I was amazed at all the changes. They had gotten rid of the laundry room and the large deck we had built on the back. They had also put in a basement. I don't know how you add a basement to an existing house. For some reason the neighbors didn't want to accept me. the neighborhood seemed very nice, just as it was in waking life. At another point it seemed like it was very rundown and dangerous. At another point in seemed almost cartoonish in things that were in the street etc. At another point I was either a part of family that lived there or maybe a friend or simply an observer. The adult male in the family was prone to violence. The family members often tried to avoid him or hide from him when they felt he was dangerous. For some reason I didn't shy away from him. I seemed to be the one that was able to manage him and help him through his anger without hurting anyone.",Negative
"A woman is in the passenger side of a car. She has lied and said she lives in this huge blue house. So the driver takes her to the house and is waiting to see how she'll handle this. The woman stalls for time but the driver waits, knowing she lied. Finally, a woman in the house notices the car and goes out to see what's going on. She thinks someone 's come to visit her. She says hello. The woman in the car brazens it out and gets out of the car and goes into the house with her as though they knew each other. Now we're inside and I'm the woman in the car. The woman of the house puts me to work. I start doing dishes and she tells me to make a casserole for dinner. I ask for a recipe and she says, ""Just do the usual, use three groups of food."" I decide it is necessary to do this work for pay for her hospitality. I don't like it much. Ellie and possibly Charla are there and I'm annoyed that she's not doing her share of the work. Now Hank comes in. I bring food into the living room to serve the guests and clean up. Hank is being uppity and ridiculing me. I get angry and slap him in the face several times.

It is thick and too much syrup, but very, very sweet. I say, ""Yeah, I know. I'm not sure why I'm going either. Howard won't be there until late, so I'll be alone. I don't like the people there. They are so correct and so judgmental all the time. I kind of like to do things differently, my own way just to annoy them, but it is tiring hearing their point of view all the time. MAYBE I'll FLIRT WITH THIS CUTE MAN I know. After all I've already got the dress.""

"I am sharing a room with four other people - Aunt Elaine, Uncle Benjamin, me and one other woman. It is confusing at first who all is supposed to be in this room. Aunt Elaine says there are three beds, so three of us can stay. Uncle Bus leaves. At first I only see one bed, but I decide to believe on faith that there are three. I turn and see two more single pink beds on the far wall. I also see two more sliding doors, and through a crack I see more beds, one with a plaid coverlet, and I see the movement of someone's knees and realize someone else has that room. I see a door that could lead to a bathroom. We are at a sort of retreat and we each have to take a turn at cleaning up after a meal. The food isn't very good and Aunt and I decide (her suggestion) we go to town to have dinner. I think about the added expense and the waste, but agree. I am now looking through a book. It has some pictures of young boys and men. The other woman likes one of the pictures and wonders who it is. I look through to see if I can find more information. I see the name Hans Solo.

So I was very confident. Then I saw my mother come in with a whip, telling me the fault I had committed, and in spite of my denials, she gave me a whipping, and I don't know what I did because I don't' remember any more.

"I was at school. This lady decided to take us for a drive while dropping Elijah off at his house. Bradley and Theodore were also in the car. After she dropped Elijah off, she asked if I wanted to go home so I told her to go behind North Midvale and she thought it was far away. Bradley went to sleep with his head on my arm, I tried to move it but decided to leave him, so I tried to take a photo but I couldn't position my phone properly. She went to drop Theodore off and made me, Bradley and some people go in. She made this girl called Alice, who was then me, pretend to be a scientist and Bradley went off to be an assistant. There was a balloon outside this classroom. The building was round and so just outside the classroom was a round outside area where the balloon was. These people were supposed to tell me what colour it went by doing certain things to this thing inside. It went green by leaving it and smelled bad. It went yellow/gold with these things in little cardboard boxes. This girl burnt the next one which screwed it up and we had to start again. I then left, but got lost. I found this colourful little playground and I took a photo of it. I then tried to find my way out. Eventually I ended up back at the playground and noticed a gigantic one next to it. Jamison had his head through a hole in the playground. I thought we had been there before. It had a cool waterslide. We all kept going on it and Dad and Ezra were there too. Then I was there with the school. There were photos of us. Bradley was acting weird and supposedly liked me. I couldn't find my shoes. I had taken them off at one point. I asked a lady if she had seen them. Then I had no shirt on. This person had my Beatles shirt so I put it on while I sat on some stairs. I went to the place again at a later time and got a locker.

"This dream started out sort of confused. I was with this group of people and we were walking somewhere. It was not exactly a procession, but it was somewhat. I gathered some grass and some twigs. We were going to the big church. It seems that these people I was with were Catholics, and we were going to some sort of religious ceremony. We were going to this particular church because there were some Zulus there. And somehow it was important that they had something or other that we were supposed to get to use in our ceremony, and just as we got up to the church, this group of people found out they weren't Negroes, but they were dressed in these skinny orange costumes. We went into the church and there weren't any pews or anything. One person who is the leader had the little incense burner. She was sitting front of the rest of us who were lined up against the wall. I thought this was sort of a funny group of religious people and none of them were particularly religious, and I didn't understand what the ceremony was about. And about this time somebody came in. It was the husband of one of the people in the group, and they said they had some work to do. And then I saw that there was a microscope and a typewriter set up on a table over in a corner of the church. And so everybody said, well, they would go out then if this person had to do the work. Then I was doing the work. I used to work for the University School Library and it seemed I was doing some work for them again. I was typing up cards for the catalogs. There was one card that I was supposed to type up and I kept making mistakes. I couldn't ever type what you have to type. These things have to be just exactly so, and I couldn't copy it right.

When the show was over, the man I was waiting for came over to the last aisle in the back where I was sitting, and we started out. Then the girl came out too and I congratulated her on her exquisite performance. She looked less happy than she had on the stage, and I felt guilty about that because I was going out with my friend and she was not. There was a bench in back of us and on it was a cake that had been made for her. I think I made it, but I'm not certain.",Positive

"I was communicating with someone about catalyst. I saw communicating because I don't know if it was by phone or email or on catalyst.

"I come into a restaurant with my ""family"" - there's not many people here - it's small and cozy - we've been here before - I have a small bag with me, I think it's awkward to be bringing it in here, especially since I've also got another small suitcase that's old-looking, with a stripe and a makeshift handle on the end rather than in the middle. We sit at a small table and start a conversation with the waiter. There's some disagreement here but not major - I'm the one going somewhere to stay, like, say, I was going to gramma's for the summer - so I feel odd man out. The waiter brings wine - for some reason it's an incredibly expensive bottle (like on the TV show I saw last night) and it wasn't exactly bought - maybe a gift - maybe this is an anniversary dinner for ""Mom"" and ""Dad"". I remark on the new arrangement of the tables - different sizes, even, from the last time we were here - now all little round ones scattered around. They think I'm wrong but I know where we sat last time. There's an interval and ""Dad"" and ""little brother"" go somewhere - I'm talking to ""Mom"", who's sitting on a couch - I decide this is a moment that calls for the wine, so I pour 2 glasses - one for her, one for him - I don't want any. I take it to her, saying I thought this was the moment for an incredibly, (something, something) - even embarrassingly - expensive - glass of wine. She's surprised at first, very dubious as to whether to drink it, it's so expensive. I'm thinking, what are you going to do with it?",Negative

"I had a job interview at Bunnings. It was different. I had to shake hands with heaps of people and then shake fingers. A lady gave me a uniform and I accidentally dropped some keys into a chute, but they didn't go all the way down. On my first day, I forgot the uniform and she just gave me a spare. She got me to sit at a closed register and said to read 'mobile network' books. Elijah was there as a customer, but then he was working on the front counter and said ""I just had Bob Dylan [as a customer]"" and everyone was like 'What? Why didn't you say anything?'. Mom made fun of the uniform. It was a darkish green and the shirt was quite stiff and the shorts were short.",Positive
"We were in a small country town, small population.  My boyfriend Jeremy and I were staying in a place owned by an old couple.  We were cuddling in their bed, and then I walked out of the room.  Their son who was on his way to the bathroom appeared much older now approached me and warned that his parents knew what we'd been doing and didn't approve.  I told him we hadn't done anything but cuddle.  I was still a virgin.  We were waiting, and certainly wouldn't dream of doing anything on someone else's bed, especially to someone so hospitable towards us.  They said how could I be a virgin when I was pregnant?  I looked in the mirror.  I was blonde, and very pregnant.  Then Jeremy had to go to the emergency room.  Something had happened and his hand was bleeding.  The couple then became more sympathetic to me and in the yard the wife started showing me a photo album of her husband's.  I went through part of town trying to get to visit Jeremy in the hospital.  The town was covered the way I could picture a little Italian Villa.  After that a man was showing me the factories in the area, helping me to find a job.  Toys R Us.  Then I was in a car, and a fire drill.  I crouched on the floor mat while parked in a large parking lot at one of the factories.",Positive
"A scary dream.  Entering a dark worn down house with someone.  It was laid out similar to our house.  There was something about a Legend of Falsity, that if you don't believe in it, the evil will be real.  I believed, but I saw something moving in the shadows, coming toward me.  I woke up a little shaken but felt better when I put Sol's arm over me.",Positive
"A performance.  My friend Jenna was next to me in the bleachers.  We were supposed to be singing.  Someone in back was playing a didgeridoo.  Few people were participating, clapping their hands and singing. Someone suggested that we cycle through the crowd- they'd have to participate if they were singled out to lead.  So it started, and it worked.  Then people started leaving, and all of a sudden the multipurpose room was gone.  I thought about running the track, but it would have gotten in the way.

"I was driving in my car, from the backseat. I was having trouble seeing. I'm driving too fast. At the last minute I see that there has been a terrible accident and I see that there's all kinds of emergency vehicles. I slam on my brakes and I swerve way off the road. I'm trying to avoid hitting all of these vehicles. I'm expecting these emergency workers to get really angry with me. But it was almost as if no one even noticed because they were so busy taking care of the accident. I went ahead and tried to drive around the vehicles. I did drive around some of the vehicles that were parked there. I got around them. I think I backtracked. I had a very deja vu feeling to it. while I was still in the dream. I felt that I had either been there and done that before or maybe the feeling that I had dreamt it before.",Negative
I am tired and decide to go into Ginny and Ernie's bedroom. I lie down in the big double bed. The door opens and Rigo comes in and gets into bed on the other (left) side of me. I am uncomfortable. I then open my eyes and look around to see that now this is Rigo's bedroom. He has a group of miniature furniture and objects he either makes or collects. I ask him if they are the 1:12 ratio. I then see most are not. They are cute and I admire them. Ernie comes in. I am thinking I should get up and go lie down in Ginny and Ernie's room. I am very tired and unwilling to move.,Negative

This room was very dilapidated and messy. I then awoke.",Positive

"I'm in the sea swimming. It is shallow and beautifully clear, somewhere warm and tropical. With me is my friend Ralph. We are there to try to catch fish. The fish we are trying to catch look like clown fish - the orange and white ones. There are shoals of them which we round up easily, and then we pick them out of the water with our hands. Eventually we have a bagful. We walk along the shore and find a row of houses on the beach. Perhaps we are in Japan, because these houses seem to be made of paper with many square or rectangular panels, some of which are doors. Some people that Ralph knows lives in one of the houses. We head towards the house, but first we run into an old university friend Jackie. She lives a few houses away apparently.

"Dreamt of Sam Beckett at a party.  Was testing the caterer.  There were many dips for tasting, but they all tasted pretty much all the same.  In driving around the block of something, I saw a newlywed couple.  I was trying to figure out who the bad person was.  I saw people walk by.  My dorm floor mate Jupo with a halo of intricate spider webs above his head.  Sam and Al were talking alone, in the middle of a dispute.  Sam held me down for inspection, with one hand on my left breast.  "" And down there's why"", he said.  Finally he pulled my shirt up to reveal a blue-hoofed creature- a tattoo on the left side of my stomach.  That was the sign they wanted.  The caterer was the bad one.  I was then sitting in the passenger side of a car.  The caterer started cutting a grid into the windshield, cackling.  I screamed, and was now Sam.  I tried to climb into the seat behind, but it was reclined too far.  I managed to grab her left arm and hold her there, but she still cut my right hand as I struggled for control.  The cut went into my pinky, stopped partway by the nail.  Finally got her.",Negative

"I went to my first job with my supervisor shirt and it was for a company that made shampoo made from poo. It was in little test tube things and was like round bunny port but smaller. On the ingredients thing it mid it had something to do with dragons and some exotic creature. Apparently it smelled like poo and didn't clean that well but it was popular. It was the only thing they sold. There were quite a few people on the job and they were all supervisors. Hector and Esther were there. Esther told everyone to mark their names off the job sheet, so I did. Niles turned up and had a supervisor shirt on as well and I was really annoyed, thinking 'this was supposed to be my thing!'. I had a jacket on, so I thought at least when I took that off it'd rub it in his face too [note: This actually came true; I turned up with my supervisor shirt on, feeling smug about it when Niles turned up in a supervisor shirt too].",Negative

"My boyfriend Jeremy and I had a second, black refrigerator in the apartment.  I was looking inside trying to condense everything into one.  There were some slimy fish things in there, and I was disgusted.  We designated the black fridge as Jeremy's for his seafood products.  He pulled out some frozen starfish, supposedly his favorite.  Then we were at my parents.  My mother was fixing something to eat.  In the freezer I saw a box with a picture of bug-eyed flatworms.  On the counter were bowls with food- maybe creamed corn in them.  I asked which was mine, and put something else in the middle.  My mother said, ""no, it has to be cooked first, take it out.""  I tried but it wasn't going to work.  Then I was on a tour with a small group of people.  We went into a small room; it looked something like a sauna.  There was a panel on the floor and a large man jumped on it.  We went through the passage it created.  Our tour guide below took us down an aisle of what looked like a store.  He handed out things like an orange and a stretchy doll.  There was also a truncated cone in pink, with lace.  The foam rubber material was nearly everywhere.  At the end of the aisle we were in were some supposed condoms in syringes.  I rounded the corner and talked to the tour guide, a tall, blue creature- an alien.  I asked him whether he would recommend one of the ones they had, or if I should stick to human condoms - I didn't know how different alien condoms were.  He said to try the ""salman kashie.""

I called out to Darren ""someone's in the respiratory system"" and he was like 'go away'. They said like ""shit!"". Darren refused to believe me and Mom encouraged him to believe me. Then he got up but the guys were long gone. I said I would never joke about that, ever. There was a movie with Kevin Kline and he and a bunch of others were like spies or something. Their names depended on where they did stuff, eg, Ms Solomon and some guy ended with ""aizal"". Some others called Beason and Eastland. Kevin liked this girl called Izzy. I was annoyed at how Americans say my name. His black friend said he should ask her out. It was The Big Chill like. Then James Van Der Beek and a friend were at a table. He liked the guy (he was gay), but he was young and I said ""what is he, 12?"". Then it was a movie and there were zombies. We were in a room and at first there was only one zombie but then there were heaps. I called the guy down and I was in like a storage section of a food shop and said to bring weapons like brooms, but he got killed.

I can't remember what they wanted me to do, but I had to get next to him in a cinema. There was an old guy next to him and lots of old people were in the cinema. He got up to pee and we giggled and I went over. He had a big hat and I took it and put it on. Then I gave it back. It went over his eyes and he had another floppy hat on which held it in place.

At this dinner were several of my classmates from Mather. I remember seeing an elderly woman there who was in my Spanish class. We conversed in several minutes and then I heard my mother asking me what the score of the Ohio State game was. I couldn't remember the score, but I said someone made along run.

"I was driving into a store parking lot and parked my car into a handicapped space right next to a black truck. There were two people inside the truck. One of the people was a male and the other one was female. The girl seemed to be in her early adolescence. After I parked I got out of the car, and then turned around. I see the two people who were in the truck get out of the truck and open the passenger side door to my car and get into my car. The guy was behind the driver's seat and the girl was in the passenger seat, just as they were in the truck. Then I opened the driver's side front door and yanked the guy out of my seat. I was extremely angry that someone would invade my space. I then locked my door and the girl locked her door so the guy couldn't get back in, and I knew then that I could trust her. Then when we drove out of the parking lot, I could see the guy she was with chasing us and with him was another male chasing us. The newest male was the girl's boyfriend. So these two guys chased us throughout my dream. I felt they were going to rape us, but I wasn't scared because they didn't seem like much of a threat. Then the girl and I came to a bridge. I was looking at the lake below the bridge and I was thinking that I would rather jump off the bridge and risk the fall rather than being caught by these two guys. The fall made me think of the one Harrison Ford took from a storm drain in the movie, ""The Fugitive."" All of a sudden it started to rain and the bridge was filling with water and I was wading through it. I felt like I was going in slow motion and was worried that these guys could catch up to me more quickly. There were a lot of people surrounding me, sailing boats and relaxing. Then the first guy I encountered came up to me and grabbed me so I wouldn't jump off the bridge. He said not to worry, that he wouldn't hurt me. Someone had hired him to chase me so that I would have some adventure in my life.",Negative

The guy was there with his facial hair shaved off. We were in a car and the other guy was in the back and he gave himself up and looked scared. Beckett and Castle had to go somewhere later and she gave me the report and asked me to see if I could find out how they saved it. There was a picture of a clothes rack and dress? I went to Alexis and asked if it was because the dresses weren't on the clothes rack and she said yeah. She seemed shaken by the case. We were staying at the old house. Mom and Darren were there and asleep. Alexis had a nightmare about a guy standing at the door. I told her it was safe and that I'd had a similar nightmare.

"I had to leave a gathering of several M-- acquaintances at which we were seated around a table singing. I had to take part in a Valentine's Day program to be given at my former elementary school. The girls handed me what they thought was my coat, and then another, and then another until they finally came to mine. I remember that all of the coats were dark green although they differed in style. Arriving at the school I asked one of the children how to get on the stage and he directed me. I know I had a costume, but I don't remember it except for a Mexican blouse, and I don't remember my part, The face and name of the Master of Ceremonies kept changing, but he was always the same person. A professor of psychology whose course I took in another university walked down the aisle from the audience with his notes under his arm. He walked to a magazine rack which was at one side of the stage and picked up different magazines, all of which had a cover design depicting winter and snow flurries, sleighs, etc., and one of which was titled the Philadelphia Story. He then walked to the Master of Ceremonies, they kissed, and he took over the remainder of the program. Interpretation The only phase of this dream I can possibly interpret is my part in a program and the Mexican blouse as part of the costume. I did a Mexican dance in a program given at the university from which I transferred. I cannot explain anything else. Answers to questions 2. No particular emotion.3. Participant4. Pleasant5. No6.

The pictures were still, but moving. The leaf would hesitate and then sway, as if to fall from the tree or open up majestically. In the locker room was the project on movement. One thing they showed was a baby hooked up to an I.V. of blood. The baby had unhooked itself, though it needed blood. The baby needed the blood from its mother, but the mother had AIDS, so getting the blood would be slow sure death. So the baby had unhooked its own arm from the I.V. and walked away. Disappeared. Eileen noted this and explained and passed around the leaf pictures. The big pictures were still. It was the tiny square insert of the leaf that moved and twirled on its own--even though frozen in still paper and not moving at all. ??? (ILLEGIBLE) It was almost time to start. Tom Brandon was there dancing. He had on a red plaid shirt. We ??? but it was almost ??? Me and Rudy were photographing strange shadows on the wall. Shadows of ladders that came from nowhere--went to nowhere. The major installation was waiting, and walls for this piece would show something else when we looked on. The art didn't look so good. I kept looking at the book, wondering how Eileen had made the still leaf turn. A band was loading up and playing roller blades.",Negative
"G. and I seemed to be sharing a sleeping room. Walking about there one morning, I noticed an offensive odor, and set out to find the source. I soon traced it to a table on which lay magazines and papers. Lifting several of these, I found a crumpled sheet of wrapping paper, and under this, in turn, an amputated arm, seemingly a child's. It was noticeable decomposing at the cut end. I took G. to task for leaving it there, but so far as I recall my feeling the annoyance was no stronger than I should have experienced if the paper had covered the untidy remains of a meal.",Negative
"I dreamt I was a pilot on an aircraft carrier and was assigned to fly a new experimental jet plane. I took off and flew the plane, but when I started to land the plane my speed was too great, and I overshot the deck. The plane crashed into the sea. As the plane was about to crash, I was transposed to the deck of the carrier. The body was compressed into a jet tube. However I didn't recognize the body as my own. I was then told that as a result of my death as the pilot for some reason or other I was told that I'd have to become senior medical officer on the ship.",Positive

"In this dream I was out of doors looking at a huge river and I was standing somewhere above the river and I could see a vast expanse of dry cracked mud between the fork of the river. I wanted to go swimming in one of the forks of the river, but couldn't decide in which one. The next thing I remember I was standing on the sand at the shore's edge. I ran, plunged into the river and swam out to a buoy. It seems I had picked the far fork or branch of the river in which to swim. I was with other people in the water, but am unable to remember anything about them (sex, age, etc.).",Negative

I shorten it to 1/2 hour and tell him how if he plays games with us and waits us out, it will go bad at the trial. He will have proven his guilt.

What he doesn't know is that I and the other woman are psychic and are taking notes on his internal responses and we know the whole story.",Negative
"My mother said, ""Who left this toaster on? You almost burned it up!"" She knew it was me. In the kitchen was a little boy who was playing the cereal game with boxes of cereal that he threw down from the cabinet when he climbed up on the counter. He was singing a song that he made up about Raisin Bran and Sugar Smacks. He started crying that all the boxes were empty. So I was sitting on the floor and I picked up Cheerios that had spilled on the floor and the big empty Cheerios box, and I bit a cheerio and I said, ""See, it's stale anyway,"" (to try and make him feel better) but it was not stale at all.

"I pick up a Life magazine from about 1954 and it has picture of William Cowper Brann, a ""man hated when alive because he was an iconoclast, but now honored in his home town, his home a memorial."" Suddenly, I was in Arizona near Frank Lloyd Wright's ""Talisen West"" and in the desert I see a white mother cat with four little white cats following her. She goes up hill to a big house and I enter and it is home of Brann himself, and he is surrounded by four boys, his students. On the mantle are several volumes he and the boys have written, ""Flora and Fauna of the Arizona Desert."" I look at one of them and I open it and Brann comes up and stands by me and touches my penis thru my clothes, and I wonder if he's a homosexual. And I wonder how far I should let him go, so I can read his amazing and useful books.",Negative
"Then I saw Mr. K. and asked him to help me hang my pictures. He thought two others ought to be moved to make better balance. There were many pictures on a long, low wall. The hangers were sticky tape that peeled off and yet stuck again when the pictures were moved, but those on one picture were wearing out so I cut some off from an extra long piece on another picture. When Mr. K. finished and all the pictures were hung, I started off to take the bus. I walked along over a gravelly waste.",Negative
"I joined a group on Facebook for FilmForum and it had less than 10 members. Raquel and Leif were friends on Facebook. I wondered who she was on FilmForum and thought she was Mary Rose for a second, but then remembered she wouldn't have seen more films than me. There was something being filmed outside. I had a microphone that was like a flat map and I realised the person hadn't filmed lots of things. There was a kid on some rocks near the water being interviewed. There was a zoo which a mouse creature. I had a big lamington and it kept grabbing at it. It had a long nose and was weird looking. I was then with Mom and I finally got to the and ate the lamington. I offered some to Mom and she said 'ew, lamington' and I offered her more and then remembered she didn't like them. I ate half and then gave her the rest.",Negative

He says it's the latest, best model and opens a luggage case and pulls out the stamps, money and tickets. I comment that I am 45 minutes late. He says there's a $32.50 charge for the use of these materials. I am surprised and not pleased. He changed it to $3.50. I don't check it out. I need the stuff, so I decide I settle up with him later. I go and see lots of people going into the dance. I say, ""I've got the tickets,"" but no one buys. I go in and announce they can buy their tickets now, but still they ignore me. I also see a sailor go by the table and I become aware that he stole my money.",Negative
"Under a dark night sky, I am sitting outdoors at a large, popular music concert with a group of friends. The seats are the overly soft, somewhat worn, but very comfortable chairs that are found in many old movie theaters. My friends and I are all sitting in the same row listening to the music, which is very loud and is being perfomed by the ""Mammas and Pappas"". Their song intoxicates the entire audience. One row in front of us some people stand up and sit down to form a ""wave"". This wave is carried everywhere and I feel the chair I am sitting in rhythmically rise and fall every few seconds, as if it were floating on a sea with real waves of great height. This is a pleasurable thrill, a joyous release, and I am ecstatically carried away in the motion of the chair, the loud music, and the happiness of everyone around me. This physical high lasts for quite a while.",Negative
Working with someone on an SAID document related to the sponsor program. It had already been created. I was redoing it. The original had included a bunch of pages with numbers from some kind of survey results. It only had a couple of items on each page.

I see a tiny car with odd wheels that flop around in a strange circular motion like it's swimming. It goes past. Then I hesitate and say, ""We can't go this way."" The woman is talking about her novel and her ex-husband and a platform. I say testily, ""I'm tired of hearing about your ex-husband and the platform (sort of a novel she wrote).""

Sue and I are the only two students in the room. We get assigned to do our choice of odd or even problems from the book. The teacher didn't instruct us on how to do them, just to do them. We are having a class meeting on Wednesday, and the problems are due Friday. Sue and I look at the problems. She is wearing a short gray cotton skirt with a pair of white spandex biker shorts underneath. I wish she wouldn't have worn the spandex under her skirt! The problems in the book have boxes with circles in them. Depending on where the boxes and circles are, they are symbols for addition and multiplication. Sue and I flirt, and I want to kiss her.

"I was shopping in a large department store. I was looking for something very definite, but I wasn't sure of where it was, or what it was. I had to go to another floor, but I was afraid to get on the escalator because it was going so fast. Finally I steeled myself and forced myself to get aboard the conveyance. I was terrified going up at this break-neck speed. Finally I reached the floor above only to find that what I wanted was in reality downstairs. I was distressed at having to go down again, and confused by the milling crowds. Finally, I managed to get away from the crowd back into a deserted dingy corner where a dingy elevator was. I waited for it to come up with some misgivings, because I recalled similar experiences, from other dream situations, in which the elevator fell or went down too fast and made my stomach feel awful. But I had to get downstairs, and this elevator seemed the only way at the moment. I got in when it came and had the same feeling of inexplainable terror as we descended. It did go too fast, but it didn't fall completely out of control as I had feared, and on the whole wasn't half so bad as I'd anticipated. I felt relieved when I got out. Interpretation This dream, in slightly varying form of detail, has recurred to me at increasingly lengthening intervals ever since I can remember. At times, especially when I was younger, it was my mother I was looking for, and I was terrified because I was lost and separated from her. At other times, we were together, and I was afraid of the escalator or the elevator. I can't think of any reason for these dreams unless it is an insecurity I have always felt in my home life. I'm not sure, but it may be that I have this dream after my parents have had a serious argument. Answers to questions 2. Terrified, anxious, frustrated, a hurried, almost hunted feeling3.

Soon I realized that my cheek was becoming hard and knew I had the disease and would have to be shut up. My leg also became hard in one spot. The people said that I would have to be shut up, but they would try to put me in a nice vault. I felt resigned, but didn't want to be so distorted. The inside of the vault wasn't too bad, and I sat and waited until I became as sick as the other people there, but somehow I wasn't afraid.",Negative

"I was at Nana's, which was different. There was a big room full of beds. Outside that room was a shop thing. The aisles had horror posters, puzzles etc. There was a Child's Play one and a haunted house one. It spoke to me (it had an audio thing). I went to bed. It was dark in there as people were already sleeping. Nana and Poppa were in a bed. Dad and Ezra were in another. I said to Ezra later that instead of building one big bedroom, I should've them and a shop separately. We were clearing out movies. We had heaps missing including The Langoliers and The Happening and others. I found Ezra and he said he didn't take them, so I was looking for Dad to ask him. I went into a computer shop to look for him. I left and realized I needed to go back (we owned it and Dad had stuff there?). I was walking outside and I saw Turk (Scrubs) walking below.

I was outside, and this group came out too. One of the people was Ezra and a really a fat kid. They attacked me and I was hitting them with a water bottle. I asked Ezra why he was with them. I said the girl was bad and that boys could do things (in poker and stuff and the girls would 'whip you'). Ezra dropped his Pokemon Diamond [though he has Pearl] through gaps in this bridge.

"Mike and Johnny were over. They had to leave and Mike asked if he could take my car to the train station. I said sure even though his car was at my house too. Right after he left I realized...""what the fuck - why did he take my car?"" The train station wasn't very far away. I ran to catch up. Right when I got there the train was just about to pull out of the station. It was an old black choo choo - like a miniature version. I jumped on and sat next to Mike. I figured I would get off at the next stop. I asked around what the next stop was but everyone around me was quiet and didn't really answer. I found out that it was an express train to New York. Shit! I couldn't get off. My environment seemed to change so that I was still in the train but now it was more like I was on an amusement park ride - I wasn't necessarily in a cabin but more of a single seat. I could view what I was approaching right in front of me. The train is going along on the tracks over a cool bridge. I could see nothing underneath the bridge. We traveled on a straight strip of track and I saw a handicapped person either on crutches or a wheelchair in the middle of the tracks. We were about to hit him but the train swerved right around him and off the tracks.  From then on we were on a road going through another state. The trees were bright yellow with foliage. The road became very swerving and hilly much like a rollercoaster. I felt my stomach jumping as the train dipped and swerved in the dips and bumps. Then we are on straight ground - going through a really close tunnel of yellow leaves with sunlight pouring through the branches in rays. We're headed right toward a closed door all decorated with strings of rubber ducks. Close and closer - about to smash into the door. Right when we are about to hit - it jerks open and we move into the hallway of a house. I can hear a little girl pissing on a potty throught the cracked open door of the bathroom. There are small orange pylon cones on the linoleum floor of the hallway. i guess that these are there as markers so that the little girl doesn't walk in the way of the trains. The train at this point is pretty much not a train anymore but I have the feeling that I'm on a moving chair sort of like a ride through the 'Haunted House' at Disneyland that I went on when I was about 3. Down the hallway towards the open kitchen door, the chair jerks and turns down a small hallway toward a closed narrow door. Once again the door opens just as reach it and it is a bathroom. I think to myself how awful it must be to live in this house and what a pain it would be to have commuter trains passing though your bathroom when you're trying to get ready in the morning. Not to mention taking a shower or going to the bathroom. I find out that the train is actually going to make a stop in the house so I decide to get off rather than continue to New York. So there I am, in the entryway of this suburban house. A girl walks in. Some parents ask her ""Where's Marcia?"". ""I dont know - she's gone out"" says the girl. I go out the front door. There, on the lawn, are about 4-5 big black cars - chunky ones - Mercedes, BMW's with tinted windows. In the street there is a moving van. There is a family of Italians all dressed in black walking up the front steps and mulling around. I remember them from the train. They had been really quiet and took up a lot of the cabin. It appears as if they are about to move in to this house although I dont think the people inside are aware of this.  Different tangent: I am sending a package of things to Kenya. i am trying to pack the stuff in one of my mothers klong jars. But I realize that this doesn't make sense because it is so heavy to send and plus it's my mom's plant potter.  My mom, dad, and I go shopping to the mall to buy plastic storage containers for packing. In the mall entrance, there is nothing around but stairwells going down. The entryway is very bare. I look down the stairwells but don't see any stores or even people. My mom directs us to the right stair case. At the bottom there is a sign painted on the wall and an arrow ""Shopping - 6 minutes"". We walk down this empty underground hallway for a long time. Finally stores. I buy a plastic bin and a bikini. There is an exit from the mall to a beach. The actual shoreline however is only about 10 feet across and lined up for miles is a single row of fold-up beach chairs. All the chairs are occupied with people. We get some though. The water is very stagnant - no waves and only a few people are swimming. I catch a glimpse of my mother opening a freezer on the beach and pulling out 3 large clear garbage bags of frozen raviolis - one meat, one vegetable and one sausage. I comment to the girl next to me that I highly recommend the ravioli - they're very good. My sister keeps on making fun of my new bikini. The elastic is all stretched and the bottom keeps going up my ass. [Mike and Johnny = friends]",Negative
"I was back in high school and in some kind of sewing class. Peggy B from SDI was in this class as well. I think we had finished one semester and had returned to start the next semester.

But this semester, whenever anyone was paired with her they didn't really have to do their part of the project. The project was sewing. The first week I was paired with Peggy B. She was making a duvet I believe. At the same time I was paired with a man that I remember from high school. His name was Tom A. I had gone to find him to tell him my idea that resulted from the situation with Peggy B. I found him in the library and he was sitting there with Mike Ke working on something.

"The first part of this dream is indistinct, but then I remember that I and a group of people were in front of this tunnel carved into the side of this mountain. A small tunnel, just say 3 or 4 feet high, which led back into the mountain. And a little tiny railroad car of some sort was supposed to go back there. There was also a little wire that ran overhead. And we were going into the mountain, a sort of a sight-seeing tour because there were several things of interest inside it that we would want to see. So we all got into these little baskets which were suspended from this wire that ran along the ceiling, and were carried along, and stopped at one or two places that I don't quite remember. And then we were going to see the zoology and chemistry sections. And we asked this woman how to get there. And she was busy, but finally she opened this door which showed this steep, narrow flight of stairs leading downward, and said that we would go this way. So we started down the stairs, and I was in the lead, and there were innumerable flights of stairs, one after another, going down into this mountain. And we started going faster and faster, and sort of swinging along and jumping over the stairs and going farther and farther down. And finally we came to a level where there was a zoology lab section which was just finishing up. And so we decided we'd ask these people exactly where the exhibits or whatever were. And so we went into the lab. There were people putting up the animals they were dissecting, which were some rather strange sorts of animals. It wasn't a fetal pig, but I guess it was closer to that than to anything. And when we told the instructor what we were looking for, he asked one of the students to show us the dissection he had been doing. And so he opened up this animal, and all the parts inside were just, they had been, it seemed they had been detached and weren't in their proper places, and were just floating around. It really didn't look like what you would see inside an animal at all, and we were talking about this and discussing it, and that's all I remember of the dream.",Negative

I'm going to masturbate lying on the bed. The phone rings. I go to pick it up. It's Hilary Nano's mother. My friend Simon Naver picks up the phone from the basement. He's either really drunk or stoned. I think he's hung over. I tell Simon that he's at my house, that this is Kenneth (speaking). He hangs up. Hilary's mother is worried and asks where she is. I tell her they left a while ago, and Hilary should be home in a couple hours. The other phone lines keep ringing. I hear them in the basement, and keep clicking over to answer the calls. It's my sister Heather or her friends. They're distracting me from talking to Hilary's mother. When I click back, Hilary's brother says hi. They are worried about her.",Negative
"I was staying away somewhere, like in these cabins but we weren't supposed to go out after dark or something and keep our doors locked. I think there was something dangerous going on, but I'm not sure. There were 4 girls (including myself) and 4 guys. One of them was kind of hot and we kept catching each other's eye. We flirted for a bit and then ended up having sex, but it was a little bit rapey. We kept having sex though. I posted a vague post on the forum that I'd had sex with someone but shouldn't have and the posts were all 'helpful advice' type of posts, but saying like 'if it's consensual sex then it's ok', and they hadn't really gotten the gist that it was only partly consensual. Benjamin posted my FilmForum activity and like 'how can you fit anything else in when you're working 44 hours a week and watching this many films' but it was only like 1 film a week. Something happened and someone else and I were outside somewhere (during the day), not sure what was going on, and there was a pond thing with passports in it. I joked that we were actually dead and these are our passports. They were our passports and she freaked out like 'how did you know' and I said it was a guess 'you know how many movies I've seen, this happens all the time'. Everyone had then forgotten their memory (except for me), but no-one really knew and we all bundled into this room and sat at this long table - girls on one side, guys on the other. I still found myself attracted to the guy from before and I caught him staring at me again. I wondered if he'd still be the same as before.",Negative
"I had the most vivid series of dreams last night. First, I was at Tony's house watching some play or game show of sorts about the history of his family. His brother and sister were there, and I realized he also had another younger sister. The odd thing was that is family seemed a lot like mine --they were really close and played games together and it was very cute. Then I was in a car pulling out of the driveway, and I realized his house was in this steep, mountainous landscape that I have seen in other dreams as well. Then I had a really gross image of having a gigantic pimple on my cheek. I poked it and the white pus/goo just leaked out in a shiny, white, subcutaneous glob.",Negative

"I was in a house. It was either my aunt's house or my uncle's house. I think it was my mother's house. We were having a Christmas party, and we were all sitting around drinking wine. There were several little bottles of wine around. Some of them had green tin foil on the ends and some had pink tin foil on the ends. I think they were Paul Masson, and the wines kind of ran out and nobody got high or anything. I guess you can't get high unless you really try. I went in the kitchen and my uncle was out in the kitchen. This is an uncle I'm very close to, and I was making some coffee, instant coffee. The coffee was already moist, and I put it in the cup and it wasn't mixing very well. There were little clumps of coffee that hadn't dissolved in hot water. Then I was stirring it, and he said, ""Here, let me stir mine,"" and he was stirring his. That was when I woke up.

I wanted to do it though. There was this cool skeleton outfit. I was trying to decide what to buy. I was calling out across the shop. I found these school bags and one had lots of pockets. There were also these REALLY big bags. I was looking for a wallet. I found these people who did something and they were evil or something.

Tim Brunero was there and he said that I was ""allowed anything"" from outside the shop. They were packing it away and then he turned into Mandy Patinkin. There was a cool jumper and a cool raincoat thing. Mandy put on the jumper and I was like ""Yeah, I want that one!"".

I was walking down a very nice street in C--. The houses on it were attractive and there was an air of middle-class substantialness about them. I noticed the pretty lawns and trees lining the walk. As I was in the market for a house I decided to buy one of them. But suddenly I noticed railroad tracks to my left and the atmosphere seemed to change. I looked over to where the houses had been and then everything seemed to recede in the distance. There were hills and little buildings and winding paths.

Lea Michele was one of them and introduced herself as Rachel Berry and shook the kidnapper's hands. Then Mom and I were at a newsagency. They used calculators. A song called 1756 was playing. The guy accidentally gave us a $100 note which had been meant for the people behind us. It was yellow. We left without realizing though. We were walking away and we realized they were following us. We went through the Northtown McDonald's carpark (different) and down the road and this path up ahead was forest-like. We walked through the park and there were these big black plastic forks and I grabbed one. We ended up also walking through a school. We got to an office and David Bowie was behind the desk and he had calculator like mine. Ezra tasted it and it was actually cream.

We stopped in a spot near a stream eventually and I was on my guard. He said, ""I would punch your partner and then hit you one and it would be over."" I said, ""Don't fool yourself. When you would be hitting my partner, I would be on guard as I always am.""

I gave her a tough answer and sister Ann was there with Mitzie. Ann gave me a sarcastic answer. I bawled her out, told her she had a big mouth like and worse than her sister Mary. I ordered her off my porch. She went off, but came back and got a handful of silverware, including a bread knife, and held it above her head threatening me. She was a big, husky woman, taller than I. I took all the silver out of her hand and she picked up more. I was kind of afraid of her. I saw a movie of a man sitting on a large scale. He had a pile of cabbage and lettuce. He talked and then ate the cabbage. I had a head of cabbage and ate it. Arnold came by and said, ""If I had a chance like you, I would make good use of it."" I told him I did. I ate. I saw a small boy run across the street in front of a car. Three women walked down the street. Mickey M. wanted to take me as a prisoner.

"I was in a store kind of like a Wal-Mart or Target. I was standing at a magazine rack going through loose pages of the yellow pages looking for information about exercise equipment. Twice clerks came up to me and pointed out there exercise equipment but I told them I was looking for something very specific. I think I was looking for something like the ab roller that I use at the Y. I started to walk away and I walked by this counter. There was a man and two women there. The two women were making a strawberry milkshake. I saw one put a scoop of vanilla ice cream into the blender. I said, Now that's what I'm looking for. They said, do you really want it? I said sure. But I had to find a glass to put it in. I told them to hold on a second, that I would go get my other one. I went to get it but it had chocolate all over the inside. I went to grab something else, it was a blender beaker as well, but it had chocolate in it too. I told them I would just go to the refreshment counter and get a cup from them. They said, You're going to buy one for that? I said I would if they wouldn't just give me one. The next thing I know, though, I am standing at the refreshment counter with the shake in an actual glass. I pick up a lid, though it doesn't snap onto the glass and I stick a straw through the lid and I leave. As I was leaving the store I noticed a penny on the cement. I was happy as I always am to find a penny and said the Our Father as I always do when I find a penny. But as I bent over to pick it up I saw another one. When I reached for it I realized there was a lot of change on the sidewalk right there. So I started picking it all up and putting in the pockets of my jacket. My jacket was white knit so the change in the pockets pulled it down a lot in front. Some of the change was in piles and had 50 cent pieces and silver dollars and quarters in it. I was so excited to find all this change. An elderly, gray-haired lady walked by and said something to me but I don't remember what she said.

The best way I can describe it is four large white banners that formed a square, leaving a large opening in the middle. Each section had rectangular pictures or graphics every so many inches. However, there were places that there was supposed to be a graphic and there was not. It was the job of the group to select a graphic for those empty spaces and put one in. We had a number of different options for selecting graphics. I suggested to the group that we choose one of those options and stay with it, as it would help us to be more effective. We could reach group consensus on each graphic more easily and we would be able to accomplish the task on time.",Positive

The computer was still working though and it was still running, except there was a small strip across the top of the screen which was just black. I went into Ezra's room, which was finished and it hadn't been burnt at all. Then there was this white kitten and it kept lighting the front lawn on fire. I kept putting them out and eventually caught it. Then I was at home and Ezra was setting fires there. Simba ran past, on fire, and I poured water on him and it wasn't enough to put the fire out and so I got more. Where the water had gone, was now invisible. Ezra and Dad decided to put these two kittens, including the white one, and a duck toy in the dryer to kill them because they were lighting fires. I was trying to convince them not to because it was mean. I felt bad so I took them out of the dryer. I was then at a park, going for my walk.

I mean you couldn't possibly do it this way. Anyway the sodium was outside and the potassium was inside. To get an action potential, the membrane, I think in this case it must have been a skull which was depolarized and sodium flowed inside. The potassium flowed outside. When I kept thinking, every time I thought was the sodium flowing inside and the potassium flowing outside, I was thinking this was kind of a screwy situation because we really can't measure this and we're measuring it this way.

"I with 2 or 3 others are looking for my lost golf ball. The immediate vicinity is of very uneven topography, and one of the searchers suggest that the ball may .... large ditch. This, however, seems very unlikely, as the caddie had a good line on the ball -- the line being obtained by sighting along 2 trees, one large and one small -- and according to this the ball should be about where we are looking. As we kick around through the grass and stones we find old golf balls by the scores, nearly all of them lopsided, badly cut, or without covers and not worth keeping. Chester does find 2 or brand new ones, and I decide to pocket a few to knock off into the woods. One short steep slope is thickly studded with a combination of golf balls and round white stones which can scarcely be told from golf balls until one gets down on his hands and knees and examines them intently. Finally I drop another ball which trickles over a small rise, and then starts rapidly rolling down a long hill. Faster and faster it goes but, when nearly out of sight, it suddenly plops into a hole which seems to be full of something black, perhaps mud. I carefully mark the hole.",Negative

So I said ""goodnight"" and they all sat down on different couches and chairs and I saw that they were all settled in and I gave it a little bit of thought and, this is about 9:30 at night, I remember seeing the light was on in the living room and I remember the TV was on, I could hear the TV, I could hear them all taking their positions and after a bit more thought I said that I was going to bed because I was tired and I went back to my old room, where I used to sleep and I saw J's pajamas and I moved them, put them somewhere else, I don't remember where. Then I took my guide dog in my room, and for a minute I couldn't remember if I had taken her out at 9:00. Then I remembered that they were doing some kind of construction work in the back yard and I was wondering if it was okay to go out there and I could hear bulldozers and stuff. Then I remembered that I had taken her out but I also thought that if I hadn't I would have taken her out in the front yard. The back wasn't such a good idea because they were doing some kind of digging. I patted her and felt her soft fur and said goodnight to her and lay down and went to bed.",Negative
"I am at a place which looks like the Great Sand Dunes National Monument. I am with my husband and other people, mostly men, are there.

"In daylight, I am with a group of people walking along a road or trail. It is as if we are refugees. I walk next to a woman who is old and smelly, who has a heart condition. I do not want to be near her and move on. We finally arrive at our destination. At a picnic table I sit with a young boy who is looking through a thick book about war. He is reading the section about Vietnam. I look at the pictures with him. Several NV A soldiers have dragged two dead GI's into a street and are castrating them. Then the images become real, and we are caught up in an NV A attack. It is dark and difficult to see and they are over running our position. I hear screaming and bullets and a grenade explodes near me. Moments later an NV A comes over the berm and bayonets me. I wake up.",Negative
"Paying $29 For Gas  I'm in a Food-n-Fuel gas station. I get $12 in gas and buy a bag of cheddar cheese chips. The bag is small and flat, and costs 99 cents. At the counter the cashier rings up my total of $29! I am furious! All I got was gas, chips, and a bottle of water. It should be no more than $15. The cashier says that someone has to pay for it. Reluctantly, I pay for it, and I tell the cashier that I want to see the manager. This person says that the manager won't be in until tomorrow at 11:30 am. I am thoroughly disgusted. I go outside. There are two or three of my friends with me. We sit. A black police officer comes and talks to us. He empathizes with us. [Note: I needed to get gas today. Today is the 29th of July].",Negative
"Immature Cheer For Beer  I'm attending an Honor Society meeting in a church. I'm there alone, outside a room. I feel hesitant, like a dork, since I'm there alone. I go in. There are many young people there. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor is there sitting next to our other classmate Eric Stoner. My junior high classmate Tara Gosling is there. There is food and Grain Belt Premium Beer. People are all sitting around on the floor and on chairs. The Premium looks to be gone. I find a bottle of it. I open the bottle and it starts to foam over, so I suck the foam up. I can't suck all the foam, and some overflows onto a white plastic bag. Two younger men are hiding beers in their pockets. I scold them: there is not enough to go around. They seem immature and overly ambitious to drink. I sit on the floor in front of the chairs. My friends from Brimson Emerald Reinhold, Holly Lapson, and Terry Foss walk by. I say hi to them, with my usual degree of discomfort in their presence. The meeting starts. The president of the Honor Society is a nutty man! He is a physically small man with long straight brown hair. He tells bad jokes. He talks bout hanging black hair. Three black men who are in the audience mock the president for what he says, as if he knows nothing. The president says something about black hair being a mole's vagina. There is a white woman with blond hair in the back of the room. I know she is there. She is a leader of some sort: someone with power. I try to look mature when she can see me. I don't want to seem immature in front of her. I have lost my beer. It may be somewhere but I can't find it, or I decide which one it is from the others on the table. A couple of people run up to the front of the room with beer. As they hold a box, a tear it open and grab a beer. It is a big can of Heineken. I crack it open and drink a lot, though I don't slam it. There is an Asian man there who wants me to share my beer with him. I let out a loud cheer for the beer, and feel immature for doing so.",Negative
"I'm a river animal of some sort and I'm lazily paddling in my nice creek. I see fish swimming, my dinner later on. I smile, floating on my back and feeling good about my nice river. I get out and explore a commercial restaurant kitchen. I waddle up some stairs and see a double swinging glass door to the lobby. I am tempted to go through, but remember that the last time I did that I couldn't find my way back, so I return to my creek. Kitchen people comment on me as I pass, ""Did you see that? Wasn't it cute?"" ""Someone should pick it up."" ""Not me!"" I see three or four more poodle dogs in a side alcove. A man says, ""They're mine. I'm waiting for the other sexed dog to arrive.""

"A puppy like mine and another puppy (tan, cuddly, and small). I pick them up because they almost get run over. Then I put them down so they can run away. A man watches. The puppies turn into cats.

"Dream I had while my wife was rubbing my head, and we were talking. And I was falling in and out of sleep with little dreamlets. And at this one point I fell asleep, and in the little dreamlet, I had just come into a room which was full of electronic gadgets of some sort, and I then proceeded to pull a whole bunch of connectors which cut off all messages coming into the room, and then I was going to get involved in something else, and my wife woke me up, by asking me if I'd fallen asleep. Sort of symbolically indicating that I'd gone to sleep and cut off sensory input. That's all.",Negative
"I met my future husband last night. His name is Sal [unknown in waking life]. I had my laptop sitting on my bedside table and it was connected to the internet. I started chatting with him online, though I don't know who contacted who or how we found each other. Online he called himself Sal CEO. Our first interactions were fun and playful. Within a few hours he had arrived at my house to meet me. He is fairly tall, has reddish brown short hair, wears glasses and medium build. He is a very nice man, and fun to be with. I was sharing a home with Darren and with Maureen U from the sleep center. They were married and lived primarily on the first floor of this home. Sal and I wanted some time alone to get to know each other but he was very nice about the fact that Darren and Maureen U were there. They were each dealing with some kind of problem in their life, each separately, and he was being very kind in allowing me to do what I needed to do for them. We were both engaging in conversation with each of them about whatever it was they were each dealing with. He noticed a bumper pool table across the room and suggested we play. I told him I didn't know how and he would have to teach me. I went over to the table and realized that there was a piece missing or something and told him we couldn't play because of this. He suggested another game that the four of us could play. We were preparing to do that. I noticed how dirty the tile floor was. It was covered in black footprints. I said something to Darren and Maureen U about it, almost scolding them, telling them that they could be a bit more conscientious about taking care of my home since I had agreed to let them stay there temporarily. I lived primarily upstairs while they were staying here, but shared some rooms of this floor. That's why Sal and I were down there instead of going upstairs. While we were getting ready to play this game Sal and I found ourselves alone in a room for a few seconds and he gave me a quick kiss on the lips. I could tell by the look in his eyes that he was going to do that before he did. It was nice. It was especially nice because it affirmed to me that he was enjoying being with me.",Positive
"I saw two men jump off a high cliff so they would own their homes in a better home as they were going down feet first. Then one turned and landed on his side. I could see the blood come out on the ground as they landed dead. The other one, as he jumped, his feet hit the side of the cliff and he landed on his side and also was killed. I said, ÒIÕm going to live in my simple house and am not going to jump.Ó I came over to George Gotches. He was going to bed. I drove two spikes into broom handle sticks and he was going to sleep. I moved the spikes over to make room for me. The brothers and sisters of George were small like I used to see them when I was a kid. Grandma had a baby lying in bed sleeping. The baby was lying in water that it was submerged under. Its nose would come above and it would breathe. A rowdy Slovak boy came into a building and got tough. I went after him. He ran away, but his gang got up and I had to clean up some of them. I later found the rowdy and I collared him. He was afraid. I punched him in the nose and then I saw people sitting around and there was some kind of liquid going thru tubes and thru them. We had a large schoolroom. The paper was hanging loose and I got hold of a long strip and it was loose. Martha O. was walking up the stairs and there was a caster on the step and I told her to watch herself.",Negative

"The first dream that I remember concerned an experiment with butterflies which have a bad taste to birds, supposedly, and the imitators that really taste good imitate the noxious ones so that the birds won't eat them either. And in this experiment they had used hawks and presented these butterflies to them, and it was very quickly found that after having tasted a couple of the noxious ones, they wouldn't try to eat the ones that were their imitators either. So this experiment had been done and then for some reason they wanted to see if these butterflies really tasted good or bad, and so they had this med student be presented, not exactly be presented with, but eat a couple of these butterflies. And the one that tasted bad was really terrible, and he was real distressed about, and he couldn't quite understand why he was in the experiment. And so I told him all about the details of the other experiments to sort of comfort him, I guess, and then I rubbed his head for him because that made him feel better. The idea for it was from the magazine that's put out by the Museum of Natural History in New York, had this article in it about frogs being presented with the harmful insects like bumblebees and then with their harmless imitators, and how quickly they learned not to take either one of them.",Negative

We went around some very nice places and suddenly we were dancing in a night club. The name of it, ""The Bug,"" was very much impressed on me.

"A beautiful woman is married to a powerful man. But she is in love with a Cary Grant kind of guy who is her husband's business right hand man.

Her trusty older woman advisor (secretary?) warns her to be careful. She is devoured by her attraction to Cary. Cary is equally devoted to her. They go off to a house. The king has spies and they are lurking around. Now there is a baby as well. The spies, soldiers, are searching for the baby. The wife realizes she's in danger and so is the baby. She must flee.

"Previously: I'm on a little balcony or outside upstairs walkway, and there's a place that I'm assuming is some kind of shop. There are things to look at, anyway, and it's all old-timey, maybe antiques, with lace doilies on things. I'm looking through a basket of picture-cards, like big postcards, and come upon one that shows a woman (all dressed quite properly for 1890 or so) on a funny kind of exercise bike, that is built on a nice upholstered chair. It certainly is quaint and funny-looking but as I think about it I think you could actually do that after all. I set it down again and mention to the woman I'm with what I saw, that she'd be interested, she ought to have a look at it. (I don't know who she is, but she's older than me; also standing on a higher level of the floor here, a step or two up from my part of the shop, and by a railing that divides the sections.)

"I seemed to be eating lunch in E---- hall, however, the dining room looked more like a club room. After dinner it was announced that everyone had to leave because a chemistry group was going to have a meeting there. A man with red hair called off a list of names of new veteran students who were invited to remain. One on the list was a girl. During lunch, before the meeting, one of the boys was talking about the immoral practices of the army nurses overseas. I was glad I could say that I hadn't been overseas.

"The Projection Of My Shadow  I'm on a farm with two men my age that may be my friends. The farm has the layout of the Redding farm. The barn is there. We approach a group of birds. We're hunting the birds east of the barn near the big hay shed. I slow as we get closer so I can load my .22 caliber rifle and fire early at the birds, which are crows. Most of the crows fly away. I'm on the second level of the barn. We're planning on shooting some of the birds from the small door opening. I load the clip for my .22. The bullets I have gotten are from my old housemate in New South Wales. Some of the bullets are too thick or too long for the clip. I load three or four rounds into the clip. We're going to shoot crows, owls, and other birds. My friend Kevin Simpson is there. A large brown owl is just outside the barn door opening. Kevin grabs it and kills it with his hands and a screwdriver. I have verbally prompted him to do this. There is a man that sees us. He is outside the barn standing a ways off, in the direction of the birds. He yells at us for intending to, or actually killing, the birds. He reminds me of David Hale from the University of Wellington. He has long brown hair. He starts up towards the bran to confront us. We need to flee. I tell the two others to go ahead: I'll catch up. I may say this so I have time to fire a shot and still get away. We flee. We go through the barn on different levels, in stair and corners. I climb in the rafters of one level to hide in a place that I think is a good spot. I lay flat in the rafters. There is a light bulb below me attached to the underside of the rafters. I see my shadow projected onto the floor, even though it should be on the ceiling considering the position of the bulb and myself. I must move, so that when the man comes in to look for us he doesn't see my shadow on the floor. In the route we take as we flee there is a dead grandma lying on the floor.

"Last night I had a series of weird dreams. First, Sydney and I were in our room and we were part of some game show with some of our friends and other random people I don't remember. Every time we got a question right, we took shots of vodka together. Mario was there too and kept warning us to be careful. Later, I was in Adam's with Sydney, Jillian, and Reese. We were trying to decide when we should go get sushi for dinner. I think it was after final exams, because I was running on a treadmill in Adam's, and didn't have a care in the world. Next, there was some sort of funeral or memorial. All the boys on the hockey team were wearing the same team tie, and had to recite a piece of a eulogy for this person who had died. I remember seeing Trevor and saying something about him to my father. He told me that Trevor wasn't his real last name; rather it was ""Sierra"" and he just went by Trevor because it sounded manlier. Although I was shocked, I think I knew this. I felt out of place that I did not have this blue silk team tie, or the equivalent, and I also wondered why I was at this memorial, since I didn't seem to know who had died. Next I was in a building in Manhattan somewhere. I had ordered pizza and the delivery guy was doing a dance outside my window. A-Wall was there too. We were hunting around in our garden (inside the apartment) looking for a plant that would in ten years grow to be my husband. Then I woke up.",Negative

"This first dream takes a little bit of explanation. It was about the neighbors in the apartment next to ours and he is Mexican. He's about 32 and she's from Ohio, around 25-years-old. He has a real bad temper and also has this idea that man is the very dominant one in the marriage and children should be seen and not heard. She is sort of strange because she never raises her voice when he's around, but when he's not there, she'll shout at the children herself. The dream I had seemed sort of ridiculous, but it was horrifying at the time. I dreamed that we didn't live in quite the apartment we live in now, more like one we lived in several years ago in which the bedroom was next to the apartment beside it. I was in bed at night fairly late and couldn't get to sleep. My husband was out somewhere and hadn't come home yet. This couple were going to leave the next day, she to go up to Illinois for a while and he was going to Mexico, which, in fact, is going to happen in a few days. All of a sudden I heard him shouting at her. I was sort of horrified and aghast because when he gets angry, he sounds as if he is going to kill somebody. He was chasing her around the apartment. I could hear because I could hear these footsteps. She was never raising her voice at him, sort of trying to pacify him the way you would a child or someone who is insane.

"I was with a prostitute who was about 25 or 30 years old. She was nude. I disrobed and displayed my body to her. She said that she didn't think I would be able to satisfy her. However, I was sure that I could do so, so I talked her into letting me try. We proceeded to have intercourse, even though she was still rather skeptical at first. I satisfied her and the dream ended with my having an orgasm.",Positive
"It was Christmas time and we were passing out Christmas presents. We had Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce and Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly and Grandma and Grandpa, and Grandpa was doing the passing. And Uncle Carl and Vince and Uncle Charlie were all little boys, and it was like it used to be. Carl got all kinds of nice things and the other two were real jealous. And before I knew it, somehow -- I don't remember unless we changed scenes -- like we were our family and we had all these little things in front of us, and then Dad said, ""I'm going to bring the presents out in a little bit,"" thinking that it was the big one. And I also dreamt that the magnifying machine in the dining room was a computer and that it was on and I had to hit control-alt-delete because something went really screwy, and then I remembered, and then I woke up.",Negative

"I'm in a house that's totally white like a hospital, but designed the way a house of the future would look like. I hear some doctors saying that they're about to administer the ""easy"" medication to my mom because she's going crazy or something. Now I'm running through the neighborhood of white houses. I keep running and running, jumping through the air and traveling really far. I'm bounding through the air, doing flips and back-handsprings, but I keep running. I'm holding a mop and use it to pole vault over walls and to aid in more acrobatic maneuvers. As I keep running, I begin to hear music, a sort of rock anthem, and soon enough, I find myself in the house I started in. I do a back flip and land on my back and am about to do a kick-up when on the ceiling I see a mirror and in the mirror is a cartoon woman (sort of looking like Louis from Family Guy). The figure starts to morph into all these different women I don't recognize and as the music gets louder, the figure in the mirror looks more and more like my mom. And as the song ends, I hear the doctors say, ""Time to administer the intermediate medication."" Then I wake up.",Negative
"Ezra, Jayson and I were trapped on this island. We hung out on the beach. We had boxes we'd made, boogie boards and That's Life!. The tide started coming in and we moved everything up and also put some stuff into a house like Nana's, but it had different furniture. Nana kept coming to the island in a little speedboat acting weird. There was something about shortcake sea water? Something broke and the water came to the house, then I was watching it as a movie and it was The Beatles, not us. They left the house and then the camera focused on Darren, and they were walking through a forest and they got shot at. Then it was the people from Lost. Jack and Kate were talking.",Negative

"My dream takes place in a big building which reminds me of the high school I went to. I'm taking somebody into court to sue them about something. I'm not sure what this something is, but it's a combination which shifts back and forth between something having to do with my car and something to do with my thesis data or something like that. The person I'm going to sue is apparently a friend of mine. His identity seems to shift back and forth between Dan Weld, a graduate student friend of mine about my age, and somebody else who I'm not sure who he is. While we're waiting for the trial, Dan and I or this other person -- I'll call him Lannie, although his identity isn't quite clear -- are going along upstairs in this building collecting grade reports or various letters from the teachers. We seem to pick these things up and put them in a little cart that runs along on a little wire up in the air, just a little thing, not more than a foot long at the most. This isn't too clear. Then Dan goes off for some reason, and I believe some friend of his keeps on with the job of picking up letters. In about 5 minutes I thought we had better go down because I thought the trial would be starting. So in a few minutes I go down to the courtroom, which is in the same building, and just as I reach the door, I hear the judge say something to the effect that since the plaintiff, that is me, didn't show up, that the whole thing was a mistrial. All these people come out of the door. Apparently all sorts of my friends were there. They were waiting to see this trial, and were disappointed I didn't show up. I'm both angry and disappointed because I had no idea that the trial was scheduled for earlier - for 9 in the morning, I think - I was coming around 9:30. So I wander around the halls with these various people, trying to find some of my friends or the judge or somebody to find out exactly what happened. I can't seem to find the judge. This theory gradually develops in my mind. I picked up an attitude from the various bits of information I gathered from these people milling around the halls, that my opponent in this case had planned this. He gave me the impression that the trial wasn't until later in the morning by working along with me upstairs. Meantime, a friend of his stayed there in the courtroom giving his side of the case, telling some lies about me, and filling up the time. Then he slipped away at the last minute while I was still collecting these grades, and went down to the courtroom and the judge declared it a mistrial since I hadn't shown up. I was going to go out of the building thru the front doors when I saw this guy who had taken up the time in court while I was upstairs. He admitted to be a fellow I had disliked in high school, and I have given him a rather vengeful glare and he laughed or said something. I called him a liar and I was kind of hoping he would get mad and want to fight or something, but he just went on by. So I went on out the building and I was looking for the judge's office. I looked around the buildings where I thought it was in the city where I go to graduate school , but I couldn't locate it, so I thought it was in the basement of the police station, or at least when I initially went to see him I had seen him in the basement of the police station. I went into the basement of the police station and just before I went in, there was a little box outside on the ground, a tall, thin box containing a bunch of rods, each of which at the top was a marker on indicating how some trial went. There was one there indicating that my case was a mistrial. So I went on in, and you were supposed to ask a policeman sitting at the desk there, or tell him your business or something, and there wasn't anyone there at the moment. So I waited a minute and then I knocked at another door leading on in the police station. Someone finally came, a policeman and a woman. The woman was apparently a secretary there or something like that, both of them somewhere between 20 and 30, I guess. I told them I wanted to see the judge, and they said he wasn't there right now. They weren't sure when he would be in. The woman turned out to be a friend of mine, but I can't think of who she was. I told them my theory about how I had been tricked into missing the trial. I believe that's the end of it. Another detail of it I recall was that this person in the courtroom who told all sorts of lies and things apparently talked about rapid eye movements and EEG stages and things like that too, said things about it which were just plain wrong. I thought that even though there were people in the audience who knew he was wrong, they couldn't testify or anything like that. At the end of the dream when I finish telling the girl and the policeman about my suspicions about how the trial came off, Dan came into the dream and I think I told him my suspicions. At this point, as Dan, he became differentiated from my opponent. He added something to the effect that some big cement factory or something like that across the river, during the trial, whistled several times.",Negative

"Macy F and I were on a business trip together with Vince P, Tim R from ITI, and a much younger male that I didn't know before this trip. Macy F, Vince P, Tim R, and I were sharing one large room. There was a partition, or a wall, that separated the men's beds from ours. The younger male had gotten a separate room for himself. We had been out somewhere and came back to the hotel. All five of us were in the larger room. All but the younger male were sitting on Vince P or Tim's bed talking. Macy F and I were sitting at the foot of the bed and they were sitting at the head of the bed. I was getting really tired and sleepy so I laid down, on my side, but tried to keep myself awake to continue to participate in the conversation. As we continued to talk, each of the others did the same thing. We were each stretched out. By alternating body positions, we all fit in the bed. Tim R had been drinking, quite a bit. He sat up and reached for another drink. Vince P was trying to stop him because he knew Tim R had already had too much. Tim R wouldn't give up the drink so Vince P got a glass of milk and was trying to get him to alternate between the alcohol and the milk. Apparently, this was a common occurrence with Tim R. When I realized that I wondered if that had anything to do with my feeling of discomfort with him since I met him. I hadn't been able to identify why he made me uncomfortable. Maybe it had something to do with this type of behavior. Macy F and I decided to go with the young man to his room to get away from Tim R. Just before we left the room Tim R went over to my bed and started vomiting all over my bed, over and over. Macy F left and went into the other man's room. Something sexual happened after going into his room.",Negative

"The first thing I recall in the dream is a group of people standing around the door leading into an apartment. The cause of the excitement was a jammed lock. There appeared to be a number of dollar bills jammed in the lock that prevented its proper functioning. I managed to extricate the bills and get the lock working again. The next thing I recall was a living room full of relatives discussing something, but I don't know what they were discussing now. The scene then shifted to a kitchen.

I asked the man I was with what that was all about. I don't remember what he said but I remember thinking that it was similar to the fact that Catholic women always used to wear something on their head when entering the church.

"It's a very rainy morning. It's one of the worst weather days I've seen since I've been here. But it's summer time and we all know what happens in the summer time, so I should starting expecting it, I guess. Last night I had a dream that I was back in Westport and it was Easter time, but for some reason it was real cold outside, as though it were winter, and we had to put on jackets before we went outside. And I think either Mom or Dad -- no, it was some guy that was our neighbor -- wanted to take our pictures out there while I was home, and so we had to bundle all up and go out there. There was a swing out there that was built like Grammy's, where there weren't chains hanging from a tree; they were just hanging from a little, teensy metal thing at your head level. And, you know, they had gardens and flowers and stuff, and eggs hidden in various places, and I don't understand why it was so cold, but the scenery looked like spring. And we had a baby chick running around, a bunny running around, you know, like we used to have rabbits galore, except this rabbit was crazy. It was a live, running around rabbit, but you would pet it, like you would pet its head and it would say something. Or you would pet its back and it would say something. And I had the notion that they genetically engineered it like that, and I kind of thought that was so wrong. I thought rabbits are supposed to be rabbits in their own little right, their own little creature, and their body language should convey what they mean. And we shouldn't go messing with them like that. But that was like off the wall, man! And I know there was so more to this dream; let me think a minute. The only other thing I can remember is that I think Sandra showed up somewhere in this, and I had like a big, flat briefcase full of my school papers that I was showing to this neighbor. One other thing that I should note here: the rabbit that was whacko was a white one, and it was the size and weight and everything of just a regular bunny running around, that you get at the pet store. And the baby chick was yellow. I don't know if that means anything, but I've heard that colors are very significant, so I thought that I would include that.",Negative

It was boring, so I really don't want to be back there, but I guess I keep thinking like I am.

"Samantha and Sandra and Derek and Jason were all in town, and Lee was there too. And I dreamt that there was sort of a new wave type of thing that the family was getting into, and it seemed like when any of them were together the only thing they could ever discuss and debate was how people should live if they are considered to be true Christians. And they would argue and debate over things, and one of the claims that one of them made was that you're never supposed to eat sheep meat, no matter what, that sheep are like the holiest symbol and you're never supposed to eat them. And it really isn't right to keep them in captivity, but a lot of people do. And I dreamt that there was this one lady that they talked about who would, you really weren't supposed to eat cat meat either, but she would like cut into the leg of her cat and take a little bit of meat off of him, and sew up the cut. Talk about gross! And the animal would live and she wouldn't want the neighbors to know that she was eating the meat of her cat, but she was, and the animal was still alive so it wasn't really obvious. And after all of that, I faded into another little scene that we were at a dock, at a boating ramp dock thing, and Dad was getting training through the Fire Department, along with some other guys, in how to drive these dinky little boats that would go fast one way and then would go really fast the other way in reverse. And I guess they were supposed to be used to look for people and stuff, but this boat was small enough that an adult person could lay down in the bottom of it and they would be touching either end of it with their head and their feet, almost a little bigger than a bathtub. So Mom and Dad were lounging back in the seat of this thing and they were going to start up the motor and start running around, and they got me in between them on board and it was sort of floating away from the dock, and they were going to start up the motor and start running it around and stuff. And I asked, ""Well, was it going to be as loud as the one we used to have?"" And they were like, ""Yeah."" So I sort of jumped out of the boat, which was really easy.

"I was on Skype with Benjamin and he changed his profile picture to one of him which he had taken with his laptop and at a low angle, with a weird smirk on his face and looked a bit different. Behind him was a cupboard/shelf thing with a few bits and pieces on it -- one of them was a trophy of a hand giving the finger. Later, the picture changed to a video in real time and I clicked on it trying to work out what was happening and it tried to video call him and I cancelled it. Then it changed to this film he had been in. It was set in older times with farmers. He was in those ratty farmer type clothes [Hobbit-like] and he was lying on the grass with one of those wheat things in his mouth talking about how great the day had been. There was a girl lying next to him. Then it was real life, but it was in the present and I was there. He was talking to these two girls and I kind of walked off, but he re-joined me. It was night. We walked for a bit and then I was suddenly in this long dark hall at the door. Benjamin was outside on the porch and knocked. I looked out this little slot in the side but saw there were these two ghosts. They were cartoonish but had armour and swords. He was fighting them off and I was too scared to let him in. I saw this furnace in the door and switched it on and they melted. I let him in, but it was pitch black inside and spooky. I found the light and then we went into this room and there were computers and computer parts everywhere, as well as books. At some point, I realised it was a dream and was looking at this shelf of books and noted how similar they all were -- they also all had the same title, but I've forgotten what it was.",Negative
"Last night I had a dream that I was taking an exam in the athletic center. Ian pulled me back and started flirting with me. I stroked his chest and then went to take my exam (what is my problem!?). Then I was in some huge house and it was all metal and connected to the athletic center. I had to go to a certain college, and my father was driving along a very precarious and windy road. I was watching him driving for some reason, when I think I was supposed to be in the car. We were on the golf course, on the 6th fairway. Then my brother woke me up this morning.",Negative
"I was in the pool with a snorkel mask, I think I took my pants off.  My friend Deanna was there.  I went inside the restaurant with someone and picked up two bottles of Jones soda.  I saw my best friend Emma on the way out.  I went to move the car and had some difficulty with control.  When we got back, I was hot and sweaty so I jumped in the pool again.  A cute boy approached me and we swam together for a little bit.  I had a sweater on for some reason.  We got pretty close in the water, though I don't think we ever kissed.  I don't know if someone then said something, but I realized it wasn't just a cute boy, it was my good online friend Del, and I felt sort of embarrassed.",Negative
I was a patient in a hospital. I was going to be released. I accidentally hit a young patient in the face. I was excused. Later I accidentally poked another patient in the face.

He is attracted to her as well as a spy and he starts to follow. She walks quickly down a hall and around a corner. She ducks into another room and shuts the door.

We had just moved into a new house. It was huge and lots of bedrooms. I was trying to decide which one I wanted. Mom and Darren were acting weird and looked upset. Mom said something and I didn't hear it so asked her to repeat it and she was like 'don't worry about it' but I asked again and she said she and Darren had decided to break up. Then she started crying. I went away and was annoyed and a bit upset because I was confused about what we would do since he paid all the bills.,Negative
"Many people including my family and friends were sitting on very comfortable chairs and couches in a huge, beautiful room with columns and pillars all around the room. Straight ahead was a section with steps leading up to a space occupied by a very long desk. Seated at the desk was a man dressed in a judges' robes. A friend turned to me and told me to notice that the man in the judges' robes was a fellow I was dating. Then at the other end of the room music started playing. This fellow in the judges' robes came down, stood directly in front of me and asked me to dance with him. Interpretation I think the courtroom scene came to me because I was reading about the acquittal of 28 men who were accused of lynching a Negro in the South. The pillars and columns were a result of my taking an art appreciation course and having to notice such things. The fellow I dated dressed as a judge seemed to represent the idea that actually he is the one who has to make the decision as to whether or not he wants me and his asking me to dance represents the marriage proposal which unconsciously I want, I think.

Some guy threatened to steal some lady's baby. They got the police over to the house and Zoe (Firefly) came for support.

I started to fall, but the chasm wasn't very wide and I managed to stop my fall by bracing my feet against one wall and my shoulders against the other. Then I looked down, and it seemed as though I could see down for at least a mile. At the bottom were a lot of tiny houses. I was terribly frightened, because I was growing tired and I knew I would soon fall. I woke up then, but every time I closed my eyes I could see that long drop.

"I live in an apartment which I apparently share with roomies. I am unhappy. Something has happened or I am wondering deeply what I should be doing with my life. I choose not to go to work or school or wherever I usually go on weekdays. I decide I need to drive to Dover, which means go visit Ginny. Bonnie comes in. I think maybe I'll go across the street and visit Derek, later. Bonnie and I go look for the kitchen. There are two complete kitchens next to each other. The back one is mine. I say to her, ""See, even if the roomies want to be cooking at the same time as us, we have our own kitchen."" Bonnie likes that. I tell her I'm going to Dover. She leaves. For some reason I am hesitating and not leaving. I don't really want to go to Dover or to visit Derek and I do want to all at the same time. Now the house is crowded with roomies in the living room and I wonder where I can go to be alone. I find a back bedroom and go in. At first it is small and has a couch or two, not very pleasant. I then see there is more to it and follow it back to a comfortable sitting room with burgundy flounce curtains and a stereo speaker system that makes the music sound grand. I sit; it is nice. Then I decide to go see Derek. Maybe it will help. But I also don't want to go. Mateo goes with me. We drive to his corner and We get out and I realize there is a window display I'd never seen before, bottles with colored water in them. I see now I'm not at Derek's house; I'm a block too soon, on 14th and Ferry, not 15th and Ferry Street. I feel a bit silly to have made this mistake.

"I was going to a fairgrounds when my two girl friends and I were notified that there was going to be a big show in the auditorium in a few minutes. We rushed to the auditorium and there we saw some old friends. I remember one very distinctly. He was a boy who went to high school with us. Now he goes to Harvard. In a Bostonian accent, I told this to my friends. They all smiled knowingly. I noticed that the Harvard boy was wearing a white tie and tails. He was a member of the local band. The show began and the announcer said that this was a special show with many acts. The first act was that three girls from the audience should come to the stage and each sit next to some boy and they would be married. It turned out that we were the three girls. I was the first one to walk down the aisle. I sat down next to a boy named Douglas and we were married. After the marriage, I left him and wondered if it were true. I then woke up. Interpretation I remember the two girls whom I was with mainly, I suppose, because I have been going around with them the most of any other girls here at school. I remember passing the boy's house and thinking that now he goes to Harvard and how far all of us have gone since high school. As far as the marriage was concerned, I had been to a wedding a few days before the dream. The dream might mean that I'm interested in marriage. This is only logical.

"I am asked to serve on an advisory commission in Washington, D. C. and be made an Honorary Member of Congress as part of some government program. I am flattered by the honor and I accept.

I am standing in a large hallway made entirely of marble when I recognize other people in my program walking about, seeming to know where they are going. I ask several of them for directions, and they answer with the names of departments that I have never heard of. ""How was the meeting this morning?"", I ask another. ""Oh, it was funny"", he answers, ""They did a show. But you didn't miss anything important."" I am still lost, but I get a copy of a map that says ""Federal Triangle"" on the cover. Inside is the layout of many of federal office buildings with each individual office marked. ""Wow, this is a useful map!"", I think to myself. Then it is time to make plans for the evening. I say, ""Should I stay here or go home?"" X.

"I was doing computer editing, creating and checking web links to other sites. It seems that it's a page, kind of a table of contents for a publication. This page has two entries from each section of the magazine and I think this page is just two issues. I'm working on it because I just recently discovered that there was a problem with them. There is another person involved in this, but somehow indirectly. There is some kind of physical implication for this other person, something that requires much effort for that person. It's as though I hear someone telling him, Come on. You can do this. I know it's hard, but you can overcome this. Look. Look. You're doing it.",Positive

"I dreamed I was preparing a meal for a large number of people. I recall seeing these people seated at a table in a large dining hall, yet I knew that they were in my home. I had the feeling that there were a great many people here, some of them strangers, yet I could only see a few familiar faces....most of them my family (mother, father, mother-in-law, sister-in-law). I then remember being in the kitchen getting ready to serve and some of the women had come in to help me. I remember dishing out noodles and soup into small bowls and serving them amidst a great deal of confusion. I then discovered to my dismay that I had not prepared enough food for everyone. I served the main course feeling very embarassed, but my sisters-in-law were assuring me that there was enough for everyone. Interpretation Two weeks ago I held a largee family dinner at my home. It was the first time I had ever prepared a meal for so many people at the same time. Although the affair was successful, I think this dream reveals some of the anxiety I had about it.

"I walk into a big hall where there's a pancake feed going on. I feel very good, walking so easily and without pain. I pick up a huge tray of pancakes only cooked on one side.

I ask my mother to bring me a glass of milk, explaining that I had thought there was one here already, but it seems someone removed it. Uncle Gus stutters and drools a little. Aunt Rosalie looks emotionally exhausted and nervous. Someone asks me if I'm really going to ask him about the incest stuff and I firmly nod my head yes. I look at him and ask, ""Tell me about it."" He is shaken, like a child and scared. He stutters that he only did it to Darcy as a baby once and then Rosalie explained to him how it was wrong. He didn't quite see how, since Darcy wanted it, but it must be so. I realized he was a broken and ill man, not capable of understanding his own culpability.

"I was with a group on an excursion thing at a place similar to Hillary's. Once I got in, I realized I had no money. There was a drinking fountain with cans on it, so I took a handful after a guy friend I was with urged me to. I bought a ticket with 50c pieces. Then we went to this thing for water. I gave a $2 coin to the lady and said 'that's $2 a night' and she looked at it and wondered. She saw that it had some Olympic thing on it and she asked where I got it. A tracking thing said it had last been used at their water fountain. I said I found it on the ground. She started questioning me and said I needed to go talk to someone about it, but I ran. They chased me and I climbed over a fence with those sharp circular things and got to my car. She chased me down the freeway, which was very busy and different.

"A short little dream during an hour's nap. The first thing I recall being aware of in this dream was being in a hallway. It was windowless. And I was aware to a very great extent of the fact that I was dreaming. And I was at a point at a stairway in the hallway where I could go up or down. When I started to go down these very bleak concrete stairs, I realized that going down these stairs probably represented symbolically a descent into my own unconscious mind. And this was somewhat frightening at the time because I thought I'd have to deal with all sorts of unconscious material that would be represented by monstrous creatures. And so I went down one flight, really questioning whether I should go, because I really didn't feel like dealing with these monstrous creatures right now. And on the other hand, I didn't just want to run away from them. And so after going down one level, I walked along a hallway a little bit, and started thinking about how I'd have to fight these monstrous creatures, and fantasized myself some weapons. First I thought of creating a sword for myself, and then thought that probably wouldn't be too effective against them. As along as I was going to create weapons, I would go all the way. So I fantasized a protective force field around myself to keep anything from getting thru to me, and a little gun which would disintegrate anything I pointed it at. But although I hadn't met any monsters yet, I decided this wasn't what I really wanted to do right now, so I went back down the hall and up the concrete stairs again. And I went up several flights, thinking that symbolically I was starting to go into higher levels of consciousness this way, and that if I went high enough, I might have a very mystical or psychic type experience. As I went up the stairs, the steps became less dingy-looking and dank. And then at one point I walked over along one of the halls to a wider set of stairs in the center of the building, thinking that symbolically I would be ascending to the upper reaches of consciousness in a more grand way this way. And eventually, exercising a fairly high degree of conscious manipulation, I ended up in a tower room up at the very top of this building, from which I was able to look out over the countryside. And I was careful not to stand too close to the edge, because I hadn't created the railing very strongly. Then there followed some conscious effort on my part to keep maintaining this dream of being at the top of the tower, and this was interspersed by two or three episodes, I don't recall exactly where they occurred, but they were from here on, of partially waking up from the dream and starting to hear the sounds of the house - in my body - but by an effort, managing to suppress them again and slide back into the dream. Each time I went into this condition of hearing what was going on in the room about me (what I thought was going on in the room around me), I noticed my body seemed to be fairly effectively paralyzed right at the time also. There was more of the dream in which I was still semi-conscious and controlling it, but I don't recall it.",Negative

"This dream was epic, like a feature film in length, conjuring up a completely new world. As in many dreams, there seems to be multiple strands to the plot which aren't consistent with each other. Firstly I was at university - but it was unlike any I've been to before. The campus appears to be built inside the ruins of an ancient Greek or Roman city. I say ruins, however some of the buildings were still quite complete, like the student halls of residence for example. These halls were inside a huge circular building that was lined on the edge with a series of columns and a balcony or walkway that appeared to have little protection from the elements. There was also a huge drop to the ground to one side of the walkway, with only a stone balustrade for protection. This building was next to the sea and the waves were angrily crashing against the foot of the building several stories below. The building was of marble or some other stone and had been originally carved intricately, but the weather (and perhaps the sea) had eroded all the details and edges away, so it was ridged and knobbly but smooth. The stone was a honey color, very hard and matte like honey colored granite, but from a distance it had a soft luminescence a bit like porcelain. Inside the building, the actual student accommodation was a more modern re-fit done on the cheap. Partitions of undecorated ply wood and plaster board had been fixed up to divide the space into smaller compartments. It almost felt like a squat. In another strand to the plot, this building is where my friend Toby and his friend have their design studio. His friend is quite arrogant and appears to be the one in control. I seem to be joining their team at the point where they are about to present their new 'fantastic idea' to their new client. It appears to be an industrial design idea, and it is this: applying a thin layer of silver paint to things, thus creating the look of silver but at a low cost. I try to point out that the practice of doing this is already widespread and that this is no idea at all. But they are stubborn and ignore me. So we all go to the student shop to pick up some silver spray paint. The student shop is huge, like a mall, but full of stalls inside, like a market. It is apparently run by students. Some of the stalls are actually very expensively made glass cases set into mahogany dressers - like something you'd see in a Victorian jewellery shop. One girl is selling silverware. I ask her for an 18th century dagger. Amazingly she has one, but it's too small I say. She's dressed in an almost gothic way, but more theatrical, perhaps like a Victorian vampire. This place is bustling with students. The mall appears to be constructed sunk into the ground. The entrance is from above, as if descending down into an underground tube, except the whole thing is open. There seems to be only two very narrow sets of steps leading down and both are completely clogged up with people. There's a large plastic tube - perhaps it has something to do with construction (like the tubes you sometimes see going from the upper floors of a building to a skip). It is large enough to slide down, so that's how we get down, to avoid joining the long queue on the steps. Other stuff happened in this dream, but I can't recall the details.",Negative
I was outside somewhere. There were clouds and they were very vivid and very dark grey. There was a storm coming and I had to get inside. I found cover and then started pouring down. Then it was The Soprano's and I was at their house which was different. I went to the toilet and there were two doors to it. I opened one door and someone pushed back and I realised Meadow was in there. Later I went out and then it was a movie and this girl and guy were separated from each other. They were both under separate cover from the rain but to get to each other they had to walk a fair way outside. I was seeing from the girl's point of view and she went up the stairs and around to him. They kissed and hugged and then went to go find better cover. Then Farrah had been seen this guy but Justin Bieber was staying in the same area and she liked him. She snuck out one night and I saw her. She ran into a room but I heard someone coming and I hid behind a pillar. They went away and I ran into the same room. She was hiding under the bed and I joined her. Someone came in but as they were leaving they caught us. Her mother was angry and yelling at both of us and I yelled at her while I was alone with her saying 'big deal'.,Negative
"I went to some nightclub thing. It was a bit strange though. It was near closing or past closing and we were still in there. There was me, Mom and Ezra. We went to the toilet and the doors were all closed, but they'd just been pushed to. Mom went into a cubicle and I went to the one next to it. Ezra decided to go to one as well. Then a lady who worked there came in and I put the lid down and stood on top of it because I thought she was dodgy. Mom made a noise, but the lady ignored it and went straight into my cubicle. I ran out. We all got back together somehow and I was saying that I'd read about something or other where it's a maze to get out of and they 'take' you. This place didn't look that difficult to get around so I wondered why this would be the place, but then the lights flickered and went out. I'm not sure what happened next but I was captured as well as a friend of Ezra's called Cody something. The people were saying that originally we were going to be paired together, but they swapped us around so that I would be with Stephen Merchant (who they had captured a few days before). I kept asking why we were paired up but no-one answered me. I was thinking 'well, I might die but at least I get to be with Stephen Merchant'. We got moved to some place where a whole bunch of us were crammed in and walking fast. Stephen Merchant was there and I was asking him what happened to us and where they were taking us but he said he didn't know (also, he looked a lot younger). Then were in a big cabin thing in the woods. There was a big room full of beds and lounges. We each had a bag of stuff and had to pick a bed. I waited for Steve to walk over to a bed, and he went with this soft one near the window in the back of the room. There was a paired-lounge across the wall. He put his bag on it and started taking stuff out when this guy put his bag on the bed and I said 'that's our bed' and he was like 'I was here first'. I jumped on the bed and said 'no, he just put his bag on the lounge which goes with this bed and we were already taking our stuff out so we were here first' and the guy begrudgingly left. I was still trying to work out why they needed us and why we were paired up with someone. Some theories were they were going to 'breed' something, sacrifice us, use us as food or combine us.",Negative
"White Black Bear  I'm deer hunting with my friends Stephen and Jose Ramos. We're returning after the morning hunt, to the camper, the car, and the refrigerator. I see something white up on a hill.

He shoots the large bear in the head. It falls down. Stephen falls at the same time, as if he has been shot. He is then back up, and he shoots again, and hits the bear in the head.

"There were zombies. I was doing an obstacle course thing. I saw zombies come running through the bush. I ran inside to go to ""the sun room"" which was a classroom in the shape of a sun. I let some people in and closed the door. It had no locks but the zombies couldn't get in. One of the windows showed a classroom with 5 year olds and Peter Krause was there. The zombies came and got them. Then it wasn't a classroom and it was this weird place with lots of people. The doors kept opening and I went around closing them and then noticed that people were missing. A guy there was sending people out to die. Then I was with Mom and someone else living in this small room. I was driving in a Ute with Mom and Darren. It was a Nissan. We drove down this path for a bit which had small trees planted across it. We were marking things down on a map so we knew where exits were. Then we were on foot and there were bushes to one side. Zombies came and we ran.

Later I was in a clothes section. Darius was wearing that dressing gown that I liked. I went through the clothes looking for another but there weren't any others, then I saw him wearing another blue one so I went back to look again. When I saw him again he was wearing the one I liked and he had bought it. I complained to Mom and him that I'd wanted it for ages. He said ""Well, it's either yours or mine"".

"Matthew and I were going to paint the kitchen. We took down all the Christmas decorations. I specifically remember peeling off the stick-on's, but they were even on the refrigerator door. I kept finding more. When we started painting, we did just a little bit under the windowsill to see how it would look after it dried. The next morning we looked at it and it was a yellowish-beige instead of teal. I took a razor blade and started scraping off the top layer, which exposed the teal. But the teal part was somewhat wet and left it looking rough or textured rather than smooth. I said, well, we could make it work this way. Then Matthew, or perhaps someone else, found the problem and pointed it out. It says to use egg noodles and the ones we used weren't egg. I ate some of the non-egg noodles and then rinsed my mouth as though I had just brushed my teeth. I brushed them over and over again. My teeth and mouth seemed to be coated with teal paint and the water kept rinsing it out. Matthew came up and said, the water is clear now mom! I rinsed a couple more times anyway.",Positive

I caught up with Alexei and later on when I saw him again he gave me and Tiana autographs and took us over to the rest of the guys for autographs and photos. He was dressed as a vampire and was putting on a little show and this weird music was playing. 'House of Fun' then started playing and everyone was like eh?

"I dreamed that the boy I am pinned to died. I could see him very plainly lying on a plank with his light blue sweater on. He is 26.

"Sara Miller's Grudge  I buy something at a store, and then I go to the service desk. My friend from Brimson Sara Miller is working there. I haven't seen her in a while, and she has longer hair. I go up to her and she doesn't talk to me. Another woman assists me. I want to put something on my credit card, when I had actually written a check for it. Then Sara speaks to me. She is holding a grudge against me: she says I'm a ____ (the equivalent of an asshole or a fucker). The woman that is assisting me says something. I decide to play the asshole role that Sara says I am, so I tell the woman to shut the fuck up. I say to Sara, ""You know how I am: I mean no offense"", implying that she has no reason to hold a grudge against me. She changes her attitude towards me and gives me a piece of paper that says Happy Birthday Kenneth. We seem to get along fine then, and she is her smiling self.",Positive
"I dreamed that I went into the Commodore Bar alone and ordered a glass of port and Seven Up from a waitress, but was feeling a little guilty about being in a bar all by myself at night. The order was brought in a cup with the Seven Up, and the port in the bottle, only it wasn't port. It was whiskey or something. The bottle was horizontally laid on the table, and I knew I shouldn't pick it up. Somehow the drink was spilled in the cup and I put a napkin in a saucer to soak it up. I drank it and expected my head to become dizzy, but nothing happened. On the way out, I saw two girls who I know who were drinking some beer, but whether I stayed with them I don't know.",Negative
"Okay, this is sometime in the middle of July, 2002. Last night I dreamt that I was at Bancroft Middle School, but I was in Warrior Vision from Westport High School, and I was sitting there at their board and it had a blue faders except they weren't uniform all the way across. The mono-mike channels were pots and the rest were blue faders, and I was trying to work this board and we were under a lot of stress to try and get this show done right now, and Mrs. Talmadge was trying to get us to do something. And then the bell rang and Melinda came over to me and said that Mrs. Hollander's class was going to be in the auditorium. And then all of a sudden the halls and stuff were like at Bancroft, and Mrs. Hollander's class was up on this other floor and I had to run up to her room and get my stuff. And then I was like running through the halls to get to the auditorium on time.

"I remember that a friend of mine and I were walking by a familiar, but not too often frequented place. I don't remember why we were walking that way. Before getting to the corner, my friend turned around and, pointing to somebody on the opposite side of the street, asked me whether it was a man or a woman. The fact is that it was very difficult to tell, and I told him so. Then he told me that even though it was a man, he could pass for a woman. This would have alarmed me if it had really happened, but in the dream it did not bother me at all. Rather, I told him that I would find out the gender of the person. Then my friend asked me for a cigarette, but he did this in a ""charming"" manner, if that is the expression, I suppose, so that I would not refuse him. But I did not have any cigarettes, and I told him so. The way he asked me for the cigarette irritated me.",Negative
"I was watching a movie. A boy and his parents were at their house. They looked out the window to see a huge dinosaur/monster in the distance. The husband was a scientist or something, so he sent his son and wife away and said to contact some guy if they needed to. They ran, but didn't take their car as they thought it would ""be easier to see"". The monster was just flattening buildings. Then I was there and as I ran, I looked back and saw it flatten their house and I told the wife. They ran into an underground section of a building. There were a few others there and it was pitch black. They ran upstairs and I followed and said we should stay underground. We ran up a few floors and it was a shop, and it was circular, the shops were around the outer edge and the middle just had escalators and the like. I repeated that we should go back underground and then there was a scream and it was in the building. There were some elevators, but they only fit 1-2 people in them and they were a cylindrical tube and teleported. They were also randomly distributed. I was with Farrah and Charlene and we were trying to find one. We ran into a small shop and we all managed to get in. It started shaking (as the monster was coming closer) and then we were teleported up a few floors. We ran and got to the top floor. There was a room and it had a TV, shelves, lounges and piles of books. Calvin was there now, along with quite a few others. I said that we had to find somewhere to hide. I took a window off and there was a small balcony going right around the room. There was stuff piled up in front of the windows, enough for us to sit behind. I was telling them to sit behind those areas and to be quick and to not move when they got there. They didn't really listen to me and some were painting this small wood section of the wall black, from white. Then we realized the monster was coming and everyone got into place. One girl was in some oxygen thing and was floating in the fish tank. Calvin was lying on this wood railing that was joined to the balcony and dipped down a little and I said that it was a good idea and I went on there too, but then I realized I couldn't see the room now and it was uncomfortable but it was too late to move. I thought I was going to fall. Then the monster came and it stuck its head out of the window and it didn't see us, but kept looking back out. I realized it must be able to smell us.",Negative
"I was in Europe at Virgin Mary Shrine. I went each day and stared into the face of Mary, who was young and fresh-looking as Michelangelo's Pieta, but was holding infant here, not Christ from Cross). One day she looked at me, warmly. Next time she left and came in the shadow where I stood and kissed me on the mouth (she looked like a student of mine four years ago who is young and virginal, and has reputation of resisting all sexual advances) and walked--almost drifted--back into the white statue. The statue never left during this trip to kiss me. The shrine was high up on top of building with long and straight stairs up, all white stone or painted wood--brilliant white--even roof and rafters or open beams, gothic peaks and pedestal except where long lines of tourist's feet had worn paint off and exposed brown wood below. During the kiss, the tourists in the line did not see her, but she seemed nervous and seemed to say--or said--""Don't let them see us or they will kill both of us.""

"A few days ago I watched half of this movie that had Joshua Jackson in it. Then it was today and I watched the rest of it. At the end he had turned fat and this girl had turned skinny. Everyone fell to their stomach. Some people melted because it was hot. I was watching it with Dad. There was a battle between Joshua Jackson's character (who was not him now) and Maryann (True Blood). It was in like an elevator. She did something with air and fizzy water and she said she was ""a water Pokemon"". He attacked her for a while but she was fine and attacked him and he got owned. He brought comic book characters out to help, one of them was Batman. In real life I was then at home and Joshua Jackson or his character was there. Some friends turned crazy and tried to kill us. We locked them outside and we ran next door. We knocked and they let us in. There were lots of people there all lazing about. A guy was on the phone. A friend and I picked up the other phone and were listening to his conversation. He was talking to a guy and it sounded like they were in a relationship.",Negative
"I'm at a family reunion in a large fine house with grounds (or a maybe a rented public building like in a park) - maybe it's granite or something, very imposing. I'm on a little round balcony with a few others (I think men), there are lots more people inside. I feel faint and collapse. They see that I'm very sick, and quickly take me to a car to go to the hospital. (I don't see any of that, the next I know is that I'm lying in the back seat of the car - a sedan - going like gangbusters on a huge freeway. It must be 5 lanes in each direction, lots of cars but not crowded, and all going really fast. I can't see anything else but freeway and blue sky, with a few white clouds. As we barrel along, the road rises, and quickly - soon it changes to steps, which doesn't slow anybody down, and it keeps going up, the incline increasing. Now my line of sight changes to a spot at the side of the freeway (outside of the car), looking across it - and the incline (without the steps) takes a sharp turn up to vertical. The cars are not stopping or even slowing down, and they whoosh straight up. They make it about halfway up on momentum, and then gravity takes over and they fall down. I can see them sort of drop off [rather than sliding down still in contact with the pavement] and fall down way below me.",Negative

"I'm with a bunch of other people, at least some are family. I see a child running around, kind of playing, with a small container holding several wafers of the Holy Eucharist. I'm upset that this is occurring. Someone tells me that Daddy gave this to the child. His intentions were good as he wanted the child to know about the Holy Eucharist, become familiar with it, and appreciate it as much as he does. The container was the same size in diameter as the wafers but it was three or four times deeper than the ones we use to take communion to the homebound. It was gold in color. It was still very upsetting to me that he had given this to a child because I thought the Eucharist in it was consecrated. I was talking to someone about this and they didn't think that it was. I was saying that, even so, I didn't think it was a good idea because it wasn't teaching the child proper respect for the Eucharist - and what if it was in fact consecrated. How can one be absolutely sure one way or the other? I was having a conversation with Daddy but I don't know if we talked about this at all. We did talk about his good intentions in how he talks to others about God and religion, especially when he sounds like he is lecturing, or telling others how to live. I wanted him to understand how it makes people feel, how it feels judgmental and how it sometimes just makes people feel very uncomfortable. I was trying to be gentle yet honest. I wanted to be careful what I said or how I said it because I didn't want to hurt him or cause him to become upset. I'm not sure he understood what I meant.

"It was summer, and a beautiful day. We were out at a lake on a picnic. I was swimming and had been doing some diving. It must have been early in the season because I remember seeing a girl with a beautiful tan and wishing that I had one as dark. Then suddenly I was standing in line, but I didn't know why. One of my girlfriends (a redhead age 19) was in back of me, and we began talking. Again the scene changed and I was in a beautiful castle, or mansion. There was very little light, but I wasn't alone. The last thing I remember was going upstairs. Interpretation The second part, when I was in the mansion, I have no idea of what it means. However, the first part, when I was swimming, probably meant that I wish summer were here and that I could go swimming (this is my favorite sport).

"I dreamt that my parents were planning a dinner party for 7:00. Preparations were not yet completed when the doorbell rang and our guests arrived. They were a middle-aged doctor and his wife, actual friends of ours. Mother was dressed in a black and white checked dress and in general the house was in an uproar. We seated our guests at a small table for two. There were two other large tables. one of these tables was occupied by Mother and Dad and several other relatives whom I can't remember. I too, sat with them. The third table was occupied by a group of unknowns, among whom were two girls who had been called to serve that evening. We proceeded with our meal and serving was done in a very inefficient manner. We had chicken, some sort of potatoes and green peas which were dished out into small plates. It seemed to take ages until all the tables were served from the central table where we sat. I kept thinking there wouldn't be enough to go around. Our two guests conversed continually with one another. I noticed that the table was littered with empty ginger ale bottles and told the two girls to clear them away. Interpretation This might be the aftermath of a week ago, when I was chairman of a large social gathering. The amount of food we ought to order, the type of serving that was to be done, and all such matters played on my mind for a long time. All went well, but the food almost did run out. Also, this evening the doorbell rang before I expected my date and not being ready, I was rather perturbed. This might have some connection with the early arrival of our dinner guests.

They were going to talk and we were going to pounce on the other group and steal their new clothes that they were giving out. Well, I think it ended up being a trick because all the clothes we stole were red. I remember Julia had red shoes and I had a red short dress. We booked off and planned to hide in the woods but saw that a storm was coming. The image of the storm that I remember was amazing - very fast moving swirls in the distance. We decided to build a fire in what was similar to the empty classrooms in Z. City.

"Mom and Dad were in Canada, and they were going to drive down and come and get me and go back to the cabin and they did. And Mom drove down, and she said that Dad was waiting at the cabin and we were trying to get stuff together, and she was looking for her little personal tape player unit, and she couldn't find it. So we just started out the door and we started driving, and all of a sudden Dad appeared in the passenger seat. Now I remember. We were driving to the cabin, and we got to the cabin and Dad stressed the importance of being quiet and stuff. And some force made me turn on the sound equipment, it happened to be in a room in the cavern that looks just like my workroom, and I couldn't turn it off.

"In the next dream, I was sort of observing a story. It took place out on the desert, and two people were trying to get rid of these two other people, and primarily this one person, by getting rid of their water supply, and also by harming this vulture which followed the two people who were walking along on the desert everywhere. And the two people who were trying to harm the other two were, I don't know what they were doing, following them along in an airplane or something, but they weren't walking along on the desert. But I joined the two people who were on the desert, and walked along with them, and we tried to think of some way to escape. And we came to a big building, and there were two ways that we could go. And we all of a sudden ran and went in the door at the bottom of this building, hoping that these other two people wouldn't see us, but they did. And we had a little bit of water with us, and we were trying to conserve it, but at the same time we decided that we would go up the stairs very fast and maybe lose these people who were following us. And so we did, and there were twelve levels to this building. And we got to the 11th level, and as you went up, there was less and less actual building and more sort of this terrace that was built around it. And the 11th story, about half of it was this terrace, and the 12th story, which was the top, was all terrace, and some sort of military establishment or camp or something, although there was nothing there but this big open space with some grass planted around it, glassed off and wired off from the big drop down to the ground. And I didn't much want to go to either of these stories, but finally I did. And there were these other people there, and I realized that I was going to eventually have to fight with the leader of the group, which was also something I didn't want to do, and especially there since it seemed dangerous. And wire, barbed wire, was strung around the outside of this terrace on all sides, overhead, about 20 feet off the ground, poles or something stretching across and around the terrace were these very high tension wires. And as you watched them, you could see the electricity leaking off them, this artificial lightning crackling across the top of the terrace. And I thought that this would be a very beautiful place if it weren't so dangerous. And I was up there for a little while, and then I had to go back down to change into pajamas. And then I was going to fight this person. And I was hoping to put it off as long as possible. I went down to about the 9th level, I believe. This was where my family lived. And I went into one room and my brother was there, my older brother. And I had my pajamas with me and so I just undressed in front of him and put them on, and this didn't seem to be too unusual or too shocking in the dream. And then we started singing this Easter hymn. And that was about the end of that dream. But I thought it was interesting because of all the various levels and everything.",Negative

"I met up with some old friend of mine and we started hanging out quite a bit. A cat appeared, which I recognized, and they tried to get rid of it. It kept coming back and they decided to just keep it. I can't remember what happened, but I killed my friend. I attacked her and pulled her face off, etc. I left and then sent her a message to ask what she was doing, to try and cover it up. Then it wasn't me. The person, who had killed her, was having vivid nightmares that she thought were real. Then it was some weird day where people turned into whatever they were thinking about at a certain point in time. This fat lady that I knew was talking to me. She said she had just had sex with this young guy, who was called Brad (he looked like a surfer).",Negative
"As I first remember the dream I was upstairs in a room with my sister-in-law, who is a nurse. I was mixing some blue chemicals. We were talking happily, next I was out in another room with my girlfriend from school. A teacher, whom I can't recall, was lining all the girls, (many of whom I recognized and spoke with) in a straight line to have their tonsils out. I stood in the line at first and then, finally remembering that I had had my tonsils out, I left with my girlfriend. We went downstairs and there in a little room off to one side, were a group of fellows singing and laughing. We stopped and talked with a few, and then we left. Interpretation I cannot interpret much meaning to this dream. I am taking chemistry at the present, and might be conscious of my sister-in-law, because she is a nurse and I am making my application now to send to a training hospital. I can't imagine how the tonsils fit into the dream, although it is true that mine are out. Answers to questions 2.

"I was in a class- supposedly my last before graduation.  The class was to split into two groups.  One sat while the other acted, and then they switched.  It was something we'd done before.  Five or six kids crouched below the front seats near the stage to avoid being picked for the first group.  Our teacher was a black woman named Nina.  For some reason she had to leave, and so my boyfriend's brother Jeff and I were supposed to take over, since he was good at art and I'd already graduated.  We went into a multipurpose room.  One of the girls looked familiar.  She recognized me too, and then I realized who she was- Marissa from fourth grade.  I was messing around doing the splits, and she made a comment as to being able to do them at least as well.",Positive

"I was in school and there was this project that students could work on. It was like basically an aquarium with the Little Mermaid stuff in it, and it had to get permission to be out of class for like two days a week for the rest of the semester to work on it. And I dreamt that I got it online and I got two of the raw materials to do it. I got the stand and the top, and the aquarium itself was going to be in a teapot and I got that. And I set it on the counter ready to go, and I, all of a sudden I was in this reception hall with my system, Peavey system set up and I was adjusting the faders so somebody could talk on the microphone as they wished and it wouldn't feed back. [laugh] And I couldn't remember who was talking on it or what they said, but they were walking around pretty good and I was real nervous they were going to go over too close to the speakers and make it feed back, and then I would be blamed for it. And I do remember there was a guy next to me which I was adjusting the equalizer, well, while the person was talking on the microphone I started a Kenny D CD playing, and the EQ just sounded terrible, so I was sitting there adjusting it. And I was telling this guy that was sitting there that I keep my hand on the microphone fader so that if it starts to feed, I can just bring it down immediately. And I remember then we were starting to pack it up, and for some reason I realized I was naked. And I was putting all the stuff back in the boxes. I only put one of the speakers on top of the Peavey box and Dad was already hauling it out to the truck and there was another stand standing freely. Then I don't remember what happened, and then I woke up.",Negative
"I was in a swimming pool and saw Tina Mayo there with one of her daughters.  The pool was on different levels.  She was almost ready to go back to work.  Maybe at the same swimming pool, there was a snake in the water-then I saw another one.  I got out and looked for something to hit them with.  I found a long tree limb.  Before I could get back to the pool, I encountered first one and then the other on land.  I hit them and killed them, cutting them in half and ensuring that the cut was close to their heads.  One of them was left with its mouth open wide, just like in a picture that was also in the dream.  There were lots more to kill, but when I started back to the pool, there was a door, and the door was over a slippery slope; I was afraid if I went through I would slide down and into the water.  I wanted to hit the snakes from outside the pool,",Negative

She misses locations, wanders off' etc and Esther and I were confused and she said 'Izzy's right here, Hector' and went to talk to him saying I'd done it a million times and I was fine. Hugo said, to no-one in particular, that he 'trusted me completely'. Hector came in with the laptop with proof and Hugo complained that he was embarrassing me.

"Bear Attack  I'm in a tent with my roommate Stephen Ramos. I wake up from sleeping and remember a dream. The dream is as follows: We are deer hunting on his land. We are down by his brother Jose's deer stand. We see a huge black bear. We slowly walk backwards. The huge bear wanders away. I see two more black bears. They are smaller than the first, but still big. Then there are many bears all over the place. Stephen and I each have a shotgun with slugs. Stephen puts on a bear mask. It looks like the real head of a bear. The bears come near to me. I shoot three of the bears in the head: Jake and two other bears. Another bear, which is my classmate Melvin Dahlheimer, is upon me, and I am out of slugs. I awake from this dream, and don't have my dream journal. Stephen tells me I should have defecated before I went to bed because I was farting in my sleep. I know this isn't possible, but don't say anything to him. We are at our deer-hunting campsite. Jose and Franco Ramos are there too. I look out the door of our tent and see two hunters walking down the path along the fence towards Jose's deer stand. It is getting light outside. I realize we have overslept and are losing valuable hunting time. I get up. I have my Washington University pajama pants on. I go out of the tent. There are two men on the edge of our camp. They are on the edge of the woods. Our camp seems to be between the house and the woods, just south of the house. The men see a buck, and we see it too. It is close to camp, and we are in the line of fire for these men, so we move. The men scare the buck by throwing a flaming piece of two by four wood at it and firing a shot in front of it. The deer runs. Everyone fires at the deer, including Jose. At first, it looks like Jose is using a handgun. The deer escapes unscathed. It runs into the field. People fired shots to make it run in a certain direction, so they could shoot it. I am looking for my bag of clothes. I can't find it.",Negative
"I was dreaming about this group of men. They were planning robberies. One of them was the leader, and they were discussing what they were going to go out and steal that night. The plan was that when he had made a good robbery, he would stick around and help look for the robbers to help get rid of suspicion on yourself. There was a bus and a couple of major crooks and there was some minor ones. They were doing everything very carefully. They were in black face so they were disguised. They were covered with something, but it was a little hard to see. They all left. They were upstairs in the building or something. They left and one of the anxious guys wanted to be a robber, but he wasn't very good at it. They were putting him down. They didn't want him to go with them. Everybody else was very careful and they could leave without making any marks, and this other guy, he runs off the building and falls to the cement. He gets up, but he leaves, you know, a mark, marks on his clothes and the stuff he had on. He kind of gives away the whole thing, or if somebody saw the stuff on the cement, it would give away the whole thing. That's all. Hall: Sam was a spectator, not a participant. He was just watching it. They were all men, the robbers were.",Negative
"There were three people involved, myself and two fellows whom I didn't recognize. There was no particular setting. Me and one fellow took the other fellow and tied him to a reclining tree or bench or such. It was at a 45 degree angle. Our mood was playful and we were aware of what we were doing. After tying the guy, we poured gas over his feet and lit it. I did this all with the intent to stop before the guy was hurt. I waited for the other guy to realize what he was doing. He never said anything and for some reason I didn't put out the fire. The guy on fire was screaming, naturally. The dream ended there.

One of them, the one I know best, came over to me and told me that they were collecting money which they needed for a problem all of them were in. I told them I could help them with us much as I had. Then they asked me for 250 dollars and I was amazed and told them that, with the holidays, the next day I could give them 10 or 20 dollars at the most.

I see my aunt Joanne Redding, and a half-dozen other faces that I know to be Reddings, but can't put a name to. I see my uncle Adam Redding, and several men next to him that I know are his friends. One or some of these men may be gay, and may be Adam's current or former boyfriend. I think: I know a lot of Reddings that would come to be prominent in this society.",Positive

"I was going shopping with a girlfriend for a present for a boy I date. We were in a store which itself was a cross between a department store and a dime store. We looked at a couple of ties first. One was a narrow gray tie, the others were white with a design in a slightly darker shade. I didn't like any of the ties and we then looked at sweaters. The one sweater which I did consider was a brown plaid sweater. While deciding, we also picked out a roll of gray wrapping paper with blue ribbon. I couldn't decide whether or not to take the sweater because it had to go with a cocoa brown suit which I knew the boy had. The salesgirl came over and cut off a piece of ribbon so that I could find another piece of ribbon that length which would match the color of the suit. We decided not to take the sweater as it was wool and too heavy and left, taking with us the wrapping paper and the ribbon. We sort of sneaked out as we were afraid the salesgirl might see us. We then decided to buy a nylon sweater instead, a sleeveless sweater.",Negative
"There was a big dark green shed in which medical stuff went in. House (House) usually worked in there and didn't allow others by themselves. He was standing outside a fair way away, so all the doctors, myself included, ran in and tried to lock the door. There were two latches and I tried to lock them together but they just kept swinging around. I couldn't work it out and he was coming so I just ran back. He came in and pulled a lever to make this stuff pour from the rood, which was like animal insides. Before it got to me, I ran out. Then I was behind the big shed at home, which now had a fair amount of space next to the fence. I had gotten clothes from the second storey of the shed. The shed three storeys, but they were tiny (not high enough for a person to stand, just to store stuff). I was going out with Eugene I think and he was out the back too. He had clothes in the shed too. I was getting dressed and I heard him coming around the shed to see if I was there and I banged on the shed so he didn't come and he jumped and didn't come around. The shirt I had had a picture of Pikachu (Pokemon) and me on it. I put it on and came out. He was sitting at the table under the patio thing with Mom and some others. There was a chair next to him, so he stood up and moved so I could get in. The pool was clear and we were going to go in. Later, I was at Mom's old house. I left with Eugene. I needed to go the toilet so walked up the stairs to get there.",Negative
"Dad and I went to a shop thing and he ordered two Kitkats each, but they gave us two altogether. We went to a stationery shop and there were no notebooks left. We ended up at Raquel's and she had a different mother and brother (who was young, fat and big with curly orange hair). At one point, I said he was 'gay and stupid' and his mother yelled at me for using the word 'gay'. I said 'it's just a word' and she carried on and I said 'in this generation, it is not insulting and homophobic, it's a word. It's people like you that make it homophobic' etc. Then she told me 'get out of my house'. There was a fridge outside and I had to get 5-6 trays of cakes and things. I took them back to the car but they were empty -- they had fallen onto the grass, so I just left. Abed (Community) was with us and he told me to turn in to a carpark and then go to this deli place. I went in with Dad and asked if I should get a new Kitkat. There was a phone near the door and I said 'is this Ian's [Community]?' and Dad said yes, that he used it to bill him as a joke. I replied to something on Facebook from my phone and it said 'from Steve'. I left and Abed came back from where he went.",Negative
"I had a dream that the girls' lacrosse team had a really early game one day or something, so they had to wake up at 6am on Sunday. Leanne was complaining that this was unfair because no one else had to wake up, so she demanded that the entire school wake up at 6am as well. I turned to her and snapped, ""It's going to be really unfair when you get into Princeton because of your lacrosse skills, when far more deserving people get turned down, especially when they are much smarter than you!""

"And then I went back to sleep and had a dream about Modern Media College. I dreamt that, first of all -- this is the crazy part -- I think I've been watching too much TV -- there were these four or five people in my room that were kind of talking to us and all, and there was this one boy who wanted to see my DP program because he wanted to learn to mix too. And I said I'm going to come back and show it to him, and I went and told Mom. These four girls were the ones they weren't sure about. Apparently I had the notion they had been discovered in a room that had a meth lab underneath it. Oh, my gosh, I don't know what's up for that. But after that scene I was at Modern Media College, which really I started off being at Westport College and I sort of found myself there at Modern Media College, and it was a real maze. I came in with Mom and Dad, sort of like at the top of a little hallway, and down to one side was an auditorium, a big auditorium, where you know how the seats go, they went down. And to the other side was steps down into the lobby of the building, and all of this was real colorful like their brochures are. It was like in that brown and black and orange mainly, like their brochure pictures are. And to the left there was lots of little treats and stuff that they set out for people coming in, like little glasses with jello and stuff, and little dessert dishes and ice cream and brownies and stuff. And to the right was lots of stuff, lots of other facilities. And Mom and Dad kind of trailed behind me and let me run along ahead, and it was like a real maze. By the way, I didn't taste any of the treats; I don't know why. And I went around to this other stairwell that led back up, and I wanted to see what was up there because I -- oh, before that -- this is kind of crazy. For some reason I had this set of cans that I picked up from the floor, and when I got to the bottom of the stairwell I turned around and there was these people standing by this little six-channel mixer up on the wall, they were controlling the sound system of the house. And I gave the set to them, and they said, ""Oh thanks, they belong here."" And then I turned around and I went up this other stairwell and Mom and Dad were like behind me, but they were a few feet behind me. And I met up with this other, I had the notion like he was a sound engineer, but he was kind of giving us a tour, and he took me up this stairwell that turned into like a ladder to his little recording booth. And there was this opening that was like really, really small, and he said, ""Nobody can get in here like this."" He gave me his, like a ticket thing. I slid it in the slot and the whole ladder moved down and the whole thing opened up so that it was then the opening was about from my chest to my head, so then a person could crawl in. But the recording booth was still so small. I don't know how anybody could sit in there and work comfortably. And I was feeling really claustrophobic at this point because not only was I going to have to go in the small recording booth, but I was going to have to go in the, it was just real tight all around. And then he took us down and outside, and kind of around the back of the building, and we were like in a straw barn and we were sitting on benches kind of outside the straw barn, with hay all around and stuff. And there was a reinforcement system out there in the straw barn, and some guy turned it on and walked away. And for some reason I was so bold, I went up and I sat down at the mixer bench area, and the mixer board was green, kind of like an integrated circuit board, but it had all the stuff right on it, and it was flat. I found the two left and right CD faders and I brought them up, and I tweaked some EQ and stuff, and I was watching the videos [?] and finally I brought up my master a little. And I went back to my seat and then I woke up.",Negative
"I still have to think about that sometimes! [the year] I can't remember too much about what I was dreaming last night, but I know that, I remember one scene real vividly. I dreamt that I think I might have been at either Aunt Christine's house or at some other strange house. But I had a feeling like it was somebody's house that I had just been to the first time. And I didn't really know the people, and they had like an upper second story, and they had a living room real similar to ours. And then they had a cellar and the stairs are just like ours except they were a lot less steep, they went at a much more gradual grade for a much longer period of distance. And I had to go get something from in their cellar, and, oh no, I think I had to go to the bathroom down there. And what you had to go is you had to go down the steps, and then there was like a hallway, and to your right was a bathroom, to the left was some other kind of junk room, and if you kept going straight and down a couple more steps, you'd have an even deeper, darker cellar. And by the way, in all of this, there was one light switch at the head of the stairs that controlled the lights for all three of those rooms down there and the stairway. And I had to go to the bathroom and somebody was in the first story bathroom, and I was going down the stairs of the cellar, and it didn't actually happen, but I was having a vision of what would happen if somebody were to see the door open and the light on, and they just switched off the switch and everything went dark, how I would just scream! And after that thought, I decided I wasn't going to go to the bathroom down there, that I was going to hold it some more. So then I woke up, and I really had to go. [laugh]",Negative
"Remember loose bear. My class was having a party in the same building they film either Star Wars or Star Trek, and we were going to sleep over. Our photography teacher was there and when the rest of the class was off doing something, I talked with Jan and he basically told me that he was homeless. After I talked with him I went to find a place to sleep. I went up to the loft and I saw Diana holding on to the top of her rolled up sleeping bag when it was vertical. Then it just fell over and I thought she could only do that because it was her birthday. I decided not to sleep in the loft because I would be so separated. There was a bear chained down in a room and after I looked in the loft, I looked under the wall to bear's room and I saw a bear foot chained down. I poked my head all the way through and the bear was gone. Steve was with me and picked up a rifle and I told him not to and he just scoffed at me. I picked up a rifle, then said, ""OK, fine."" I also picked up a handgun and ran out shouting that there was a loose bear. I ran into the room and they were filming Star _____ and shouted the warning and everyone panicked.

But today, I'm doing my research paper on dreams, and today I was reading a book and it was talking about all this stuff involved with dreams and what happens when you dream and stuff. And the only thing that was coming to me from my frame of reference was this stupid dream, so I figured there's got to be something to it, so I guess I'm going to go ahead and put it down here. I dreamt that we were in our living room. It was Mom, Dad and I think Aunt Christine and Burt were in town, and we were sitting around talking about different things. And I was sitting on the floor and everybody else was sitting on like the couch. And then it was Mom and me and some guy -- I don't know who -- and Mom had these candy-coated almond nut things that were kind of real rough and like big, and this is the bizarre part. Mom wanted me to, I think she was going to do some and she wanted me to do some. She wanted us to smooth them out and make them smaller, and the way to do it was to put them on the bed in front of us and to like lay on the bed and like self-satisfy ourselves. And I saw Mom do that with the ________s and they went from these big pecans or almonds to these small, really sweet candies. And, you know, I don't remember too much more.

"I'm standing in front of a pantry [?]...as opposed to the kind you walk into, I think I meant...small closet in the kitchen, in a small house. The cat food is supposed to be at the bottom, on the floor of this pantry, in a rubber container, kinda like the cat litter**. What's here, at the moment, is there's cat food scattered on the floor where it's been left, as a mess. But dry cat food is stacked, if you will - really - on the right side next to the wall, as though, you might imagine, there would be a dispenser or something - but the dispenser isn't there any more, and it's in the same position. And I'm scooping up the bits, just to neaten things up, and I also notice some yellow liquid on the floor. [?] And I check it out, I'm assuming that it's cat pee, and I'm assuming that Alleycat did it, and I'm taken aback. When I check it out, touch it, it turns out to be oily and it doesn't smell, and what it turns out to be is dripped oil from one of the bottles on a lower shelf, on the floor. Things are generally kind of messy here. Now, the reason this is unusual is that in the other room, Bettye is talking to a guy that has just cleaned this place. He's kind of on the dark and swarthy side, kind of stocky, burly. He has just taken over from the guy who was doing it before, and his price is in question. It was kind of like George's thing; he had a price, raised the price, somebody else came in and lowered the price. It was like $25 to $35, and $30; and now this guy wants $33, and Bettye is hesitant about it - she's not wanting to give him 33, and there's something in it about she doesn't actually have it - I mean, she does have it, but we're kind of stretching around here. And he's explaining to her, you know, how things are, and that he needed the extra $3, and he's sort of implying that it was more work here, or something. But then in fact what I'm seeing is that he's not doing as good a job. There's like, what I'm seeing in this pantry, and elsewhere. I'm in the pantry, overhearing this, feeling kinda guilty, because of the cat food and stuff, thinking that it's my fault and that I ought to be taking part, you know, kicking in for the money - or more, anyway - I'm not actually sure how we distribute it. Bettye is kind of the head of the household, and in some respects she's running this particular thing. I kind of think Bettye is a substitute, too. And where we are is something on the order of a college neighborhood and I have just previously been in @ a scene in a place that's something like a dorm, only it's not in a building, it's like a cabin, more-like arrangement, where you're on the ground floor anyway, and have a porch, and I'm outside on the porch trying to communicate with my mother through one of those wooden necklace-things that I got from the Library Store, the Philippine things. We discovered that we could talk to each other over them; and I may be looking at this place wanting to rent it - maybe even for both of us. (Not real sure about that.) But I go out on the porch, and I seem to be facing a big group of buildings, they're kind of like Fair Park, or a college - THE UNIVERSITY just crossed my mind, too - and the atmosphere is interfering, or something; I speak to her once, and we make connection, and then I'm talking and I realize that she's not answering back, and then I can't hear the same sound that I had, and I try to get her back, and it's not working. There's a guy here, present, and I don't know what his involvement is right now, but he's part of this. He's a young, nice-looking guy, tall, dressed casually. (I don't know what I'm doing with him, exactly.) ***There was also another communication problem earlier; I kept trying to call this other [Elsa's? offices?] extension, I think it was my mother, on the office phones - there's even a switchboard here of some description, and I keep getting a wrong number. I haven't looked it up to verify what it is, and I keep being absolutely sure I've got it, and I call, get the wrong number, hang up immediately, and the person on the other end of the line is very angry. Or somewhat angry, anyhow - and the last time, even starts to threaten that she's going to call somebody to investigate. She names a party - not the police, and not the telephone company, I don't think; but in any case I'm certainly alarmed about this - not that logically, she can actually trace a call that was like that, when all it is, is just a brief connection and then hanging up - so, I don't know what that's about.",Negative

Later I went over to Donna's to say goodbye. I was leaving for school. The rest is not clear because someone woke me up.,Negative
"I'm telling my husband about what I thought was a right foolproof scheme if you were going to make some corn liquor, some moonshine, and you didn't want to be caught. I figured out a way to do it. It does sound pretty good, even now. What you would do is get a house with a big basement and a big hot furnace, maybe one of these coal-burning types, and you'd fix your still somehow so it would be right close to this furnace. You could fix something coming out from the furnace that would supply heat to your still so that you could distill your liquor. The whole thing was supposed to be mounted on wheels so if anybody did come snooping around, you could just, quick, shove the whole thing off into a closet somewhere so they wouldn't find it. We were talking about distilling wine, making wine, and we were wondering if you would distill it in any way and sort of reading a recipe or being read a recipe by somebody, and at the same time seeing this operation being carried on. The scene sort of took place in front of this large white farmhouse, somewhere out in the country. Finally we were there and this wine bit sort of faded into the background. These people were just moving into this house, this older couple and sort of a foreign couple. I guess they were in their middle 30's or something. They seemed to be somebody we knew, but I don't know who they could have been, really nobody that I can place. So we were going thru the house. I think they were showing us the house or something, and it was fairly nice, large rooms and attractive. In the kitchen, the kitchen was in two parts and in one part the woman put up a lot of dishes she wasn't going to use and wrapped each one of them in this white shelf paper, which seemed like an awful lot of work, but she had done this, and had shelf paper on the shelves under them too. The next episode in this dream was very vaguely similar to one of the things that would occur in gothic novels because it was concerned with a much oppressed heroine who -- oh, there was somebody sinister. It all took place in this farmhouse which was about as unsinister as it could be, but there was something sinister. I was trying to find the appropriate moment or something to see what was going on and so I had this book I had read in real life in my hand, which had indexed all these events. So I was going thru the index trying to find it, but I couldn't find it.",Negative

"I was with my fencing class and we were on a retreat with some of my friends. I kept on asking why Eli was being so mean to me. Everyone said he was stressed about colleges. We had to do posters of people's qualities and Linda showed us two ways to do them. I was going to do Eli and then apologize to him. I asked him how to spell his name even though I hoped he wouldn't know I was doing him. He answered ""Greuff/m."" We were by the ocean on a narrow trail. I wanted to tell him how I felt but he had left. Then we were back at the gym. My friend Gia was there and she was in a green skating dress. Linda tried to describe how Gia was skating a special part in our show. Then she asked who Evita was and then she explained who she was. Gia thought she was the Embassy Suites and I knew who she was, but I couldn't seem to say it. Then the gym turned into a skating rink and everyone started skating around. Gia raised her leg and did a spiral. Setting: A meeting room that turned into a skating rink, and a cliff, and a gym.

"(09/04/99)[""Inaccessibility not an issue when not needed.""] I am at a workshop Lucy is putting on. She tells the audience to all join her in some small square at the top of the raised seats in the auditorium. Everyone goes up there. It is very crowded. I stay below at an aisle landing and watch. I tell some woman in a wheelchair, like Arvonne, this is terrible to have this inaccessible experience when it is presented by people with disabilities. As I sit there and watch, I realize that if I really wanted to, I could get there and join them if I wanted to. I realize I just don't want to and I let go of my complaints.

"This dream occurred at my home where a deserter from the army was now hiding. This soldier was the same young man I had dreamed about the night before. Our fruit cellar seemed to be very well stocked. In fact, it was overcrowded. We were living in our basement recreation room and using the fruit cellar for a bomb shelter. Outdoors bombs were being dropped, but the only visible damage was the presence of huge holes in the streets. There were road blocks at close intervals along the street and I was unsuccessfully trying to push my grandfather's large two-wheeled cart down the middle of the road. This seemed to be piled high with cabbages of all things, which weren't in the best condition. During this time, the blond lad was hiding in the house peering from the front window of the bedroom which was mine while I was in high school. All day he sat there focusing my dad's binoculars on the enemy soldiers who were patrolling the five points in front of our house. Only at night did he leave the house. At this time we would go for walks together.",Negative

"It's a rather confused dream for me. I was walking around my house with a friend who is the same age as I and whom I frequently see. We arrived to the door of my house and I went in, but she didn't. When I went in, I found another friend who was waiting for me to go see a ship, but we had to wait till the maid arrive because nobody was home and I had to leave word of where I was going. I don't remember exactly who the maid was, but everything looked familiar. It was my own house. But I don't know how, when we went out the door, there was a bunch of gentlemen of around 40 or 50 years who were waiting for us to get into the ship. My friend got in, but I couldn't because I said I felt uncomfortable with the clothes I had on and I asked them to wait for me to change. This time I went into a house that was on a second story, while mine is on the first, as though it were mine. I ran up the stairs and saw my mother and father who were asking me where I was going. I told them that I had been invited and that I had to change into slacks. I went into my room, and it was just as it is, except that for some reason I couldn't find the clothes that I was looking for, especially the shoes. I spent hours desperately trying to find them until I realized that my father had left some shoes he had bought for me on top of the dresser. There were many shoes, but in different sizes, all the same color and shape, and to my surprise, I realized that they were the ones I used in school. I put them on, but I realized that they did not have any straps to tie them, so I desperately searched everywhere until I found a pair of old shoes underneath my sister's bed and took the straps out and put them on mine. At that moment two girls about my age came up; one had black hair and the other brown, and they told me to hurry, that they had been waiting for me for quite a while. I don't know either of them. The brown-haired one stood at the bottom of the stairs and the black-haired one came up to the top of the stairs and stood there. My mother went over to talk to her and I felt very uncomfortable. I felt that the clothes I had on were bothersome and that they didn't match. I saw myself uncombed and in disarray. In contrast, the black-haired girl had a party dress on and my mother told me she was very pretty. Then we descended the stairs and I saw a ship at the door of my real house (not the one on the second story). It was a war ship and the heads of the gentlemen I had previously seen were sticking out from it. I don't know if I went inside or not because at that moment everything became blurry or I don't remember what happened.",Negative

"First episode takes place at top of Kent's hill in my hometown. I am standing on east side of cement sidewalk probably watching for a train. A girl or young lady walks up behind me (to my right). she is carrying a child, perhaps 2 1/2 to 3 years old on her shoulder. Sex of child uncertain, but probably male. The lady cranes her neck this way and that, apparently on look out for some person. The child is now being held by another girl who is standing next to wooden fence several steps or yards to north of my position. The baby falls from a fence post, head first into the area of the pasture, it's feet sticking straight upward and its skirts up around its head. Lady next to one calls my attention to the child's tumble, but makes no move to pick it up. A lone engine approaches. It is a small, 10-wheeler remindful of a switch engine.

"In my dream I see my recently married cousin, girl age 24, walking down my street supported by two other girls. I recognize one as being another one of my cousins. They are walking very slowly and approach our house. My mother and I are standing on the porch. We greet them. I ask my cousin how she is feeling and she responds that she feels well. I remember thinking to myself that I was so glad she was well and that now perhaps she would be able to keep her baby. All thou leave soon thereafter and they continue to walk very slowly down the street. All of a sudden she (the one who is to have a baby) appears to be suspended in air with her toes pointing toward the ground. I remember thinking: well, if she can do that she is all right. Interpretation At a family tea held Friday night I inquired if the cousin mentioned in my dream were going to be there.

"I was at the McDonald's on Beaufort street, except it was different and I was in America. Rover was also with me. There were lots of dogs there and they all looked very similar to Rover. It was very busy, and I found a seat outside at a little table with an umbrella. I saw Harvey Keitel walking around and he had this weird ring on his little finger. He came over to me and said something and chuckled. He was talking to me for a while and then we talked about Rover. I think I came back a second time and he was there again. This time I was trying to point out which one was Rover but I couldn't tell. He said 'you couldn't even tell which one's your dog' and I said 'yes I can, I just haven't found him yet'. When I did find him, Keitel made Rover follow him into this truck and took off. I tried to chase it, but it was too fast. I think I then 'woke up' and kept reciting the dream in my head, especially the fact it was at McDonald's Beaufort street, but in America. Then it kept like melding between reality and the dream. There was a picture of me, Fletcher, Tristan and Frederick where we were in a room and had posed in positions that were also reflected in the mirrors, so there were 2 of us. Except for Frederick, who was in the window. We were talking in a group on Facebook and Fletcher posted a link to all these notes I'd written which had been private and I had no idea how he got them. One was a list of the guys in my class from one year, ranked in attractiveness and other things like that. I deleted it and was like wtf. I had a message from Mason on Facebook, to a group we were in but I didn't remember being in that group, and was complaining about a job he got put on which was putting bottle caps onto bottles, which he implied I was also on. Then I was on a job with Hugo, who looked younger and shorter and because I knew it was a dream world [I wasn't lucid, I'm not really sure what it was] I tried to change him to look like he normally does. But he kept noticing his height changing so I was trying to be subtle about it. Then we were trapped where we were and needed to stay somewhere. There was this school place with dorms that we could stay in. The guy one had a lot of bunk beds around the walls, but no-one was sleeping on the top ones. We soon discovered it was because of this horrendous wind that came blowing every now and then. It was blowing as I left that one to go the girl one. The girl room was a lot smaller and had less beds. There weren't any free, so I had to wait for a new one.",Negative

"I'm standing by a large swimming pool. There are dozens of naked young women swimming in it, hanging around the sides, etc. But all are skinny-dipping. It turns out it's not just girls, because this is an experimental school run by a guy that looks like George Carlin. He says he didn't tell them to do anything: he just provided the pool and most of them (not all) just swam without clothes. After a confused part, most of the people are gone, and now I'm hanging around the pool with Andy, Melanie, the mousy blonde girl from Hillside Market, and a few other people. The women and a couple guys are now swimming around au naturel. Something happens regarding the house nearby; at any rate, it's time for people to sleep. Everybody got sleep but me, because while I'm sleeping, this hick guy and his dogs (everyone knows him) comes along and needs a place to stay. But actually this paragraph isn't right: I don't remember why I don't sleep. At the end, everybody is hanging out, discussing this problem in the main room, and I mention to Jimmy the fact I got no sleep. He says something cryptic: ""Well, at least you got the *Calypso*!"" and raises his eyebrows, looks around conspiratorially, and rubs his hands. Apparently he's referring to the nude girls. I'm not amused. I think, I could have done without the naked girls; I needed sleep. I could have *dreamed* them. I particularly remember having this last thought. Another fragment of this dream I cannot place, besides the hick guy and his dogs, is this: the experimental school got shut down. Naked people were too much for the authorities, it seems.",Negative

"We were at Fort Washington and Mom was saying last time we were here we had a big fight. And I was swimming around and it was getting gray, and I came back to them and they said there is distressing news in the air, there is distressing news. And, of course, I thought that my distress was finally known to them. And it was really that there was a storm coming, and so because there was a storm coming, we headed home. And I had the notion that we were driving Grandpa and Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce in our car, which we went to lunch with them yesterday, so that's probably it. But we only drove Grandpa. And we dropped Grandpa off at his house, but then we brought Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce home. I ran in and we had this porch that wasn't screened in, and it was like one of those laundry room porch things that had all kinds of junk on it and I had the notion that my room was on this porch. My bed was there, a bunch of my stuff was there, I had a dresser there, and on top of that dresser the keyboard was still sitting on top of that dresser. And I had a mixer of the same design, with the same red faders, and kind of funky LED display and kind of funky design. I had a mixer the exact design, and they like went together like a set, and they were both sitting on top of my dresser. And I knew that Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce were going to come in, so I put a towel over them so they wouldn't see them. And I don't remember too much more. Let me think a minute. And, oh yeah, in my dream they both worked, but before Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce were supposed to come in, for some reason I ran in the house. The system was on to sound like people were home. I ran in the house and turned it up a little and then I came back outside to see Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce. And it was like you could hear it out there. It was like I ran in and turned it on.

We decided to go to a different theater, however, because we didn't like the looks of the movie much. The next thing I remember was something about a war on cigars by the Europeans. It seems that they liked being able to travel with lower air fares, but that they didn't like cigar smokers on the planes. I guess I read this.

In it, he was trying to get a girl who seemed to be his sister to leave a wild party ""gang-bang."" I remember him singing. The singing and music were good and I thought that it would do well because it would appeal to all girls who wished they had an older brother to protect them.

They had knocked the house down. These garbage guys said they'd been doing disposals for two people and something happened twice in 20 years (can't remember). Someone had been mean.,Positive
"I was watching this movie with Jason Lee in it. I had read that it was about a guy who wasn't interested in women, but was interested in his 10 year old daughter. But I don't think it was. He was driving a car and his daughter (played by Dakota Fanning) was in the back. She said ""Dexter?"" and Jason said ""Yes, that's my name. Dexter Morgan"" and I thought of Michael C. Hall and then that everything Jason Lee was in recently he was called Dexter. I was saying that I know him as Beaver from Dreamcatcher. Her grandma gave her ""shackles"" which were people who ""gave off good vibes"".",Positive

"The Borrowed Canoe  I'm in the Big Resort Area with my friend Kevin Simpson. We seem to not have a canoe. There is a canoe with a long foam yoke in the water. We're going to use this canoe. It belongs to a man, and he will let us use it. It is an aluminum canoe with a dent, but it will work. The man takes a lot of photographs. The man seems to do some target shooting: there is a hole-filled target there. I am going to give him collateral for the canoe, so I look for my old Discover credit card that I've never used. I don't find it, but do find another credit card made of clear plastic. The man lives in Oak Valley, he says, and I tell him I'm also from there. He lives by MCI, which I know to be Roadside Company, down near the apartments next to the Dirty River. His last name is Aldger, and his middle name is Marshall. My middle name is Marshall too, I say. I consider not returning the canoe to him. There are chunks of ice on the water. Kevin and I are heavily packed. Kevin is trying to shovel snow with a plant holder. We're going to Oval Lake (which in real life is Fly Lake, I know).",Positive

Nancy has on a see-thru blue blouse (light and airy) and a Navy-blue skirt. She has dark brown hair--between chestnut and brunette. It is sort of upswept, a little like Gibson Girl. Joe is thin and sharp-nosed, a little like William Powell in Thin Man series--no hairline, mustache--both look about 35 to 40. He speaks first, ""I'm hungry."" And I said, ""Go to an Eastern Airline cafeteria. If line is too long, break in at front, if no line, start a new one."" Nancy looks at me and says, ""So this is what professors are wearing these days."" I have on a brown suit and tie. Mother and Dad have extra seats.

Nancy is cool and correct, not revealing plans.",Positive
"The setting was scenes of advertising layouts and determining their appropriate slots. In their commercial use, most of the advertisements were such as hamburger, coke, these usual, everyday advertisements. These layouts were in certain phases of production. Some of them were completed and others half completed and so forth. Upon completion they would be inserted into certain slots. Neither I nor anyone else was in the dream as far as being seen. The pictures all had their own distinct setup and position in the dream. There wasn't just a floating about of like flash card pictures of these different layouts. They seemed to be fixed in a certain position for a certain reason and there were empty spot that were waiting to be filled by probably predetermined advertisement or picture or whatever.

"I am sitting at round table in a departmental office with Jack Ramsay.  He is making preparations for his classes, and I am filing folders for test-takers, inserting new ones numerically into a batch which are already in order.

Says he wants to observe a class.  I tell him I don't have one because I am retired.  He says ""Welcome to the club.""  I take that to mean that he is retired too.   Next, all those guys are gone, and Patrice Pottier comes in and sits down at the table with some paper work of her own.  I ask her if she can help me by inserting just two folders into a section which I give her.  She says, ""What, do they not want you to have a heart attack from overwork or something?""   Although she is smiling when she says it, I take it as an indication that she sees the request as an imposition, and I am kind of taken aback.

"Me (and two other people I don't know) were at a baseball stadium, where the park at my old house was. After something we were watching there, a big electronic billboard announced ""Here they come."" Suddenly big dinosaurs were running out of the big doors at the side of the stadium. Everyone started running, because being chased by dinosaurs at the end of any event was a sport people enjoyed. We had to run out of the stadium and turn around a pole 12 times before running home. While I was running to the poles, an Ankylosaurus (I was looking through his eyes at the same time) looked at someone near me and said to a Tyrannosaurus ""I'll take the one in the blue shirt, you take the boy in the green.""

"We bought a boat, and we took the boat on a trailer down and put it in the water. There were several other boats in the water. Started up the boat. Drove off down these channels, like between land, and we were going in single file with other boats. We were going fast. I think our boat was a used boat, but it was pretty good at the price we paid for it. We passed some other boats. The only boats that passed us were bigger and more expensive boats. We is myself, my wife and my mother. We beached the boat. We had a picnic, and we discussed the merits of the various boats. We decided that ours was a good one for the money and we were quite happy with our boat. My wife and my mother purchased the boat, and they told me that they had looked at some that were cheaper. I think the price was 9.95, a used boat and a new one was more expensive, something like 22.95. But the one they had, I think, was about 12.95. Anyway, I liked the boat. I was quite satisfied with the boat. When we left the dock area, we drove the boat out the channel between two pieces of land. They seemed to have rather, you know, stone sea walls. There were high trees along the water edge, and this channel wasn't straight out to the ocean. It went at right angles kind of out. When we got back, I got in an argument with a man over the merits of an Evinrude over a Johnson. I was all for the new Johnson with an inboard and outboard drive. He thought just the outboard alone was pretty hot stuff. These canals were actually quite long. This canal was a continuous canal with a lot of turns and much of the time I recall was spent driving the boat down these canals. The boat was an open boat, somewhere between 16 and 18 feet, I would say, and it had one of those inboard-outboard drives. You could tell this because it had a box in the back rather than an outboard motor hanging out.",Positive

They came through and they were poking through the weeds with a stick and they just barely missed the top of our heads. It was a good thing that we were crouched down far enough. Fortunately they couldn't see us. And most people still believed that she had died. There were three men involved. The one man, the one who was the head of the ring, the worst character of the three, actually ended up dying. The other two ended up being hurt or injured or something because they ended up in the hospital. The one died and the other two recovered and did a complete turn around in their lives.

There were three of them and one was made of wood, another one of steel and the third one of glass. At one of the doors I saw a woman who was in black and who led me to the glass door. I kept seeing her and several women and beautiful crystals that had my face on them. Suddenly I disappeared and found myself in another place;I think it was a desert, and I had a terrible thirst and was hot, but I kept walking and found a town, and a lonely woman who saw that I was down and came to my help. She took me to her house and took care of me. I saw something in her which reminded me of the doors. I asked her if I had seen her before in that dark street, and she answered me that it wasn't her.

"There's something in this dream, there's a large city. I won't say for sure but it reminds me of Boston to some degree. It could be New York. It could be anyplace. I'm a Fuller Brush man again. This time selling very much in the center of a city, apartments. The dream started when my boss picked me up to take me to my area to sell. I remember I parked my car, met him, and he took me a couple of miles through the city. He wants to go down expressways to this area that I was to sell in. In his car he had 2 daughters about 4 or 5 years of age. I can't remember too much of the details of the actual selling. It didn't seem as if it were too successful though. As I say, I was in apartment houses. After it was all over, I met him again and we started back. I remember he was telling me not to be too worried about the way I did because that area was quite hard to sell in any way. Then we started back on some expressway. We reached a very large hill and started down it. I remember he put the brake on to slow ourselves down because he was going about 70 miles an hour going down this hill. Just as he put the brake on, he seemed to almost just collapse. He moved forward and hit his head on the windshield, then just slumped down in the seat. Well, this threw the car out of control. I remember I didn't panic at all. I just merely reached over and grabbed the wheel. I kept us going straight. Then I had to push myself over on the seat and somehow managed to get him out of the way so I could get a hold of the brake pedal. This took a while, but I finally reached it and just as I was beginning to put the brake down to slow us down I woke up. I just might mentioned a few other things. The car we were driving was a '55 Ford. This is not the car that Moss has. He has a Corvair. Also the hill we were going down is certainly no place in Boston or no place else I've ever seen before. This is a monstrous hill. In front of us there were 2 trucks, so if we had gone out of control, it would have been quite bad. The daughters in the front seat, they were also in the front seat with me. There were 4 of us in the front seat, and they were frightened, but not too frightened. I guess that's about all. A few more things I remember about the dream. It was really cold, which was another thing that made me think it was a northern city. Also we were going down this hill, I can remember I was trying to get the car into neutral also. I don't know why, but I sort of tried to do it without the clutch too--just tried to pull the gear shift lever into neutral. It was a standard shift car. As for emotions in the dream, I would say it was fairly neutral even right up to the point where we were going down this hill. I can remember when this first happened. I thought what a terrible situation we were in, but then I controlled myself. I just said, ""Don't panic."" I just calmly tried to grab the wheel and push my boss out of the way so I could get to the brake pedal.",Negative

"A Room With Melanie  I'm with my friend Matt Yams. He is telling me about something that happened at his place of employment, The Greasepit. The cash register broke and the lights went out. Money was stolen. People came back at 3:00 am to get the money. Matt had waited for them, but had not waited long enough. Matt and I are near the American Legion building in Oak Valley. He puts some videos from Hollywood Video, and I put some strips of my stratographic column from Historical Geology, into a manhole cover.  I am in a bedroom with my friend Melanie McDyss. We are each in a single bed on opposite sides of the room. My stratographic column is in a shoebox with a slit cut in the top of the box. I need to get the column out and cut it up according to each formation, leaving two inches between each section. I take them out of the box and start cutting. There are two windows by my bed, which is in a corner of the room. One window is at the head of the bed, and I pull that shade down. The other window is left side of the bed, and it has no shade. There is another bed in the room. In the bed are my dad, sister Heather, and another person, who may be my brother Wally. They have sex. My dad is behind someone having anal intercourse with them. Someone defecates. When they do, I have the feces in a light brown, brimmed, safari-type hat. The hat is upside down and the feces are in the bowl portion of the hat. I run to the bathroom and take the feces out of the hat and put them in the toilet. The water in the toilet is tainted yellow from urine. I rinse the feces off my fingers in the toilet. Then I rinse my fingers in some water that is left in the bottom of a shower stall. I realize that some feces came out of my penis when I was masturbating. I hope Melanie didn't see this. When I am in the bathroom, I notice my skin is really dry, and has white patches on it. I put water on my skin and the white patches go away. I go back to bed. It is 11:10 on one clock, and 11:11 on the other. I see a man from my bed. The scene seems to be at home in Oak Valley. I see him sitting at the kitchen table as I look down the stairs. I see that he is the man from my Astronomy class that always drinks Arizona Tea. His name may be Damien. He is arriving home. It is as if he is my brother Wally. He goes to the basement. I am in my sister Ramona's room. Melanie gets up and goes to the storage closet in the room to urinate. I am awake, and I see her. She doesn't see me. She has a big bag packed for her trip to Chicago. She curses the big bag. It is on her back as she moves, making her clumsy. In the bedroom is a van that I put on the floor by my bed.

He's a big, scruffy biker man with dark hair and facial hair, wearing a ripped black Harley Davidson tank top under a blue flannel shirt.

Then I past that other Darren guy playing tennis by himself, and he hit one backwards and almost hit me.",Negative
A druggist made a new advertising display about ten feet by twenty feet. A heating pipe partly obscured the sign. He only had room on the sign for his telephone call letters (two letters). His call letters were UNITY. Later I borrowed a manikin from the druggist. I had to climb a wall to return it. A woman complained that the head was not right. I said I would buy another one.,Positive
"My mom was baking me a B-day cake and she, Lori and I were going to celebrate. Nan and Jan, my mom's boyfriend's two daughters, showed up as we were lighting the candles. They said they needed a ride somewhere. We all got in the car to take them where they needed to go. Jan got out of the car and went inside a house. We were sitting in the car waiting for her. I got out of the car and started kicking it, screaming, ""This is bullshit! It's my birthday! Can't you guys find someone else to chauffeur you around?"" Then my dad was there and he was bitterly angry with me. He said, ""Now I know what Lori was talking about, I see how you are."" I said that I was sorry but he wouldn't listen to me.",Negative
"The bus in which my mother and I were going had stopped working. We had to get off. It looked like a town in the mountains. The houses were made of stone, with inclined roofs, and it was very cold. We covered ourselves with blankets, and we walked about one block, and we stopped and found a man with a brown muffler and a suit of the same color who was smoking. He brought us to a door. It looked like a house, and when we opened we saw it didn't have a roof and it looked like a bazaar. There were several women selling food and drinks, and drunk men. Others were dancing. The door was closed and we couldn't get out. My mother went over to a woman and asked her for something hot, which she took, and then she became very pale. It seemed as though she were paralyzed; she couldn't walk. Suddenly a big noise was heard and the people started to scream with horror. They opened the door and I had to carry my mother on my back because she couldn't walk and she seemed to be drugged. When we got out, the floor seemed to be covered with mud, which ran like a river and was hot so that when we walked, our feet were burned. I couldn't run because of my mother's weight. I had to go up some stairs until I finally reached the top and I was near a truck. I got my mother in it and I waited for more people to come, then the truck started by itself, I don't know how, and we crashed. We fell into an abyss, but there was nobody there. My mother wasn't there; there were only a bunch of rocks.",Negative
"I was in a big shopping centre and it was about 5.30pm because all the shops were closing. I was looking for something to eat, but everything I thought looked good was closing. I left and there were some guys outside looking bored. I didn't have shoes on and it was really hot outside and I couldn't remember where I parked. I heard them talking as I was walking and they were saying they should rape me. I tried moving faster, but they caught me and the leader held me down on the ground pulling down my pants. I struggled and he punched me. He had sex with me and then got up to give the next guy a turn, but they got distracted by something and I got up and found my car. I got in and turned it on as they noticed I was gone. I drove out and was trying to go fast, but there were all these roadworks in place. There was a narrow bridge with almost no barriers and I went off the edge straight into the water. I rewound it and went back and drove super slowly. A family that lived nearby ushered me onto this platform and took me into their house. The place nearby had been flooded, hence the roadworks and bridges. We realised we had to hide my car and the only way was to sink it and I was upset about this and was trying to decide whether I'd rather them find me or lose my car, but decided to lose the car. The guy went out to sink it and they were trying to find all these materials to use for something but I said we'll freeze without them. I was worried the guys would find me regardless and then I'd lose my car as well.",Negative
"In the dream I'm living in Germany, perhaps with my friend Sal. I have a job with a large organisation, which seems to be the only employer in this small town. I can't work out what they do. There are various jobs to do there - like waitressing, cleaning, pool cleaning, attending rides in an enormous amusement park. I've worked out this is some kind of tourism company that's employing me. This whole town seems to be one big money-making machine for milking tourists. My boss is a guy who was really by boss about 10 years ago. In real life he was a good guy - perhaps he is trapped here too. In the dream he seems to have become hardened - like a gangster almost - handing out rough treatment to his many employees. His office is large and scruffy. It is almost empty - it looks like he has the whole floor of a large office block to himself. He sits at a desk with papers all over it, signing employment contracts. When he sees me he smiles, but his smile seems double-edged (not genuine). Back in town, I'm aware that the town is like a trap or a maze. Once you're inside, it's almost impossible to find your way out. There are rides that take you through the streets, that weave in and out of a three dimensional spaghetti jumble of tourist shops, garish signs and cartoony fibreglass models. It seems people don't even have the freedom to walk anywhere - you have to travel on rides. They are like little bumper cars or roller-coaster cars. Behind the bright plastic and lights, if you look carefully, you can make out the workers - slightly depressed looking people in something like McDonald's  uniforms with caps. They look greasy and dirty and bored. They are mostly immigrants. This is a dirty and sickening place.",Negative
"I strayed into a beautiful region under the northern slope of Mount Ida, shady ravines, clear brooks and cascades. How it all found room between Newtonville Avenue and the railroad, I did not trouble to explain. Walking east, I followed a stream which must have been a tributary of a larger one. Presently I saw a spring issuing from a cleft in the ledges, and at the same moment discovered that I had a companion for whom I wanted to get a drink of water. A large tin cup conveniently developed in my hand and I climbed ten or fifteen feet to fill it. But to my annoyance, the cup expanded to a bathtub containing lumps of black loam and enormous earth roundworms. While I was rinsing it out, I woke.",Negative

Characters: This girl and I just never got along. I don't know why. She was in my house, but I hated her. She was the only character. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, hate. I'm trying to grow out my hair so I know why I felt so mad and helpless. I would kill her if it really happened.",Negative

It then occurs to me that I might now be responsible for their murder.",Negative
"(02/04/01)[""Dreams.""] I am at a person's house. We are having a meeting of the dream group, a group of women. We are going to decide on what structures we will agree on for when we do dreamwork. We convene and a medical doctor is here especially to help us work out our structure. I welcome him. Then I read from a typed list of suggestions made so far. A student from a University makes one suggestion. Howard has another. It is about things coming from the same part of the brain and you must focus on that area. I have a question about whether or not the title or the date should be written first. A long fancy letter from a group called Lovely(Thing? Thoughts? moments?) from Arizona is talking about what they do as a group. Now we are preparing for the potluck meeting. The room is small and square and up one half level. I put some kind of food on the table. Someone knocks on the door. I walk down to the large living room and across it to the door. I let in a women. I walk back toward the dream room. Another knock. This repeats a number of times as couples, well dressed and women come in with lots of food. I realize there will not be enough room for everyone in the small room, so I contemplate moving it into the living room. The owner of the house is somewhere in the kitchen. The phone rings. I say hello but the woman at the other end can't hear me. She is confused. Apparently she was trying to call The Emporium. I keep trying to speak to her. Later another woman asks me if the higher level rooms are accessible. I say no, they aren't. I am not real happy with all these couples. (I am reminded of the my discussion circle group.)",Positive

"I was drawing the banister on the outdoor steps at the House of Representatives. The rail connected the tops of the vertical post and was attached to a window, the 2nd tall skinny window on the right, of swirly architectural style. Sidney came up and it was time for him to fly the jet. It was a futuristic jet and would do loop de loops and go real fast. I rode with him and was looking down below at the trees. We passed peach trees so I assumed we were in South Carolina. I could tell they were peach trees because of the shape of the leaves. We passed over an orchard of unidentified fruit trees. The fruit was round like grapefruit but white like it had been under a rock. The sphere fruit was hanging. There was a loose prescription bottle with loose Prozac in there and 2 Clonodine. The Clonodine were pink and white capsules which were suppose to appease withdrawal and induce sleep by lowering the blood pressure. I took the jet up but I didn't go that high because I knew I had to get back to ground level. I was doing artwork in 305 and a teacher pushed in the door with about 30 students. They were Orthodox Greeks. The man made an inside joke about Orthodox Greeks but I didn't get it. I don't even know what that is. He proceeded to tell me but I still didn't get it. The girl at the fast food check out was talking to people in line. She said, ""May I take your order please.......... next........... may I take your order please................. next............. may I take your order please......... next......... may I take your order please?

I said, ""Well you've got those rolls and you've got an oven, 2 + 2 = 4, just toast instead of hamburgers. She gave me plain raw bread. I took it and quietly sat down.

At lunch Calvin, Eugene, others and I were in the room. We realized no-one else was there and I said ""where is everyone?"" and Eugene said ""I dunno"". We walked out and everyone was sitting in chairs and a guy was talking. Ms Solomon gave us gel stuff to put everywhere there was hair. It made my hand look nicer. I was naked and she was putting it in my hair and I was covering myself. I was looking in a mirror and I let go and saw my boobs and quickly covered back up. Some guy with a really squished up face said hello to Calvin (first, we were in a tree along with Spaceman and had gone to run away and I had trouble getting down). He had annoyed Calvin last year but obviously didn't get in trouble for it. He kept hurting him and me to a lesser extent. He was trying to drown me at one point. I went into a room to hide.

When she was done, I remembered that I hadn't conditioned my hair or anything, so I went back in. When I got out of the shower for the 2nd time, all the boys were there.

There were these things which flew into your mouth, 'rape' you and give you a funny feeling in your stomach and then you die. I think I was an alien.

My lawyer, who is black, and reminds me of Robert from my music class, does not question anyone. So, it is the prosecution's turn. I am sworn in. The judge talks to me. Between the first witness and myself there is a recess. Kids play baseball with a blow-up bat and ball. Everyone scrambles to regain composure as the judge is about to re-enter the courtroom. I scramble too, and my feet fly off the floor at one point. I am being charged with Assault 200. The maximum penalty for that is 9 years in prison. I was driving a boat while drunk, and I hit a car that was towing a boat. There were no injuries. I hit the car on the passenger side.

When I do this, I am in my back yard at home, and the jury is on the roof of my house! I tell them I don't remember much because I was drunk. I tell them I was in downtown Wilmerton in the large parking lot across from the Perkins and the movie theatre. I was driving drunk and I knew authorities were near. At this point I am swinging on a tire swing in my back yard drinking a beer. I say that what I am on trial for was a dream. I say to the jury: ""I don't know if you all believe in dreams, but I do. I've been journaling them for four or five years."" I say it is concrete evidence. Then I think to myself, ""A dream as concrete evidence?""

I suggest that we have a throwing contest, which pleases the boy, who is eager to display his ability. The parking in center of street is bare (no grass or shrubs) but there are a good many small stones lying about. I search for some stones suitable for throwing, but all I can find are either too small and irregular in shape, or they are entirely too large and heavy.

"Gang Rape  A woman is being raped. It looks like she is accepting of the sexual intercourse, but it is rape. It is as if the man says, ""I am going to rape you."", and she has no choice in the matter. She unbuttons her dress and gets down on all fours. The man tells her to spread her butt cheeks. She does. I see her vagina clearly. He licks her vagina, giving her cunnilingus, and nips, almost as if biting her clitoris. He then penetrates her. Other men are with him. They rape her when he is done. Two children see this. It is a tragedy, but it seems to happen willingly: the woman doesn't struggle and the people watching don't help. Next I see the woman in the hospital. She is naked. Her legs are spread open. She has been raped.",Negative

"Up -- you know how in the landing of the stairwell here -- there's a little round table that the old CC TV has been kind of placed on, and I like have been using it from time to time. Well, in my dream, standing on top of the monitor was a big, huge, about 4' tall -- and almost as tall as me -- it was a Santa display figure doll thing, and it was standing on top of the CC TV monitor. And you would activate it and it would just sway. It was supposed to like dance, but when he spread his arms, it was like this big, huge mess, just swaying and swaying and kind of making a noise and flashing some lights and playing a little Christmas song. But I would get nervous about this thing falling off because it would sway so wide, and I didn't really think it was going to fall off, I just thought it might. And that's really all I can remember. I think I was going to take it to a party or something, but I don't remember anything.... Now I remember some more about this dream. It had no connection to the Santa thing, but I dreamt that we were walking from an apartment in N______ Park over to the campus, and it was sort of a nice walk. I mean, we were seeing roses and stuff. But I was living upstairs in kind of a dingy place, and it was kind of small and blah, and so we were on this walk, showing me the way to Modern Media College, and next thing I know, I'm back home at this house messing with that Santa thing again. I don't get it.",Negative

"Looking for someone. Rang the bell upstairs. Wanted #19 but from the pencil scrawls on the door couldn't make out how to ring for that number. Hearing voices within, called to ask how to ring for #19. Girl who opened the door told me I had to put money in the slot before I could get a number. I asked, ""How much?""

"Sex With Brianna  I'm in a bedroom with my classmate Brianna Eggert, friend Hank Anderson, Hank's grandpa, roommate Stephen Ramos, sister Ramona, and others. We are all about to go to bed. I'm on one side of a large bed. Brianna is in the middle of that bed, and Stephen is on the other side. It's hot in the room. I take off most of my clothes and sleep with my brown corduroy pants on. Brianna sleeps half naked as well. We all lay in bed. I have my hand on Brianna's stomach in a nonchalant way. I want to have a sexual encounter with her, but I don't want to be too assertive. She moves my hand to her breast. I start to rub and suck her breasts. I don't want Ramona, who is in the room, to know I'm doing this. I move my hand down and touch Brianna's crotch, rubbing her clitoris with my finger. I awaken, and am sitting up not in or near a bed. My hand is in some crusty or crumb-like bird-food substance. I smell my fingers, which don't really smell like a vagina, but smell a little different.",Positive

It was going around down a road and he took a shortcut to head it off, but couldn't make it. Then there was an image of him or a double in the car. The car made a stop at the bottom of the hill and when Ray came near, his double or image of him, the image disappeared in thin air. I picked up something.

He said he'd go inside and look for them, and come back later.",Positive
"I was with my mother in a taxi and we were going to a movie. We met a blonde and rather fat girl and since she was in a hurry, she started to drive herself. She knew the route very well, and the driver liked the idea and gave her his seat. We got to the movies. Next to it was a store. In it they sold stuff for hair care. I asked for a couple of things and put one of them in the bag I was carrying, without meaning to keep it, but the salesgirl didn't see it that way, I think. We went into the movie theater, which was very nice, and we sat in the front rows. In the movie I saw an actor I like very much and I don't remember any more.",Positive
"I am with a large group of people and we are visiting a resort town. I am tired and want to rest before going to the casinos. I am in a large, open field and lie down to rest, either on a cot, or on the ground. All of the people in my group are nearby, in another large field. They promise to wait until after I have had my rest when we'd all go together to the casinos. When I awaken after resting, I'm clad only in my underwear shorts. I go to the other field only to discover that my friends are gone. I'm very upset. But some other people tell me not to worry, that my friends will return soon. This calms me down. I look into the field and see a small ditch in which Mary is sitting, or kneeling. I see her face in profile and she is smiling. She is not looking directly at me.  To get a better view of her, I kneel down beside Mary. The dream ends.",Negative
"An Itemized Statement  I get my master card bill for $381. It is already paid. I'm at the bank talking to a woman about my bank statement, which is my credit card bill. My statement doesn't have my itemized checks and deposits: they are all photocopied onto the back of the statement. The name on the statement is Eugene B Filse. I want an itemized statement, but my name doesn't seem to be on it, and everything is fuzzy. The woman says that I wrote too many checks in too little time, and that they are sloppy. My mom is there. I am angry! I ask the woman angrily if it is because I wrote too many checks in too little time, or if it because they are sloppy. I ask this knowing that the question is dumb, and that it really doesn't matter. The woman gets defensive and bluntly asks what she can do for me. I say loudly and sternly, ""I want some good answers!"" I sand up abruptly with contempt for her. I crumble up the paper with contempt. My mom is upset because of my behavior. She follows me out of the bank. I see my high school classmate Todd Warden as I walk away, and I think this is the first time I've seen him since his father died.",Negative
"I am all dressed up in a lovely gown, waiting for my date to arrive. There are children and Melinda in the room. My young man comes to the door. I am excited and pleased. He is very good-looking and well groomed and dressed. I go to the coat closet to get a coat. I am taking special pains to dress socially acceptable as opposed to my usual bid for comfort before fashion style. I pick a coat and realize it is Melinda's. She s miles her consent at me. I put it on. A scarf goes with it, very 1950's in style. We leave, feeling happy.",Positive

"This dream took place in the water. Two sisters wanted to be mermaids. So they turned into mermaids, but one of the sisters really wanted to have her sister's legs, so she took them. She returned them to their rightful owner after she was done using them. One of my sorority sisters whom I haven't seen in a while was also in my dream. She was telling me she was going to school in another state, and I told her that I had family there. I felt uncomfortable talking to her and I could sense tension between us. We had been taking care of some babies as we were talking and I felt like she didn't like me, or had something against me.",Negative

"I was at 'school'. Some of my classes were with Ezra. They had light blue shirts with a giant paw print on them. Then, Mom (although she seemed different) and I found a way to go back in time. We had to like run through a field. In the middle of the field, I had to grab this rope and pull myself along the grass (I was lying down on it). It was hard to do. Then I was somewhere else, in some water. There were men there from say, the 1800's and were pirate/captain-y like. They were also in the water and they couldn't see me, but could feel me and so I had to make sure they didn't touch me. They walked near me and I went under the water. This cat was watching me. They followed the cats stare and saw me lying on the bottom of the water, but they actually saw me as a black bear. Then I was in a room, near the door. A friend of Mom's was coming over and she told me to say that I was her sister. I looked through the side of the door (where the hinges join) and saw a girl standing in the hall. She asked who I was and Mom said ""my sister"". A while later I took my clothes off to do something. Then Santiago, Mom and Darren came in and I asked Mom for a shirt. Then, I was outside somewhere. Charlie (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) and Liam McPoyle (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) were there. We were messing around. Charlie was in some water and Liam was being creepy. Charlie was going to chase me, so I ran. I ran into this castle like place and was trying not to laugh, but I was also worried about him catching me. I tried to lock the front door but it was too hard so I ran around the corner into a hallway for the toilet. I closed the first door, but it wouldn't lock, so I ran to the next door and tried to lock it. It wouldn't lock at first, but then it did. But, it was low down and there were cubicles of toilets behind me. Someone came in and it was Liam. He looked over the top. I was fairly exhausted by this point and said ""Nooo, I need to pee!"". I couldn't stop thinking 'Rose Red!' when I saw him. I'm not sure what this was, but there was a car crash. The guy ran out to protect his girlfriend and then the car blew up. Then she saw 'herself' run to the car to save her boyfriend. They were dead, but didn't know that.",Negative

Beckett said, ""I'll not move--here for many years and I'll not change for a stupid new law."" Landlord starts out, but door to front locked with a cheap lock on inside.

When they are out of sight, I get up and run outside to try to find them. They are gone. I run around the house in bare feet looking on the roof. It is summer time. There is a brown station wagon there; different than the one we used to have. I think I might be dreaming, and I attempt to fly. I fall on my face. I keep running, and try again to fly with a strong will to fly. I start to fly. I go up in the air and try to maintain lucidity, but I lose it.",Negative

I thought I was awake listening to a Christmas Video/recording on the TV. When I thought I was opening my eyes I would see an animated video corresponding to the holiday song that was playing. I realized that they weren't playing all of any of the songs- that it must have been a commercial of some sort. I thought it was odd that they were playing this on TV in the middle of the year. Then I realized that I had put it in before I went to sleep. I was too groggy to get up and turn it off. I thought that maybe that is why Christmas had shown up.,Positive

"I was at CTS meeting with Felicity K. We were talking about my dissertation. Jack P arrived. I had invited him to be on my committee some time ago when I thought my topic was going to be spirit in the workplace. When he came in I was talking to him like nothing was wrong, all the time trying to figure out what to tell him or what to do. I felt bad that he had come here for nothing, because I couldn't have him on my committee now. I was explaining to him why I had invited him, saying that it was because I respected him and valued his opinion. Myself, Felicity K and some other people were working on some kind of project. We had to make some kind of a model out of heavy-duty electric extension cords. They weren't the typical orange colored ones however. They were dark colors like black and dark blue and such. I was having trouble doing much with mine. Felicity K had been successful but I don't remember now what hers was. I looked at someone else's and said, Oh. You've created a crown of thorns. They said no and told me what it was. It was round in shape and had a few of the old-fashioned sized Christmas lights standing up a bit here and there. I thought the lights represented the thorns.",Positive
Coming with R. to Fargo. Begin to unpack. There are two closets and two wardrobes. R. uses three leaving me only one closet. I object. We had been asleep and wakened. R. having begun to unpack the night before. See clearly rug and paper of my present room. Much confusion of furniture. Again displeased because R. has taken desk with desk lamps. Miss. La comes in. I call her attention to room so much nicer than we were here before. Try to move furniture about. R. says to wait for Jo. She remarks she doesn't want other relatives to visit. I object. Call to supper. Mother says to hurry. Down long confused stairway. (Strong emotional tone throughout.),Positive
"I was going to play a game with my housemate Andre, his girlfriend Suzie, and my boyfriend Jeremy.  Jeremy wasn't there.  Our friend Celia went to get him.  He was behind my parents' bed.  She came back and told me we had to talk in private.  I went back there and there was a cat and a chicken bleeding.  The chicken had human-like blood, but the cat's blood was clear red.",Positive
"I went out to a used car dealer who handled, I think, Studebakers and Volkswagens, a new car dealer who also had used cars. I kept thinking in the dream that I wanted to buy a used VW even though every once in a while I would realize that was not what I wanted to do. I wanted to get a 1960 compact or something like that. I went ahead and got a trade-in estimate on my car of about $795, which seems rather high now that I think of it. Then somehow I went ahead and paid the man what money I had with me to make up the difference on another car. Then I realized that was sort of stupid to go ahead and do then because I wasn't even sure that he would have the kind of car I wanted. But then I started looking at his used cars an he showed me a full-size 1960 car, 59 or 60 car, 4-door with an automatic transmission. Then he showed me a Willys and another car whose name I can't recall, except it was a very odd one. Both this car and the Willys were very strange because they looked very old-fashioned. They were open and like a surrey with a fringe on top. About at this point I started talking with my wife about a car that we needed. We were in my hometown at the time at my mother's home, although I don't think she's there, which is strange because we expect to buy this car in my wife's hometown at my wife's parents' home. We thought that we really wanted to look around some more to get a better idea, but we really didn't have time since we had to go home in a couple of days. So we'd probably go ahead and buy one off this car dealer's lot anyway.",Positive
"Terri was taking a photography class and she was learning all about different color compositions and stuff like that, and she was showing us a package of pictures that she took. And there were two or three pictures of Celine Dion, there were tons of pictures of flowers, there were one or two pictures or like sunsets and things, and I guess -- I don't know -- but I guess she was going to pay me to scan some of them for her. And I was telling her she didn't have to pay me, but the thing was that, oh, I know -- I asked her, ""How many pictures do you want, and what size?"" And I asked her how many. And she thought I was saying, ""How much are you going to give me?"" But she took quite an amount of time making up her mind which ones she wanted, and she just kept sitting there, thumbing through them and saying, ""Well, maybe this or maybe not, maybe not, maybe not,"" you know, like Mom does. And I got the mail, and this thing came in the mail, this funny envelope thing from Modern Media College and it was real classy. And it was this box. It said, ""2003-2004"" on it, and it was this box that was real pretty and real classy, and you just put things in it, I guess. And that was all there was to it. And I was noticing, as I looked at it, it kind of changed, and I noticed that on the bottom it said, ""Westport Town Center"" instead of ""_____ Park."" And there were little flowers and there was sort of an indention in the middle of it. And then I woke up.",Positive
"I return ""home"" to show something to Ellie and see Arvonne is out near the door. I am upset that I have to go past her and she will see me. I go past and show Ellie my long chain of linked key chains. She shows me hers of equal length. Arvonne shows hers. I am surprised she enters into the discussion. We all sit at a long table. Arvonne says, ""It's a good thing we've taken the afternoon because it will take lots of time for her to share all about her new boyfriend."" I think, ""Humm. Another one so soon. She's fast."" I take a sip of oxygen off a tube out of the wall because we are on another planet and we need oxygen. Merle comes and joins us. I notice he is thinner and better-looking. I ask him how he does something. He growls, ""That's personal. I won't tell you."" ""Well,"" I say, ""You sure are in a grumpy mood. What's so personal about that? I'd ask anyone that question."" I am aware that Arvonne had been ready to share and we were using the time focused on someone else. I felt badly.",Negative
"This time, it is not the popping of the tubes, but the whistling of the mortars themselves that alerts us. We run for the bunkers. They are not bunkers as such, but the cinder brick foundations to be seen during the early construction of a home. There is no roof, only a few pieces of lumber overhead; it is very, very open. The mortars begin to drop, I hear the explosions very clear. This part of the dream seemed the most real. I recall huddling in a corner, shifting positions, as I anticipate a direct hit amidst us. The mortars continue to fall.",Negative
"Granny had some underground thing with people they used to feed the poor. I saw her pouring oil and singing into the drains (it was night, in some spooky American like neighbourhood). Then Cartman (South Park) followed her and people who were sick got put on this big stone and cooked, there were about four there. Granny was there with other people. I was at a party like thing with Mom. Margarita came up to me and said something mean and I ignored it. Later there was a big cheesecake like cake and it was from KFC and had almonds. I showed it to Dad. It looked really fattening and this guy said it was $50. Hilarie Burton was actually from here, and her and some guy came back and were playing at the beach. Margarita came back to me and apologized and mentioned me having kissed Duane and said my secret was safe with her. I was now Haley (One Tree Hill) and she had a friend who could read minds. They called her and said she had dreamt that she was in a car and something bad happened. She said Nathan did that, but ignored it.

"My mother, father and fiancee went with me on a fishing trip. We stayed at a very old house somewhere in Kentucky. The house was half over water and was owned by hicks. We went fishing by tying strings around our finger and used pickles as bait. I caught a large catfish. The hicks told us the fishing was good because they made pickles and stored them in their basement which was in the water. The fish were attracted by the smell or flavor of the pickles and always stayed near the house.",Negative

"First of all, we were on the nature trail and we were walking along looking at different things -- Mom and me and my sisters, Samantha and Sandra, and Derek. And we were showing pictures in the picture album; we took a few more pictures. And then we came home, we stopped on the way home at like a big service merchandise store thing. And we looked around and we bought something that was like a DVD player, and some other boxes looked at it and then we decided we were going to buy it. So anyway, we bought it, and we got home and immediately when we brought it home, it was a VCR, and I took it out of the box and hooked it up to the amplifier as if I'd done it a hundred times, like I do with the the board. Then I took the closest video tape that I could find and put it in there to check it out, but I didn't even turn on the TV because all I was interested in was the audio. That was weird! And then Dad was coming in and I turned everything off so that he could turn it on and pretend that he was the first one to turn it on. And then I was with Brad and Randy and Mark from Home Improvement, trying to make them work something out, and showing them our family pictures. And then I woke up.",Negative

I find my old one and take pictures, but I am unsure of the exposure times and focus. I then find where my father has accidentally put my camera away in the living room closet. I use it now. I am now in a spacious bathroom where I lay down on a futon/chaise lounge thing to suntan. There is a choice of music, chips and crackers to eat. It is pleasant.

"I'm with my friend Ron and a couple of others - one is a contact of Ron's, and another is a friend of his, who is russian or from some eastern block country. This man is introduced as a fairly important politician or businessman in his country. I'm given the impression that he is a 'good guy' who is fighting for survival in a corrupt country. Apparently he has been left bankrupt by his government and has fled to Britain to recoup.  Ron's contact has pledged to invest some money in this russian guy. The russian guy is approaching me for the rest - a substantial amount like $30,000. I couldn't afford to give a stranger anything like this amount of money, however I'm charmed into thinking it would be the right thing to do to invest in him. The contact is talking him up as a good person to invest in. Ron stays out of it and remains neutral. We are having a meeting in a late-night bar which is almost empty. The streets are dark outside. The men turn up the pressure to get my money. I falter. He says he'd pay me back and has to go suddenly. I come to my senses when I realize I'm not investing - just lending. Later, I go outside to get by bike, which I had locked up. But some young guys in hoods have taken the wheel off and locked both parts with their own locks. They are still hanging around, so I confront them, with Ron behind me. I try to verbally threaten them but they are not intimidated and just laugh and start to walk away. One of them tries to get into a cab. I pull him back and fight them to the ground one by one. I get the guy who has the key to his locks and squeeze his thrombi until he submits and releases his grip on the key. I return to my bike, unlock it, put it back together and head off down the street with Ron. After a few streets we stop so Ron can call his sister from a phonebook, to ask her to pick us up.

We were joined by Ellen Walstein who was just getting off work for lunch.  She suggested we have lunch at ""Sardo's.""  It seems there were enough of us to require 2 cars.  As we walked to the cars, I could see our car (the Sunbeam) a block or more away, and pointed it out to Ellen.

I peeked out and Mom came out of the toilet. I asked if it was her that had been singing. She said no and then the bad guys appeared. I went back to my room and closed my door. They barged in. There were four guys and one girl (I think). One of the guys's decided that he didn't want to do this and he tried to push two of the guys out of the room. He couldn't and they set him on fire.

"I have (or some woman has) created a theatre or movie set. She puts on shows there, but this upsets a man and a woman in the next room/area. It's their stuff to do that and this upstart has taken over their space. They come after her. Then it's like the same story, but it's Warren Beatty that lives in a huge castle/mansion.

"I don't know exactly where to start because this was another one of those rambling saga-like type dreams, but I'll start at the part that I can remember the best. I dreamt that -- I think this is where it starts -- I woke up at like 3:00 in the morning to go to the bathroom, and I had a dream before, but this is the only part I can remember now. Okay, I dreamt that I was in this portable classroom. I didn't know if I was at Westport College or Modern Media College, but I was at one of them, and I was in a portable and the lights were off. And there was carpet on the floor and there were like traditional student desks. And we were going to have a presentation by Bill Putnam, who's the sound engineer, great. He's left us now, but in my dream he was still alive and he was going to come give a lecture. And for some reason I had this, it was listed in like a program that he was going to give a concert on a Hollander B3 organ, and so he came in the room, he talked to us a little, he greeted us, he was like in his 70's. He was kind of in his 70's or 80's and he kind of barely knew what he was doing. [laugh] And he was talking to us, and before I knew it, he was doing this mime of like trying to show that there was these rotten eggs and how they were smelling, and there were these teddy bears, these teddy bear heads on a stick that somebody was swirling around above the supposedly rotten eggs. And there was like a little _________ things. He was doing this whole mime, and, of course, I wasn't getting much out of it because I couldn't see what the heck he was doing. And about three desks over, to my right, kind of in the front of the room, there was this guy, kind of like a side man with a keyboard, that was supposed to play like chords and all that were going on behind the mime to kind of give it some music. And this guy was like bad, to say the least! [laugh] He was like, I don't know, it just sounded really, really bad and he didn't know what he was doing either. He was just kind of like banging around, and it didn't go with anything that was going on. And then, I don't know what happened, but the scene just sort of like suddenly switched, and we were supposed to go on a boat trip at night. I keep having dreams that Dad and us and the family are supposed to go on this boat. And so I dreamt that we were going on a boat trip, and I don't remember where we were going, but I know we were going to go at night. Oh, I remember -- this is kind of crazy, man. I don't know where this came from, but apparently, I think I kind of visualized this when we were out on our walks and this is where it came from, but I was supposed to be on the boat and sing and give a concert to some thousands of people who were along the shoreline and on docks and at the Coachman and the park and stuff. And apparently not only was I supposed to sing, but I was supposed to play too, and I had an instrument for me there on the boat, or at least I thought they were going to have one there for me. It's one of those things where you think it's going to be there, but you never see it, I guess because, I don't know, but anyway, it was supposed to be there, and it was supposed to be there, supposed to be there. And I get on this boat and it's there, and we were like getting settled and stuff and we're ready to take off, and I'm ready to stand up there and sing to the people out there, and the instrument starts shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking. And next thing I know it's the size of like something for a Barbie doll. And [laugh] the captain of the boat told me that I should take it home and put it in the bird cage for Archie [laugh], that he would want it and that he could benefit from it because he could learn some notes to sing. And like that's bizarre, man. And I think that is when I woke up. Man, man, man -- as _______ would say. I think I can start maybe unraveling where this dream may have come from. First of all, the Bill Putnam thing came from me reading the studio book, of course, but why he would come in and do a mime about rotten eggs? Don't ask me! [laugh] But it's becoming more obvious to me where the singing and playing on a boat would have come from. Astrid has been making up stories about Phil Collins sailing through the Straits of Silla and Corybdus, and playing Silla's favorite piece on the keyboard, which is, I think it is, I don't know, it's called ""Farralene"" (?), it goes [singing] and a couple others, the theme of the Titanic and different things like that. And I guess seeing the boat parade, hearing her stories about that, and being down at the waterfront and visualizing a floating stage and everybody on land watching a performance out there. All that came together and made this bizarre dream. Now the shrinking, I think might be something to the effect that it seems so close, but it's not. And, if you know what I mean, and I don't know, just something goofy that came out of that, I guess.",Negative
"The Hitler Dream. My boyfriend and I are going up hill. I am on a train or in a wheelchair. My boyfriend sees Hitler and feels he must introduce me to Hitler. I want to be with my boyfriend, but as soon as Hitler sees me, he decides he wants to have sex with me. I have no choice. I feel trapped, resigned, scared. But before he can hurt me, I must be seen by either a priest or a counselor, I'm not sure which. It saves me. It intervenes and he (Hitler) goes away.

"We had taken a car trip up to California to see Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly for a family reunion, and this is so weird -- you'd never believe it. Dad said when he was snooping around out back he found these alligators trying to get at these chickens, and a few of them were dead already, but the alligators were in the water and the chickens were up on the thing. And he got two or three of the chickens out of the way, and I can't remember, one of them had like chicken wire wrapped around its ankle, and I don't remember what all the ruckus was about, but I think it was that somebody like fell in the water and they like jumped out, but Aunt Polly saved Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Dougherty. That was weird. And we were all like packed into their bedroom, just talking and visiting and chatting and yakking and carrying on, and Dad's laying there on the bed totally exhausted, wanting to go to sleep. And here we are visiting and talking and carrying on. And so it was really, it was Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly and all of our family and we were like having a family thing. And then I dreamt that -- oh, I know -- somehow we were supposed to have taken a trip up to their house, but somehow I had the notion that our sound system was in their living room, and Uncle Charlie and Uncle Carl and Mom were watching a movie. And I was going to tell Uncle Charlie how the system is wired, but I never got around to it. But then I dreamt that Mom and I went to this park to swing on their swings, and one of them like came undone because she was trying to figure out where Ohio is. How dumb! And also we went to this library because I needed some kind of book on psychology or something, and I turned the ______ and had to go to a big philosophy library that was right next door.

"I reached underneath the piano--behind the music stand--above the strings, under the wood. People had stuffed trash there. Candy in baggies, used Kleenex, paper towels. I kept grabbing handfuls and always there was more. I was moving from 2 places. Grandmas and the log cabin. I had cleaned out from under the bed and nailed up what was in a closet--a board over it so it looked like wall. I said to Rudy, ""Don't let me forget to take down that wall."" Rudy went to take a shower and his hair was sparkly blonde like Marianna's. It was luxurious in the shampoo bubbles. My father brought a fellow over. I was wearing my overalls backwards because I put them on that way to see how it worked and then I didn't have time to change them. I was packing to move. The police were at the door. my father came and told me he brought this fella over and told him he could make a special milk shake drink. my father handed me the milk shake cup and ice cream. I had to stop cleaning. The police were knocking. My mother surprised us all by shouting from a hidden bathroom. She was taking a bath. We didn't know she was there. It was time for breakfast, she said. It was french toast. Stacks of it. Rudy put a piece (of French toast) in the sink and watched water run over it. My mother put 1-1/2 on my plate. Rudy got as many as he wanted. There were 30--40 pieces of french toast on a platter. One waffle square. And a 3rd tray of waffle-ish french toast. The man was still waiting for his ice cream. The police were still there. The ice cream man had a picture of a shadow of a wolf. He kept saying, ""You can see the wolf but you can't see his eyes."" Rudy and me looked at the picture and it could just as easy be a bunny. my father said the man needed to hook up his computer to see his e-mail. There was an electrical outlet in the closet, but I tried to explain to my father it needed a phone line too. There was a tray of plants. A man was asking me for Valium. I told him I didn't take that stuff anymore. The plants were dancing. Flowering, budding and growing leaves in comparative unison. They could see. They were facing each other.",Negative
In this dream I dreamt that I was walking along a path that was in a suburb and there was a river in the valley. I thought to myself I wish I had a fishing pole and I could go fishing. The scene shifted and I was wading along the river fishing with a flyrod. The river was very dirty and shallow where I was fishing and the bottom was very muddy and sticky. I saw how dirty the water was and decided that I would walk up the river and try to find deeper and cleaner water where I could fish. I walked along the river bank until I saw faster and clearer water. I reentered the river and began to fish again. I had no luck and was about to go further up river when I saw two fishermen coming down the river. They came up to me and I saw they were two friends of mine about 28 years old with whom I frequently go fishing. I asked them whether they had caught any fish and they answered yes. I asked them if they would give me some bait and they said it was all gone. It then began to rain and we began to run back to town. The path was very straight and lined with trees. We hardly got wet. It was lightning very hard when we got into town. A man drove past in a blue Chevrolet coupe and yelled.,Negative

It's one of the men. I wonder if I went in the wrong bathroom, but I guess the men are just rambunctious and without respect. Finally I return to the classroom. A man is in my seat. I go to him and say, ""I was here before."" He sneers. I get angry and righteous and say, ""To hell with you then."" The teacher glares at me and says, ""ou can't come back in here because you were a part of the men's mischievous disruptions of class."" I say to him, ""To hell with you. I simply left the room to go to the bathroom at the same time they all left."" He said, ""You were gone one hour. I say, ""I had a little problem, OK??"" I am belligerent, and sassy, ""and furthermore, you are boring and don't know much. If you want me to stay in the dream interpretation class, you better get good."" I go to the table where the men students are seated and it's away across the huge room. A paper comes down for me to sign, the roll call. The men all signed in funny markings to confuse the teacher.

"Baby Eagles  I'm at a house, which may be my brother Wally's. I'm looking at fishing gear in the garage. Wally shows me the big blue backpack he told me about in the garage. It is nice. It has an air-filled plastic tube as a cushion that goes around one's neck to cushion the weight of a canoe. I put the pack on and fasten the straps. Wally has some stuff in the pack. He has me step into two plastic bags and strap the bags to the pack. He says it will be easier to carry. I find difficult to walk like this: I can't take a full stride. Wally has a briefcase-like pack, which I put on. He will give it to me. There is a woman there. I pick up a pair of red rubber rain pants with rubber stocking feet. I turn the pants inside out, then inside in. I look at the fishing gear on the wall. There is no good fishing line. There is a huge spool of pink and yellow fly-fishing line. There's a lot of old fishing gear, one of my dad's big cork bobbers, and a lot of jiggle sticks. My aunt Willow Redding's friend Paul is there. I ask him if he had a good time at the Brimson Picnic.

"There was one other brief, very sketchy dream that occurred and I don't know if it was after the last dream or before, sometime during the course of the evening I dreamed of myself going down thru some sort of a tunnel or going through a subterranean door or something and entering a cave or an open cavern. I don't know why I was there. Something proceeded my going in there. Some sort of a story, but I don't know what it was. I can only remember the scene of my being in there and little holes in the floor, four set in a square as on 4 corners of a box. Candles were inserted into these holes, and I had been instructed by someone to light these candles. In the scene was I there lighting these candles. I know that this wasn't a religious celebration of any kind, but rather I was told to do this to keep the animals away. It was some such idea. There was color in this dream.

The setting was not stable in the sense that there seemed to be a movement from ___________ something that made comments and was just natural to just something altogether out of place. The trouble with the bugs was very (spawn?) real lonely. More than a fear of a number of different bugs, the dream was centered around a particular individual bug or insect, something to this effect.

"Instead of being given a life, you were given a journey across the river to the other side. The destination was always to get to the other side.

In the journey it was impossible to tell, and irrelevant to use the something or other. No hurry. No. Dora was maybe at the somewhere, not sure. Temperature water would turn into ice. Icebergs and younger something.  I was not sure what gender I belonged to. Dora was not a fancy man. She liked things simple. Watching the water turn to ice.

"I was walking around this one section of town. The town reminded me of my mother's hometown. I was trying to get some Avon orders to supplement my income since I don't have a regular job right now. I thought that perhaps I should get some books and start working the area for a while until I get another job. As I was walking, I was trying to identify the houses that I know had bought from me before. I walked across these two piles of firewood, stacked side-by-side, belonging to two different families. While I was doing that, some of the wood from a third pile rolled own a small embankment. I didn't go pick it up, convincing myself that it wasn't my fault. I walked by one house and there were many people inside. They might be having a party, so I started to walk on by. They had long rows of small cages with rabbits in them. I saw an opening where I thought I could walk between them but realized there was something overhead and I would have to get on my hands and knees to get through. About that time, the woman that lived there came out and wanted to know why I was there. I told her. She said the only Avon she buys is reorder stuff. I said, Okay. Thanks. Then I left. At this point, there are two other Avon reps walking with me. The woman who owns the woodpile walks up and talks about having to pick it all up. I didn't realize who she was or what she was talking about until she left and the other three of us walked past there again and I saw the little plastic fence messed up. I fixed the fence, put it back in place, but still didn't say it was my fault. On the other side of the fence was a long row of flowers. They looked like they were something special. They were tied up with string that was held up by poles to keep the string 8-12 inches above the ground. I was glad the wood hadn't hurt any of the flowers, but still didn't say anything. We continued walking. We came to a large rack with rows of pullout shelves. It had a few very small potted plants on them. The two women I was with turned some of them on their side so the Avon person responsible for them would know to throw them away. I realized that one of the two people with me was Laura Bl.",Positive
"Dad wanted to move his fire truck and hitch something up to it. So I crawled under it and it was like a trampoline thing, and when I went in it, it was kind of low to the ground, and I wondered how am I going to get out of here. But when I realized what they were going to do, I was scared, and I thought to myself, ""I've got to get out of here somehow."" And then I asked Dad, who was up above, I asked, ""Can I walk and down the walk while you guys do this?"" And he said, ""Sure."" So I wormed and squirmed my way out from under the truck. There was just enough room for me to squirm out from under it. And I realized that they were going to start up the engine and back it up a little bit, and then move it forward, so the result would be I would hear the back-up alarm and then hear the siren. So I figured I would walk as far away as I could and then be far way when that happened. So I took my bag -- I don't remember what I had in it at this time, but it will come to me, I'm sure. I took my bag and I went walking, and I walked, actually then I realized that the truck was parked in front of our house and I walked all the way up to 8th Street. And then I turned down 8th Street and went to 23rd Avenue and like went around a few blocks, and then I came back and they hadn't done it yet. And then I figured, ""I gotta get out of here somehow."" So I started crawling over all these boxes that suddenly appeared, and I started crawling faster and faster and faster as Dad started -- I couldn't see him, but somehow I know that he was getting in the driver's seat and getting ready to start it up. And I crawled faster and faster and faster, and all of a sudden it started becoming dark and I faded into consciousness. One other important thing about this dream that I remember is that somewhere after that I had another little dream about the digital recorder that we were using, that it was part of the truck, and that I was worried that maybe the back-up alarm or something was integrated into it because it had like the click on the side of it that went ""drive, park, reverse"" and I was deathly afraid of putting it in reverse. But I did, I asked him and he said that wasn't the case, but they did, the gas fuel alarm thing on it. That was strange. But in real life it didn't have any of that on the side. In real life it was just hunky dory, but it had bad sound.",Negative
"I was dating Eugene and he was the future creator of Facebook (it was before Facebook existed). Some people were after him because of it. We were in a building trying to get away. There was a hall with little nooks with paintings or doors at the end of them. None of the doors would open. One of the nooks had an Inglourious Basterds poster and a secret door, which opened, and we went in. There was a statute of 'Hamlet'. There was a soft wall in there with a room on the other side and I thought it was a theatre. It was darkish in the room. We tried to work out what to do. Sometimes we would time travel and try it again. Eventually he said he was going to make an announcement over the PA and he wanted me to stay here. When he was done he would travel back? He managed to make the announcement and as I listened, I was proud of him. Then it was the end of school/university. We were like 'we're not going to forget today!'. I put a book away and Elijah was standing next to me. I was then standing with Eugene and some others. His rival came over and touched my butt and I kicked him in the nuts. Nobody saw and I was annoyed. Also, at some point I was on the FilmForum group and Linus made a forum post like 'most handsome man' and I posted a list in alphabetical order. Tommy Wiseau was in there and I was confused as to why he was in the list (I thought maybe I'd put it in there as a joke, but I didn't remember).",Negative
"I am in a house setting, but it is a hospital of some kind. I am going back in and am wondering why I am. A nurse comes up to me and starts yelling. She's cold and mean, calling the patients bastards. I start yelling at her, calling her a ""son of a bitch."" She's coming at me with medication. She says, ""If you don't take the pill, I'll give you a shot."" I fight her, holding off her hand with the needle. I run, escaping. I grab slices of roast beef as I leave and eat them because I haven't eaten in awhile and will not be able to eat for awhile longer. I hop on a horse and gallop away up into the hills. We walk in the stream for awhile to cover our tracks. We find a tree. I build a hide-out of boards and moss.",Negative
"I dreamed I was walking through the middle of New York City, yet it didn't really look too much like a city. There weren't enough tall buildings and people. I came to this area with a bunch of homeless kids, and one of the boys asked me if I'd be willing to trade a dollar for a quarter. After looking into my pocket I found I had several hundred dollars with me, so I gave him my dollar. I told him he could keep the quarter but he gave it to me anyway. There was a girl, who upon seeing a bowl on top of a trailer, wondered if there was any food in it. Unfortunately, I had to answer that there wasn't any food in the bowl. Then the idea came to me that I could take her out of that ghetto area, I could show her a better life, and we could have some fun. So I asked her if she'd like to come with me, and I admitted I had some money. She said she would. For some reason one of her friends came with us too. We were walking, and I decided to ask for her telephone number. She gave me a really weird answer, although it did start with my area code; it was something like: 611-832f-9,dt. I told her I didn't know there was a comma on the telephone, and she told me she didn't either (after looking at the telephone, I found it was one of five or six symbols below the ""0"" key). She told me that was the number for her dorm, or something like that, but I didn't even think that she's homeless and probably wasn't old enough to go to college. I lost sight of her at one point and decided to call her on one of the many nearby phones. Of course, when I called the number you can expect that I'm not really calling a telephone, I'm calling HER- that is, the nearest telephone to her would probably ring. But I guess just about when I picked up the phone, she came into view and I told her I'd been looking for her. So, then we went to the amusement park, and got on a ride where you're sitting down, up to your waist in water. I don't know what the ride was supposed to do. But at that point, the girl (if, in fact, I did know her name, it was probably Julia, because that's the first name that comes to mind when I thought of her), the girl started floating in the air. It seemed a rather normal experience, and I said, ""Oh, no, how do we stop her from floating?"" I don't remember what happened after that, except that she was gone. Then, just outside the amusement park, there was a computer, a very eccentric type of computer. I was typing song lyrics into the computer. They were my own song lyrics, and I was amazed that I was typing really good lyrics without really thinking about what I was typing. I often try to write song lyrics in real life, but they never sound just right, even though I think deeply about what I'm going to write. But here, miraculously, these perfect song lyrics were being typed out by me (I'm not sure how good they would have sounded if I heard them in the physical world). There was an interesting little program on this computer that allowed me to integrate the lyrics into an actual song, just by pressing a button. The lyrics sounded excellent when put to music- in fact, I think the voice I heard singing my lyrics was none other than Steven Page, lead vocalist for Barenaked Ladies. It was my own song, yet it sounded like something Barenaked Ladies might have done- one of my real life goals (to write a song comparable to Barenaked Ladies)! Well, the next thing I remember is being in a room, and seeing the girl that just floated away on me. There were a few other people there, and I just sat down, on a couch opposite the one she was sitting on, and waved.",Negative

I rush to finish, then run down the hall to the room where I'm supposed to give birth. I'm about to begin when my best female friend/lover rushes into the room after a long day of studying and classes. (I wasn't sure she even knew about the birth. I thought she was too busy.)

"I dreamt I was over to my sister's house. She said, ""Wait til I show you the present I just got."" She ran upstairs and came down with a large cosmetic case. In it were jars of different colored face powders, like one finds at a department store for mixing personally blended Charles of the Ritz face powder. They were violet, green, rose and several shades of peach and tan. I began to fuss around with the jars when my sister came back and placed some peach powder on a little glass lid in the center of the case. At that I offered to put it in the jar with the rest of the peach powder and did so. My sister looked at me, ""What did you do that for?"" She ran out and got a fork and came back and started picking pieces of potato out of the jar. ""That wasn't powder I put there, that was potato salad,"" she told me.",Positive
"(06/08/00)[""Selling dreams.""] I am in a room where a presentation of various dream product sales people are preparing to sell their wares. They are all seated in two rows in an alcove and then in a raised bleacher thing up on the wall. Two women were standing on a raised platform near the ceiling. They were signaling to the audience with their wares. Finally, I get up on the alcove stage area to start the show. A big wall keeps appearing to my left in front of me which obscures the audiences view. I think it out of the way but it returns several times. I tell the small audience that I will begin the show. I will give each salesperson a chance to sell their wares (this surprises the women) They thought they'd have to sneak attention. Then I point out a wall of small dream products and say contrary to what it looks like, we aren't just here to sell dream products. We have a good show for you. Later, I am seated in the audience, waiting. A bathroom is down a step in a hall. I will it to be accessible on the same floor level. It changes.",Negative
Gary Redding's Tie  I'm talking with my uncle Gary Redding. We close the door on a semi truck. There is a ladder that has rungs that are split in half and won't stay connected because a piece is missing. Gary and I walk back home from the area around the Chinese Buffet in Oak Valley. He has a pornographic magazine. We walk past where the old Corner Cafe was. He talks about shipping neckties at least two days in advance of a big event. I get down to where my neighbor Donald Branson used to live. My uncle Rusty Redding is there. As I walked to his spot a little girl passed me up walking. My cousin Melvin Redding is there. Rusty is outside the house building a clothesline.,Positive

I am with the man who has visions from the television show Millennium, and two women. We are in a car. The four bad guys come and get one of the women, who is young. They have already taken this woman once. They pull her out of the back drivers-side seat of the car. The Millennium man gets out of the car. He has a sledgehammer and a log. Norman has a log, and he throws it at our car. The Millennium man beats up the four bad guys: he kicks their asses!",Positive
"Now I remember the image of the dream. I am with a very tender, sweet, affectionate cat and I feel that I really love him. It seems that he feels the same way because he rubs his body against my leg; I am standing. Then I go into a house and see some very fine porcelain figures on some shelves on the wall (at least I think so), and I have the impression that I must wash them. Then I go up (I suppose, because in my dream I am suddenly upstairs) and talk about something to my friend T. (she is about 40, married twice and twice a widow; I love her dearly. She has 5 children and one of them is already married. She is very understanding with me.) I don't remember the conversation.",Negative
"I have a questionnaire and I need three women and three men to answer it for me. I am on a bus and the door is open. A swarming crowd of revelers are all around. I watch as a man with a blue face lies on the sidewalk and tells the woman he's with that he loves her. I chuckle because it is obvious they are strangers and the man is horny. I try to ask several men to fill out the questionnaire. They are too rushed and busy. One hesitates and I kindly assure him he can go on, I can find someone else. Now the bus accidentally got caught in the Rose Parade. The marchers are a bit annoyed at us and we try to drive out of the way and park in a parking lot. We see a man who is very angry at a policeman for reprimanding him and he is angrily smashing the policeman's car to bits. Now I am in a huge house, perhaps a mansion. I am worried about Charla. A woman has lured her away and has taken her into one of the rooms and is molesting her. I see an image of Charla with her vagina exposed. I race from room to room opening doors and looking.

I was near the kitchen and Dad reminded me to make breakfast. Then Ezra was there. We got to school which was really different and I told Ezra to go upstairs (so I could tell him I was walking). We were in this big room. Ezra said ""Hey Aunt Sally' and I saw her sitting in there. I didn't know any of the teachers there. It was for form so I was trying to find mine. There was a guy and a girl and I asked each of them if they were from B2 but neither answered. A movie about some wagging boy had come out recently. There was something about A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm McDowell was hitting some guy in the balls. This lady teacher was annoying me so I yelled at her and started walking out. Ms Pascal was coming and everyone ran out of the room, so I went with them to sneak out. There was a pink bike near some trees. I took it, but had trouble with it. I got home.

"I was in this group of people. I think we were either singers or performers or something.

I guess the ____ stories are going to my head. And so we decided we were going to take this little jaunt, trip so maybe we would finally understand how it went. And Mom was kind of volunteering with that and she came back to get me because everybody kind of left me behind. And everybody was going on their way and Mom was driving me in this van that is like the yellow cab van, except it wasn't yellow, it was brown. And it had like a two-way radio in it and I could hear Sparky talking. He's the cab dispatcher. And, oh, Mom was showing me that she bought these pins of like different figures for people to wear, and I was like dressed in this costume. And I don't remember ever getting there.

"I was someplace where there were a lot of other people. It had been raining and the area was flooded. I needed to get from one building to the other and the only way I could get there was by boat. There was no motor so I had to use oars. I didn't have trouble getting to the new location but found it much more difficult to get back. It started raining and storming again and the flooding water became very active and extremely dangerous. People were panicking and scrambling to figure out a way to save themselves from drowning. A lot of people were unsuccessful and died. Some family members present. In a two-story house. Someone brought me a crying baby. It wasn't an infant, but old enough to hold its head up and to almost sit up itself. It was a relative. I think it was a boy. The baby was in a seated position on my right arm. I gently pushed his head down against my shoulder while I began a rocking motion and stroked his head to calm him and help him go back to sleep. Someone offered to take him from me and I told him that it was fine. I said he was scared and just needed to be comforted until he fell back to sleep. I took him back into the house and up to the second floor. The storm had been causing a lot of internal damage. I was trying to clean up some of the damage even though the storm was still going on and still causing lots of damage. Matthew, as an adult, was there. I placed a drawer back in a dresser. As I did so Matthew walked out of the room and I broke down, saying that Matthew, referring to him as a baby, had died. I dropped face down onto the bed and was sobbing. Darren was standing at the doorway saying something to try to comfort me but he was making it sound like it was no big deal. This made me very angry. I continued to sob. The dream starts over from the beginning. This time I and a few other people know what's coming so we start doing things to try to keep people from dying this time. One of the locations where I was had something like a bomb shelter. They opened the door and were trying to encourage people to go in because they knew they would be safe there. Several people had small boxes of herbal tea bags with strings and the little square of paper attached as though they had been individually wrapped. They hadn't been though. They were telling people to reach into the box and take one per person as they would help keep them safe. I knew I didn't have one the first time around so I made sure to get one this time. I didn't feel the same fear this time. I was still feeling, emotionally and physically, the seriousness of the situation. I don't think I felt the same fear or anxiety. Maybe because I knew what was coming and we had a chance to prepare.",Negative
"Merrilee was joining the United Nations ________ Center, and I think Merrilee turned into Cassandra later in this dream, but one of the ladies convinced Mom that I should join too, and they were going to this major convention at this hotel.

Everybody spoke English, but there were a lot of ethnic accents. And they were going to have this big banquet and the end goal of the whole dream was to get to the big banquet and meet up with Mom and Cassandra. So I went to the registration desk and I showed them my ID, and they said, ""Who did you come with?"" and I said, ""Maggie Henderson."" And they looked in their data base and they said, ""Oh yes, we have you."" And they gave me four choices of ______ to pay _____: fifty, twenty-five, fifteen or ten. So, of course, I paid the $10 because I didn't know what it was for. And then I went down this little hall, thinking I might find the banquet hall. And there was this room. By this time I met up with this lady who was helping kind of guide me along, and she was big and fat and a little rough, but she was kind and she sort of grabbed me by the arm and we were like walking around. She told me there was this private party going on in that room and I could hear an Irish jig going on. And then we went up a little couple of stairs and through a back hallway and go to this banquet hall that looked more like a restaurant. It had square wooden tables and we were sitting in wooden chairs. And there were no table cloths or anything on these tables, and Mom and Cassandra were sitting at a regular table, and they put Courtney and me at a little kids' table across the way. And it turns out that Mom and Cassandra and Courtney and everybody were getting fish fillets and vegetables, and all I got was a little piece of bread and half a cup of Shirley Temple in a Styrofoam cup.

There was a section of the place (it was school like) that was messy and there had obviously been a big fight there. There was a giant arrow and I said ""ooh, can I have this?"" and someone said ""They'll get you before you pick it up and turn it around to them"". We were then given darts to get them with. More came and I had extremely good accuracy, getting them directly in the heart. I missed a few though and kept stabbing them until they were gone. Some ran towards us at one point and I had an arrow and a dart and held them out and killed them.

"I think everyone that was working on the house was getting really tired. Some of the construction workers started drinking and some of them got very much out of control. Some of them were coming on to me, but some simply because they were drunk and one or two were earnest in their affection. A lot of them were getting very boisterous and acting very rowdy and inappropriate, taking their clothes off and such. I decided to try to get away from the mess. I headed to my car but was afraid to go all the way to my car because of some of the men around it and because some of the drunken workers were driving their cars around there like maniacs and I didn't want to get hit. I also had Rachel S with me. Someone offered to walk me to my car but then they almost got hit. Another woman arrived and offered to let me use her car. We had to do something with child car seats. A very heavy rain came and was causing a small flood. Some of the cars were halfway deep in water. I was trying to get away. Someone gave me a parachute and walked with me, there was a group of us, to this bridge. We had to jump off the bridge and then open our parachutes. We couldn't see anything but clouds below us so we had no idea what we were jumping into. Some of them were scared because I opened my parachute too soon. I think I was holding Rachel S while I did this. I landed just fine. Then we had to jump into these boats on this river. I did that with no problem. There were lots of dishes, and decorative items floating in the water. I saw people gathering things. I gathered a few items. Just as I was getting ready to get out of the boat I learned that we were allowed to keep anything we gathered. I was disappointed that I had not gathered more. I didn't seem to have Rachel S any longer. I asked how to let the boat know when I needed to get off to get to my car. Now my car was in a different lot and it was daylight. Someone told me to pull on something and then would slow and pull to shore. I got off and walked about two blocks to my car. I was back to where I had to jump in the boat in the river. This time I knew about gathering things so I was able to gather up quite a few things. One woman gave me her car keys and instructed me to go get her car and pull it up to where the boat would pull to shore so we could easily load up all the things we gathered. Anyway, she got in trouble for parking her car somewhere that it wasn't supposed to be. They let me off the hook when they realized I didn't know anything about it, that I was just trying to do her a favor by coming to get her car.",Negative

I saw approval as a winner in one of the races. It seemed he paid about $20. I had a hammer and a nail. I was driving the nail thru a rag on the bench and I was looking at the entries. There were a lot of nails on the bench. I have a vague thought that I saw a Mac horse run 2nd and it seems I saw a reward horse that won. There seemed to be entries on a race. Then under the entries these horses were marked larger in print and were winners.,Negative

"I dreamed that my brother-in-law & I were walking down town in C____. We met this friend who turned to me and said that his daughter wanted to see me. I looked down E____ Ave. & she was in their car waiting for me and at the same time, she was holding up traffic. Drivers behind her were getting impatient & were blowing their horns. As I crossed the street to get into the car, I was conscious of wearing my bedroom slippers as I realized they looked a little conspicuous in downtown C____.  A___ & I drove away and she told me that she was extremely nervous as she had just been in a wreck. She was extremely anxious about her sister-in-law who had just had a baby and who was with her at the time of the wreck.  By this time we were driving down a rather narrow road - just wide enough for 2 cars. It was at night & the street was dark. I offered to drive for her, so she stopped the car & we exchanged places. There wasn't much traffic so I was going pretty fast. Ahead, I could see a car parked & a big greyhound bus coming. I thought I could pass the parked car before I met the bus but I couldn't. We collided & we all got out to see the damages. I told A___ that I had no driver's license but not to mention the fact. The bus driver was rather belligerent at first but it wasn't long before he was trying to help us. He lifted the bus, which was resting on our fender & separated the two.

"I was in Russia on some sort of government mission along with a number of other people. I don't recall how many. We were talking to Khrushchev and other Russian officials about world peace. Khrushchev spoke excellent English. We went back to the United States and made some reports and Khrushchev was due to come over for a conference with President Kennedy. I was telling Kennedy how Khrushchev spoke excellent English, and he was sort of disappointed because he spoke excellent Russian and he wanted a chance to speak it at the conference. I also told him that Khrushchev seemed to want peace, and yet he really wasn't doing anything to get peace, but rather engaging in military buildups and the like. Khrushchev and his party arrived and the meeting seemed to be held in a tavern or something like that. There were booths along the wall and tables and Khrushchev was sitting up at one end of the room and I was sitting down at the far end talking with Kennedy. Kennedy asked Khrushchev something about why he had pounded his shoe at the U.N. and Khrushchev obligingly took off his shoe and pounded it on the table and made some sort of reply which I don't recall. Kennedy then put on some sort of a robe. I guess that's the best description of it. It looked like it was made out of a thousand mops. It included some kind of headdress. It looked like some wild sort of Russian dressed in fur, but the fur looked more like mops and he went over to Khrushchev and put down five glasses on the floor, arranged in a square with one in the center. He had Khrushchev stand up on the last two glasses and told him to step over onto the other two, and Khrushchev stepped on the center glass, then on the other two. Then Kennedy stepped on two of the glasses, then right onto the other two without using the center one. He told Khrushchev that was the trouble with him; he wasn't very brave or something because he stepped on the center glass. By this time Khrushchev also seemed to have one of those mop-like robes on, in numerous colors incidentally, and then they started dancing around each other, then they grabbed each other and started wrestling. Finally I believe Kennedy got Khrushchev down and I and some of the other unknown people were thinking that this might be a good way to settle world peace. Let the two most important people fight it out here and now. Then Khrushchev was hurt and he was going to be flown back to Russia to get some medical attention. At this point in the dream there were some sudden shifts. It seems that now some sort of Russian pilot was hurt and had to be taken back to Russia, and I and some other people were driving him back in a car. Other people have already been driven back to Russia in other cars and I was sitting in the back while we were driving back to Russia, except now the setting was in my hometown and we were driving toward the countryside. Once again the dream suddenly changed so that now I was riding a bicycle along some back country roads. I'm not sure now, but I seem to be 14 or 15, something like that, and the place I was going to was a Boy Scout camp I went to as a youngster, and I was riding along on my bicycle and also trying to hitchhike cause I was holding out my thumb to cars passing by cause I knew that I had about 75 miles to go and it would take me a long time to ride there on my bicycle. I went thru some crossroads in a small town and the road seemed quite familiar here. As I went on beyond this, the road I was on turned into a dirt track. I knew I was lost because I had gotten off the road, so I turned back around and came on to some people on the road and asked them, I believe, where Route 54 went, and the people told me to just pedal along and I would see it on my right. So I got on it and kept going along it and I came to a place where the road split into the regular route and the scenic route and I took the scenic route. This was all very similar to places I have been to before actually. Now I came to a spot where a ferry went across the river and somehow I had driven my bicycle right up onto the ferry, and I have been on this ferry in a dream before, but I am certain there is nothing correspondent in reality anywhere. First I wanted to get off the ferry because I didn't have any fare, but it was too late as it was already starting out. The ferry got halfway across and stopped in midstream while the stewardess, a woman just like the airline stewardess, collected the fare from the passengers. When she came to me, I had taken my wallet out and I told her I didn't have a car and she said there wouldn't be any fare for me. I put my wallet back and I didn't seem to have much money anyway, except maybe for a couple of dollars. The ferry went on across the river and docked on the other side. I rode my bicycle down the ramp and started riding up out of the place and found I really wasn't on the road, but I was on a dirt track. Right directly to my left there was a woman pushing a baby stroller up another dirt road and that was really the right road out of the place as it turned out, but it was a very steep road and I wondered how many cars could get up it. It was extremely steep. I went on up and was pulling on my bicycle to bring it on up with me. There was a little boy ahead of me who started slipping some and fell back into me and I caught him and then he climbed on up. Then the last stretch of the road I was climbing up there was a mattress that was placed at a very high angle and I reached up and grabbed the top of it and pulled myself over. The bicycle seemed to have disappeared by now and as I pulled the mattress back, there was a machete in a sheath underneath the mattress, and I remember that I had hid that machete there the last time I had been there, a year or two ago. And it had my name on it, except my name was Leonard something or other. So I picked up my machete and I also had a sheath knife with me now, and climbed over a sill which was right in front of me now and into the office of this place and went over to the drinking fountain to get a drink of water. Somebody spread the rumor that the machete I was carrying belonged to somebody whose name started with an R and had been stolen. So somebody saw me with the machete and thought I had stolen it, but I told them that was ridiculous because my name was obviously on here. It wasn't the name of the person from whom the machete had been stolen. This is about all I recall. Quite a number of elements in this dream are related to things we did and talked about last night, including the route number 54. We were on a Route 55 last night. The costume of Khrushchev and Kennedy, the mop-like thing, we talked about someone who was dressed in a robe and turban-like affair and several other minor things like this.",Negative

"I was at a deli in the lollies section and they were expensive. Mom said to just get individual packets because it was cheaper. They had the pineapple lollies.

"Soft piano music with a string orchestra in the background. Autumn leaves fall around the road in a crisp wind. The sun is angling through the trees, casting a gold glow over everything. The massive RV has a large empty space in the middle, and everybody is laying around under blankets inside. The RV is slowing to a halt. It's clear our journey is coming to an end. It is my job to distribute the magazines. I give one to Laura and set one aside for myself. There are two other people I don't know in the RV, and I give them their magazines. I approach Kermit the Frog, who takes a copy of People, and thanks me profusely. I go up to the driver's cockpit as Dr. Teeth (who has been driving) brings the RV to the side of the road. I show him what we have left: Country Living and the Jarvis Catalogue. ""Oh yeah man, thanks, just what I need, alright, absotively, possolutely!"" He takes them and I retire to my blankets in the back of the RV with my magazine, as the piano music slows and quiets down. I drift slowly out of the dream, feeling very warm and content, thinking: Ah, what a nice dream. It takes me at least ten minutes to begin laughing.",Positive
"In this dream my partner and I have a brand new baby. Except it's not like a normal baby - it's like a very small person with quite long legs. Like a foal, it manages to stand up and even walk within hours. We dress it in trousers and a little top. There's another couple who have a little child - a little girl (we have a boy). Their child too can walk within hours. For some reason I'm in charge of them both, and they are both in boxes on a shelf. In the excitement I forget about them - i suddenly remember and realize they might be dehydrated or need feeding. Later my partner and the other couple return. My partner is scathing about the other couple - about how they are failing to look after their little girl properly, letting her walk off in a shopping centre with very wobbly legs. Both the 'babies' start to talk within hours - they start questioning us, putting together clumsy sentences.",Negative
"I went to school and people were talking about a new Beatles song. I don't know what it was. They also kept saying 'Paperback Letter' instead of writer. Then I was in the library and Svetlana, Yelena and I were doing weird colouring-ins and playing Uno. Some people were also wearing Green Day shirts. I sat at a table in S+E, and then that gay Classmate-M-30 guy also sat at the table and a camera kept moving. There was a strange map. I had a shower at school and Mom was supposed to be taking me to get an x-ray but she sent me to school for a bit and I walked out of the school.",Positive
"I realize that there is more to our new house in this new state than I had previously explored.  There is an upstairs, for one thing.  Apparently someone else is living there, because when I go up, there is a children's room at the top of the stairs, and children's things are all about.  There are a lot more rooms, and some of them have large windows in them; there are people seated on furniture on the other side of them.  At first I think there is another house adjoining ours, and the windows are between them, but then I realize that they are simply between rooms in the same house.  There is also a third level, beneath the main level.  There is a bathroom which has a bathtub which is narrow and deep enough for one person to stand up waist deep in water; there is also a hot tub in that room.  Down the hall there is a swimming pool.  At first it appears that the ceiling is too low for people to raise their heads above the water, but then someone turns on the lights and I see that the illusion was created by a single low pipe at head level near the door to the pool.  The house is fabulous, and even though it is much larger than my wife Anita and I need, I tell her that at $290K it is a bargain, and we should stretch our budget to buy it.  Now she is the reluctant one; she doesn't want all the additional space.  I want to discuss it with her, but she is talking to a friend in the living room, and there is a black choir practicing outside and we have two open windows with no glass in them, so it is too noisy to talk.  I put two cushions in one of the windows, but they don't completely fill it, and I have nothing with which to fill the other one.   I leave the house and walk to a nearby hotel/shopping complex, much like the Mall in our former city.  As I am starting up the escalator, I hear someone talking about my alma mater.  When I look down, I see a man of about 70 in a university t-shirt (my alma mater).  I quickly step off the escalator, and when I do, I hear him tell someone else, ""Maybe we can find Phil.""  I am surprised, because I don't recognize him.  I go and introduce myself.  He shows neither surprise nor recognition.  There are two or three other university people there, and I am afraid they are soliciting contributions to the Annual Fund drive, but they never ask me for money.  One of them asks me if I live in a certain place, and I tell them no, I haven't lived there for many years; I live within walking distance of the hotel.  He says he does too.",Negative
"(10/21/97)[""Freedom.""] The same dream continues later. As I am in the glass container a sheriff comes by and announces that we are free. We are so numbed by our dreadful experiences we can hardly comprehend. I am a young woman, fully able bodied, and I dazedly try to follow the man and woman I had been with. The sheriff is taking them to a federal building. I suspect a trap and we will be killed. But I doggedly follow them. I lose track of them and go to the Sheriff's office. Many regular people are there, they are all seated on the floor, in semi-prone positions. I go to the Sheriff and ask where my friends are. All the people pull back from me, shunning me. The sheriff tells them that I am no longer just a creature, but a real person. They must learn to accept me. I feel alone and scared and disbelieving this will change and I will really be free.",Negative
"(03/17/01)[""Gardens in the hall.""] I am walking down a long hall in an apartment building. The hall area in front of every apartment door is decorated like an indoor garden, each one uniquely different. I see the pretty waterfalls and hanging plants. And statuary. They are very lovely. The apartment I am being shown is at the very end of the hall. I go in and it looks very nice, a red brocade couch. I need to go talk to the landlord and make arrangements. The man showing me the apartment gives me a special outfit I must wear for this interview. It is a formal pink gown with a ruffly stole that goes around my face and shoulders, up to my eyes. We go up to the top floor and I go to the door. I see odd letters that I think are dutch words but they look more Arabic or Chinese. This is the list of roommates that live in this apartment. I timidly knock on the wall near the door. Then I knock louder on the door. I wait.",Negative
"The Orange Suit  I arrive at Washington University with my sister Ramona. We're both taking a (different) class there. She pulls the car up the curb on the left side of the road. I'm wearing orange pants and a tight orange shirt. We get out of the car. She follows me as I look at the name of the building to see if it's where I need to go. The name of the building is ____ ( I forget). I see my classmate Bryan Beard, and he says we're in the same class. He is wearing a white shirt and black tie. We walk down into the building, which is not unlike McNeely Hall at the University of Springfield. I sit down in a chair in the classroom #100. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor comes in with roses. He is in a hurry to leave. I ask the people there if this is an Introduction to Psychology class. I slur my speech because my retainer is in, and I sound stupid. The woman professor says they call the class by a different name, maybe Cognitive Psychology. There are about 10 people in the class; almost all are women. I have a hair binder and an old beat up prickly black comb wrapped around my right pinky finger. One of the women behind me talks to me about this, and other things. I don't encourage her conversation, but reply briefly.",Negative
"I was watching Doctor Who. The Doctor (David Tennant) landed right in front of some cops. Some girl's sister died and her other sister went loopy. The older one befriended The Doctor somehow. The cops were trying to map out the TARDIS, but they couldn't get in. Obviously, it was big. The Doctor and the girl were in a backyard and there were smokes on the windowsill, so The Doctor was having a smoke, and I was thinking he was hot.

When I left a while later, Darren asked if I'd seen the squirrel and I said ""I thought it was a squirrel"" but that I thought I'd imagined it. They said they needed to get it. It was just a mouse looking thing. It bit my hand, which stung and Mom put some cream on it. Mom also asked me at one point if I'd worn a pad at all during my last period because ""there was blood on everything"". I was walking to the car and I passed Eugene and I put my hand out and our fingers touched. We were then both sitting in the back of a car and I can't remember where the drivers were going. Then I was with Mom and Ezra. Leslie lived next door to this person Mom went to see. She was holding her baby and it had a dirty face. I spat on my hand and was cleaning its face, while I was holding it. I handed it back, noticing that it was pretty heavy and almost fell back. We drove back in there at a later time, and there were shoes making up the line in the middle of the road. I was then reading a book or watching a movie and in it, this guy went into this warehouse like building (it was shed-like, but big). It had a roller door. He was looking for this guy. The guy was in there and he followed him through this tunnel underground. Then it was a game and I had to pick four out of quite a few options about what I wanted him to do (and in turn, what I thought would make the most interesting reading experience). The guy's thoughts were in the book and he was thinking that it had now been 18 months under there. The bad guy decided to get it over with and confronted him -- he was a demon looking thing [Clive Barker style].",Negative
"A friend of mine (m, 23) took me into a building in search of something (I don't know what). He opened a door and there was a winding corridor cluttered with dusty antiques. We followed the passageway until we came to an open room. Several men popped up from behind objects with rifles, and we were stopped. Then two girls (probably about 25) came in with the leader (m) of the gang who was fat and about 35-40. My friend was taken away and I was led into a waiting room where I sat with the two girls and a man. Eventually another girl came out of the room adjoining the waiting room and said it was my turn to go into the leader's bedroom. The scene changed to the hallway where we had originally entered.

"I was walking in what may best be described as an empty subway tunnel although I am not familiar with such things. There were no tracks but evidence that people had been there was seen by the fact that the circular walls (of rock) had scribbling etched on them somewhat as the interior of a phone booth. The farther end was a great ways off, but I could see light in the distance. Also I could hear music. As I continued walking the sound of cascading water drowned out the music. I found that the tunnel opened into a marshland which was strewn with large rocks or boulders. I climbed upon one of the boulders, whereupon I noticed that there were several lead soldiers strewn over it. I tried to line them up in military fashion but the constant slapping of the water over the edge of the rock knocked them over. I put them in my pocket (shirt) and started for a house (which appeared unaccountably) but I seemed top heavy and stumbled and fell into the water.

There was no kitchen, because someone else did her cooking. I saw a pretty Afghan, multi-colored, and a rocking chair, a single bed, with lots of lovely windows.

"Apparently this dream concerned hoods or gangsters. They were very typical, untouchable type, television gangsters. They were very ordinary, not very clever men at all. Two of them seemed to be the principal characters. One was large and fat, the other one looked like me. It was me. The setting seemed to have been an open field, surrounded by woods, and the action began with some sort of treachery underfoot, whereupon some commodity or sort of goods that were in the fields were being stolen by a faction of our gang. Apparently the fat man was the head, top dog, and I was apparently the second dog, and our gang was split into factions where some followed this fat man, and some followed me. The impression I got was that we were in competition with one another, that is to say, he and I and the two gangs--one gang really but two factions of the same gang. Somehow--the action is not too clear here, but the scene shifts, so that now the fat man is in the field and we are talking , and the goods are gone, and apparently his faction has got them. I think it's narcotics. Anyway, we're talking and he has engineered the whole plot and I'm very distraught about the whole thing. And he's being very understanding, and we're trying to figure out together who's behind the theft. We can't figure it out. The story shifts to where now I'm talking to him over the telephone at an airport. I'm about to leave for Italy. Very appropriate. I'm telling him--I can see us both talking on the phone at the same time--like he on one end and a stretch of distance in the middle and I on the other end. He's telling me that he's going to do something, some dire deed that I don't want him to do, and I'm pleading with him not to do it, that I'll get the goods back somehow and I'm promising that I'm going to have these goods back--all the while he's just smiling. Of course, I can't see this--he sounds on the phone like he's dead serious, but I can see it in the dream that he's smiling while he's talking to this other gangster, which is me, because he's pulled a slicky and apparently by one means or another he had a plan figured out whereby he's going to collect for the stolen goods twice and I'm not in on it. Anyway just to appease me, he says, ""Okay, he'll give me another chance to retrieve these goods while I'm in Italy,"" knowing all the while that I couldn't and then we didn't hang up or anything and the scene shifted again to where I'm now in some dark, dingy crumby little place. It would be logical to say this was in Italy, but there was nothing around to distinguish it from any place else. I was just someplace, either squatting on a chair or squatting on the floor in the process of cutting a large barrel of heroin, I guess. Anyway, I was cutting it with something, I was mixing it, and I was funneling it into little capsules like you see in the movies, putting this stuff together for marketing.",Negative

I was lining up for the bus and Jake was there. Calvin got on the bus before me and someone got on through the other side. I got on when the teacher wasn't looking and the bus started. People were pushing me back. I went next to Calvin and got the window seat. The bus took off and left the others behind. I was annoyed because Dmitri was on the other bus. Daryl was in the crowd.,Negative

"I dreamed that was in typing class and the world's greatest typist (don't remember her name) was there and the kids in our typing class were trying to beat this famous typist. We all had three times to try and see if we could type faster than she could because there was a prize of $11,000 to the one who could beat her. No one could, but then on my last try I finally beat her by 1 stroke. Just as they were handing me the money, I woke up. What a disappointment because I never did get the money.",Negative

"I was on a beach and I was thinking about getting in the water, when there was a tidal wave. It started getting higher and higher and Ezra and I climbed up this big step thing. Waves kept coming higher each time, and we climbed up higher. Eventually it went right over us at the top step. I climbed down and ran to these steps attached to a building which were surrounded by glass. I realized I was trapped there, so I got down and tried to find a car. I found a golf buggy, but it was really slow. A girl was following me. I got off and there was a tent on some grass. There were two weird looking babies in there with big heads. An insane lady grabbed one and bit out its throat and started eating it. Blood went everywhere and I ran. The waves were finally over and I started looking for everyone I had been there with.",Negative

There was a library in there. I wanted to get a book out but you had to fill out an application. I was yelling at Dad for buying it. Ezra was walking down the street, and we were in a car.

He took a guitar off them and I was calling for him not to get in the car with them, but I don't think he could hear me.",Negative
"I am at a gas station and a bad guy, ""Charlie Brown"", is coming to do mischief. I get up on the roof of the gas station in order to defend. When Charlie Brown arrives, I have the element of surprise. I jump down and somehow get him to a position where he is lying on the ground helpless. I have a rifle with me and I fire it in his general direction, apparently not actually harming him. He is shocked that I would shoot at a defenseless man and he tells me, ""I wouldn't shoot if you were lying here.""",Negative
"I am a member of a two- person team and the other team is getting ready to descend the cliff. We sneak under them at the base of the cliff to spy. They are wimps and are going to drive down and around in a car rather than repel down the cliff face, like we did. I keep very close to the rock face so they won't see us. I keep shifting my position around to remain undetected. Now I am creeping down a long dirt rut behind a shield of grasses. A goat comes up to me and is grazing. I get around the goat and see the hut of a native African friend of mine and ask his wife if I may come in to observe the other team through their window. She agrees. It is a skinny little room and only one chair in it and I use it to sit in front of a round, pretty window. The window has a slit in it and there is a wooden shield closed over it. I ask the woman to open the shield so I may see. She goes outside and does so. I see two men seated near the window talking, an English captain and someone else. I listen in on their conversation, hoping they don't see me.",Negative

I went inside a small room.  UB40's ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" was playing.  Jeremy was sitting among many people and I was in complete love of the event.  I hugged Jeremy from behind and he swayed to the music.  I sang a little though it was a hard song for me to model.  Other people were around.  My housemate Drake was in bed in front of us.",Positive

"A girl in a pair of pants and bra only was standing on the stairs. I identified the girl as one in my dorm. Her legs were very tan and long and more thin than any I have ever seen. It seems my boyfriend was looking in and admiring her and stroked her leg once. I was somewhat jealous, but I tried not to appear so. I don't remember for sure, but it seems that I dismissed Helen, whose legs are not like that, by saying, ""That's all,"" as though she were a model or something. There was no rancor in my tone, only command.",Positive
"I'm Already Dead  I'm in a muddy swamp area. I am wearing new looking white and red Nike high top sneakers. There is a basketball hoop there, which is kind of small. I jump up and rise, slam dunk the ball and break the rim. I feel powerful. I notice the hoop was shorter than it should be. There is a gang there dressed in black. I walk around a car. Two men pull out their handguns and try to fire at me, but they are out of bullets. I go back around the car and the trunk is open. I pull out a machine gun and kill everyone, mowing them down. I shoot a lot of gang members. I get shot from behind, and I say to the person who shot me that I'm already dead! I feel nothing. I'm in a building with others. I'm in a room with two people.

"I made up a little song about sine and cosine, like in math, and I was working equations and singing the song. Out front there was a crowd and video cameras were watching everything and a little baby boy with blond hair just died instantly. His mother came shrieking out of nowhere and snatched up the baby and fought through the crowds like it was nothing. In the crowded store Delores was stealing batteries--one legged Delores and telling me to hush up when I kept on staring at the batteries she was putting away. We were building a loft. It was me and Rudy's space. I could see Alex through the glass. Cups were outside. People in the front were handcuffing guys to the side they were handcuffing 2 more guys. I had been eating a very small apple pie (tart). I told the police I lived there. I had to mop the water that had come through the floor. In front of the gas station I was laying in a lounge chair. Lisa was in the other chair. We were laying out topless. We were both getting sunburned. A snowball fight was going on. They were throwing snowballs at each other, packing the ice real hard like rocks before we threw. She was not a very good aim.

"We were in a classroom and Ms Nowak was teaching, but most of the class was different. Our assignment was to write stories based on these vague one-sentence plot lines. The first one was something like 'your best friend wakes you up as a baby at 5am' and she said she always imagined waking up in Africa. I asked if 'best friend' could be yourself or anything since I didn't have a best friend or any close friends and she said I could. I decided to write it from the point of view of the Star Child from 2001: A Space Odyssey where his best friend is the Earth and he's waking up to watch over it. Ms Nowak said there were 39 answers to all the questions and I was like 'what there can't possibly only be 39 different stories' and I was pretty sure no-one would've done mine.",Positive
"Ann and I were in a caf. She got up and was in the washroom. When she came back, she sat near a drunk and he was putting his arms around her waist. But I said, ""Hey, none of that stuff,"" and Ann came over by me. I bawled her out for sitting there. She said she thought she was beside me. We walked along a river bank. I got on the other side and walked. I saw Ann on the other side. She had on a blue dress and looked beautiful. I looked for a place to cross where it was shallow. I was right across from Ann. She went into the water and went under. I stood ready to go after her if she didn't come up, but she came up and had on that blue dress. I finally crossed and we walked together. Then we were going for the ocean. We came to a creek that was dry. We walked on the bottom. There was a boat on dry land and then it got muddy. We walked a little way and there was another boat and water enough to float on. I did a little repair on the boat and we were going to go to town on the boat. Audrey, Bob and Barb's son were with us. He was always under the water, he liked it so. We were in a place where there was an alligator. The little boy was with us and the alligator was after the boy. I held him. Ann gave the alligator something to eat. As he did so, I said, ""Put the glass between his jaws,"" and I pulled away the boy. Then she put the glass between his jaws again and we got away. He had his jaws open and we had to do this to keep him from swallowing the boy.",Negative

"I was in the country. I saw two bulls and a small puny cow. One bull tried to mount the cow, but she always moved when he tried. I was watching them. Then the other bull tried to do the same, but didn't succeed. I was digging Frank Kogler's yard up. I dug into a treasure. It was a 2 lb. can full of pennies. I took a few of them and looked over a few of them to see if there were any Indian heads, but I didn't see any. I had the ground kind of piled up as I dug. I saw Kogler out of his house. I motioned to him I dug up his pennies. He made off as though he didnÕt' know of it, but then remembered. I was looking for a part-time job. There were coke ovens and I asked the man if I could draw one each day, but he made alibis that it was taken. I was on St. Clair Ave. Carl Fisher won a bowling trophy.

"I'm outdoors, in an area with a lot of trees and open space, away from downtown, though you can see it over the tops of the trees. [Something is happening that involves mention of a hospital.] I'm going to walk up to the street [and do something, maybe I'm going for a car or a cab or an airplane]. As I walk over a slight rise, I can see more of downtown and the power lines that crisscross the air. On one of them are two figures, much larger than life but somewhat smaller than parade balloons - one's Batman (black suit and cape, like the movie), and the other one's female, and they're lying on the wire, embracing as if they're making love, but with all their clothes on. She's got long dark hair and dark clothing. I don't know precisely who she is, but I accept this as quite normal. It's apparently some sort of promotional stunt for the next Batman movie. What it appears to be is two real people inside some sort of giant costumes, and they operate inside them as if it was themselves. As I walk, watching from time to time, they get more vigorous. Out of the corner of my eye it looks quite real. Finally their humping gets real exaggerated, and they raise up in the air high enough to turn over backwards and fall off. As you might expect, Batman ""flies"" down, doesn't drop like a stone, and goes out of sight behind something. I'm still walking on, and now I see the two of them standing on a rise, their arms out, facing more or less my direction, their mouths open. They're singing, but I'm too far away to hear. More of the promotion. Up in the sky, there are little private planes from time to time - actually quite a lot of traffic - and now some of them are towing banners that say, ""Batman"". I pass by them and come to Lloyd's house. Lloyd lives right on a main street in a sort of industrial district; next to maybe an auto salvage yard, across from an empty lot, like that. It's part of a group of houses, though, an interconnected project a bit like condos, maybe, and the road by them goes from the street back, past his house, into the complex. I go through his house and speak briefly to him and a woman friend who's with him. [Whatever was going on where I started out, they are part of, or at least they know all about it.] They ask if there's anything for them to do, and I say no, I'm just going on out to get [the car?]. About now, I notice what I'm wearing. It's a sort of baby-doll top and underpants, seems to be blue or black, something dark, but quite short, nearly doesn't reach my thighs, and suddenly I'm very self-conscious. I could do something about it, I guess, ask Lloyd or the other woman if I could change, or something, but I don't want to appear unsure of myself, or scared. So I go on out, wondering if they're thinking I shouldn't be going outside dressed like this. I step onto the sidewalk, take a few steps, stop and think about it some more, get concerned whether Lloyd and the woman can see me dithering through the window, take a few more steps past the window, stop again. Agonize a bit more, then give up and decide to go back. I walk down the drive next to the house, not looking at it so as they won't see me retreating, and pass the house till I come to the end of the building, where there's a carport and then another bit of matching building. At the back of this I turn in between the houses and meet a boy, maybe 10 or 11. He's new here, just hanging out, and I talk to him for a minute. [I find myself explaining to him how these houses are arranged, that this back part is a laundry (very nice, too, completely carpeted and even lounge furniture this end) that's shared by Lloyd and the guy behind him.]",Negative

Then I flew into a tree. He finally walked away disgusted and I sat in a small tree and a lion or big dog leaped at me, but it seemed as though the branches threw him back with a surprise. He was puzzled while he was that way. I climbed higher into the tree. I was in PA. and our toilets were overloaded. We ran water into them to get some of the waste washed out so it wouldn't pile up inside. We complained that the company didn't have them cleaned out.

I told Ray I was afraid because the car was going too fast. He said, ""Don't be silly,"" and we came to a bridge--the countryside was rustic and pretty--a little wood bridge and didn't make the corner and went off into the water, which was quite deep. We got out and I saw myself fluttering upward through the water, but Ray was staying to look for a valuable dress dummy we had with us and not finding, came to the surface only to see the dummy pop out of the water.

But anyway, I was nervous and afraid she wouldn't come because I didn't know how to behave with my boyfriend. He turned to look at me and hugged me. I was nervous and then told myself, ""He is my boyfriend,"" and so I kissed him and he leaned on my shoulder like a little boy.

"There are two railroad tracks going in different directions. I'm being chased. I hide under a table, a big round one with a long table cloth that goes to the floor. There is a hole in the floor and I go in there and someone covers it and makes it look ordinary. The man chasing me is very suspicious and looks over carefully, but the camouflage works. I then start running very fast around and around under that huge table in order to exercise and build up speed, strength and endurance so I can escape. My helper warns me not to run so close to the table cloth because as I bump it, it will give me away my presence to the man chasing me. Finally I am in good shape and I am ready. The cloth goes up and I sprint out down a huge aisle where an audience of people is painted on the floor. I run and run and have to be careful not to mistake the real audience for the painted one.",Negative
"It was night and my husband and I were coming back from some sort of function, and we were going out in the parking lot toward our car. I looked up and saw the moon in the sky and some distance away from it I saw another moon. I thought that was awfully strange. There were two girls walking along behind me and I asked them if they saw it too. They said they did. I thought, ""That just can't be so. One of these isn't really the moon."" As I thought this, one of them started getting larger, and sort of reddish. And I thought, ""Aha, this is some sort of meteorite or something that's going to come crashing down onto us."" So my husband and I got home and turned on the radio to see what the news would say about it. But nobody was saying anything about it. There was this girl commentator who said that she had a special news bulletin that all of Georgia and Louisiana and some other place were on fire, but she didn't elaborate on it. We got the idea that whatever was happening, they were trying to play it down. It was daylight now, and the sun was in the sky. When I put on dark glasses and looked at the sun, I saw that this thing that I had seen yesterday was impinging on it and was touching it and was about the same apparent size as it was. I mean, now I could see that this thing was round, but you could see a crescent outline on it, like a crescent moon. So I went back in and told my husband that I knew what that must be. It must be Venus, but I wondered why it was so big. I thought there was something strange going on.",Negative

"Interesting Eyebrows  My sisters Heather and Ramona and another woman are in a beauty competition together. It's possible that all three could end up in the same competition, on the same day, at the same time, in the same place, etc.... This would be interesting and unique, and for them, maybe monumental. This possibility seems to be a big deal.. They all sit on a couch. Ramona is on the left, Heather in the middle, and the other woman on Heather's right. Family members sit in between each of them. I note their eyebrows. Ramona's eyebrows are connected, and form the shape of a sine wave. Heather's eyebrows are meticulously plucked and arched, very thinly. The third woman's eyebrows are also connected, but they are not smooth like Ramona's: there is a jagged patch of eyebrow above the bridge of her nose.

I had moved into this huge house that was the same rent as here ($395 a week). I was looking for other people to move in because I could barely afford it on my own. There were three floors and I had chosen this big room with an ensuite as my room. There was also a kitchen per floor and about 10 rooms. There was another big room near the kitchen and also a smaller L-shaped room. I was trying to convince Tristan and Frederick to move in there and help find others but they didn't really want to. My room also had a door to this outside area with a private pool and spa. I was there by myself and I looked outside and saw a door was open and I was scared someone had broken in. I heard noises and realized there were people in the house. I locked my door and hid and told Tristan and Frederick to come over and help scare them off.,Negative

"In a house not known to me. I seemed to be waiting for someone. For some reason I left and went uptown to meet by chance my ex-girl's father (44). We talked a little bit, got along quite well, which was an exception, and then headed back for the house with him. Just from writing this, the house comes to me. It was his. I knew there was some ice cream in the ice box and he offered me some rootbeer. So I thought I'd combine the two for a Boston cooler. Dream faded.",Positive
"Mrs. Shelly  I arrive home. My friends Kevin Simpson and Jose Ramos live at my house. They are having a party later tonight. It's early now: 8:00 pm. I look around the house. My mom has left a note on the stove saying that my neighbor Mrs. Shelly needs food and money. My mom wants my roommate Stephen Ramos and I to go over and see Mrs. Shelly tomorrow morning. I'm with Kevin and Stephen in a house I don't recognize. It may be my or Kevin's house. We walk through it and talk. I talk to Kevin about his girlfriend. She has her period. I say they should have sex and he should just wash his sheets, which I know are dark green. I think this because he needs to wash he sheets anyway! Kevin has a book on the man who started making Busch Light beer. At the beginning of the book, the beer bottles have orange labels. There is a funeral in the book next, and then the man who started Busch Light beer.",Positive

"Esther Thurman Gives Birth  I'm with a group of people I know from high school. My friend Esther Thurman is there, and some of our mutual friends. We're in a gas station-like place. Someone mentions that Esther is having a baby! I look over: my view of her is partially obscured by an aisle. I see she is on the ground, fully clothed, in obvious discomfort. Someone makes a comment that makes Esther laugh. The laugh causes her to have the baby. It seems that something comes out of her birth canal though she is fully clothed. She makes painful noises, and writhes. She is then holding a baby that is five or six inches long, and very pale. It seems not fully formed or developed: an embryo. She holds it close to her head, bonding with it. I hold it. It isn't slimy like I thought it would be. It's like a doll, but more real. It shows no signs of life. There is a woman working in the gas station. I talk to her about getting something, like ice scrapers, as if we are entitled to them. I go outside with her and she takes two large plastic ice scraper-like objects from a vehicle, and gives them to me. I know she is stealing. I hurry to our vehicle, hoping the others come quickly. The others do come, but a man also comes claiming we have his ice scrapers. The scrapers are on the front passenger seat. We deny that we have them. I grab a hat or scarf and throw it on top of the scrapers near my feet. The man comes and looks, but leaves thinking we don't have them. We drive. Someone in our car is fleeing, maybe from that man.",Positive
"I was suppose to go to the psychiatrist office and there was a maze of hallways. The hallways were shaped like stiff angular letters of the alphabet. Some were dead ends. I was leading a horse down the hallway and sometimes he didn't want to go so I just had to wait for him. I was too early for the psychiatrist. I kept peeking into the offices on the hallway. There was a door about every 5 feet. A lady was at the desk. She handed me this big cup (like a big gulp cup) and said, ""We're going to test you for 3 chemical deficiencies."" I knew she meant for me to pee in the cup. I didn't say anything. I just kept looking at her like I understood what she meant, but when I opened the door to go to the bathroom, I walked away. Fast. I thought, ""Well, that certainly wasn't the psychiatrist office."" I walked back where I came from to find the psychiatrist. I was still leading horsey. I saw this office door and there was a second little doorway in front of the desk. Newspaper was taped 2/3 or 1/2 down over the doorway and you could see somebody's feet. I hadn't seen him before but I knew it was him.",Negative

"I'm at a small but full-serviced post office near my home. I'm at a tall table standing there getting letters ready. I mail the letters and a man comes in and puts a beautiful picture of a woman on the wall and a sign beside it as to how to mail and address a letter accurately. She is dressed in fairly tight violet or purple blouse that shows her contours, and a white linen skirt (?) ... and I adore her honey-brown hair and steady gaze. Suddenly, another man comes in and puts a ""Give Blood"" sign over the instruction sheet and her picture stays the same, and the blood bank honors Emma for many years of giving a rare B- blood. And then a second man comes in and places, on table beside me, a small steamer trunk with brass fittings that holds the vessels for the collected blood.",Negative
"Crumbling Antlers  I am deer hunting. A deer is running across a field. I am there. The deer is running towards me slightly. I think of shooting to make the deer run directly towards me, but I don't. I do fire, and I hit the deer. It is a big deer: it looks like a horse! It has six or eight antler tines. It runs into a nearby wooded and field area and falls down. I'm with my hunting party looking for the deer. We're in a house. It is pouring rain outside, really hard. Out in the field I see a lightning rod that is being continuously struck with lighting. People had just put the rod up early in the day. People also put blaze orange panels on the roof of a house, like insulation. I go into a small room, which is empty, dirty, wet, and tan in color. My party and I walk through a hunting camp while looking for our deer. There are two guys hunting, but not for deer. They point us to our deer, which is about 100 feet in a different direction. We see it, and go get it. Most of the deer's antlers have fallen off. It has only two big tines remaining, like an antelope. I think it must not be the one that I shot because that deer had a big six or eight point rack. My hunting partner Jose Ramos says the rack on the deer I shot was bigger than six or eight points. There are pieces of bone and antler on the ground from where the deer fell and hit the ground. The pieces are cracked and broken. The pieces look eroded, and have holes in them. I talk with Franco Ramos, another hunting partner, who says he could have hit that deer. I tell him he couldn't have hit the deer from where he was, on the edge of the field near the other woods. I show him where his shot ended up and where mine did, which is about 50 yards apart. His shot would have had to been about 200 yards. He accepts that I was the one who hit the deer.",Negative
"Just before the second awakening I dreamt that I knew I was going to be awoken, so I said to myself, ""Remember or start remembering everything that happens."" Well, the only thing that occurred was, right off the name was said, I can't remember it now, but I heard a name and I started to remember names. I said it to myself. Then I was awoken and was not able to remember before this point. Things vaguely come back like I recall seeing people flying in two-seater planes. I vaguely recall shooting pool with somebody else who I don't recognize or remember who. Again, prior to awakening, it seemed like the setting was confined to something that was closely recognized as a green in golf like my first dream.",Negative
"(01/27/01)[""Kalua.""] I am late getting to school. Enter a classroom where a man and a woman Perry and ? are lying on the floor chatting. We have a small pass along verbal exercises. I take part in them. I am the last one and make a sentence about Perry and ?. Now I am looking for a bathroom. I need to pee. On my way through the rooms, I pick up a small half full/empty glass coffee with Kalua in it. I ask a woman's permission to serve it to a group of men in a meeting room. As they are talking, I realize it is the Repertoire Theatre talking about doing one act plays. I want to talk with them about doing my plays. I ask the first man permission to pour him a small amount. I say I do mean small. I don't have much and hope it will go all around. He barely nods. I say the city gave permission and this is a restaurant so it must be OK. I go to each one and barely have enough to go around. For the last two the thickness is nearly solid. I put too much on one saucer and need to cut it to even it out.",Negative
"I was at an SAID meeting. I don't know where it was being held or why. I was sitting at a table talking with a group of people and there are other people in the same room but not part of our group. Aaron S is sitting alone at a table working on something financial for SAID, seems that it is related to budget. My group is discussing what Aaron S is working on and someone says that they don't think he is the right person to be doing that, implying that he isn't qualified or won't do it as well as someone else might. It is something that SAID has alot of trouble finding someone qualified who will do it. I was sitting there thinking that I am qualified and could do it well but that I would not like doing it at all. So, I decided not to say anything. Someone else said that they could do it well though no one responded, implying that they didn't agree. Some others agreed that it was quite a challenging task rather than telling this woman that they didn't have faith in her ability to do it well. As we continued talking I had an idea about exhibit space at the next conference. I reached kind of behind me to my right and grabbed a paper napkin to write on. I jotted a note to myself so I wouldn't forget to mention it at the appropriate time and then slid it under something so the person I was going to talk to about it wouldn't see it. It was something about using individual smaller rooms for some of the exhibitors. The person I was going to talk to about it was sitting next to me and noticed what I was doing. I told her that I had something to discuss with her later and smiled as I slid the napkin under the other object. She smiled back. One or two other people made comments and I just smiled. We continued with the group discussion.",Positive
"My boyfriend Jeremy was writing a book or a script.  He pitched or read it to me and a few other people.  I don't remember the plot.  The ending was not happy- it would be too stereotypical if it was a happy ending.  It was not impressive as a whole- turned down.  I thought it was okay but was confused about the third quarter of the story- he sort of rushed through that.  I took Jeremy to see a mystic.  She tried to help/train him.  There was a pile of glowing embers, very small flames near burning out.  She told him to raise the flames with the power of his mind.  He said he couldn't and wasn't really willing to give it a try in his skepticism.  She was encouraging him to try.  While she did this, I thought maybe if he could see it could be done, he would be more willing to try, so I raised the flames.  It was easier than expected, kind of like controlling the wind.  I had fun with it, raising and lowering them many times quickly in succession.  The woman was impressed with the ease and quickness with how I did it, thinking I was just another 'regular' person.",Positive

"My Creative Writing class was writing a story in Spanish and gave a copy to everybody, and everybody had to make an ending for it. The story was something along the line that there were these two brothers and I think they were friends, and they were like criminals. And they were taking a road trip up to this museum, and I don't think that they were going to steal anything, but they were going to confront somebody. I don't remember anything really about how the story went, but my ending that I was going to add was something like there was a third person that comes out of the woodwork that is the first person's brother and he doesn't know it. And those two were going to conspire to get the person and everything they had, and this guy was going to put butter all over his steering wheel and all over the handle of his gun so that anybody that, any cops that tried to take his car or anything wouldn't be able to keep a hold of the steering wheel.

"My radio alarm was going off. As I was listening to it play I was also working with or viewing the files I was receiving via the radio. There were different types of files. Some of them were images. I was looking at the different types of files. There was something specific about the image files that I was looking at, that included what extension they had. if they were tif's, jpg's or something else. The files were related to some kind of event and I had an agenda for the event. The files somehow correlated to the different segments of the agenda. I was moving the files around to make sure they were each associated with the right segment of the agenda. I think, at least at one point, I was talking to someone else. The time on one segment of the agenda said it began at 6:30. I suggested we change that to 6:45 because we would need to allow time for a change in the room setup before that segment. I wondered what we would do with everyone for that 15 minutes, where we would send them while the room setup was changed. I thought that people had done something similar for weddings and just sent everyone into a large hallway for that time and had refreshments out there for them while they waited. I realized I was going to need all these files on my computer and wondered how I was going to be able to transfer them from the radio to the computer. At first I didn't think it could be done but then I realized that it could. and how it could. So I relaxed and kept working.",Negative
"A car carrying two people inside pulls into the driveway of my house. The driver is a short, young woman who gets out of the car and walks to my front door where I am standing.

Then she explains that her passenger is ""X.'s wife"", i.e., the wife of my girlfriend's boss. She asks if I can drive the two of them to the airport. I hesitate. Then the passenger gets out of the car and comes to the door. She is a tall, attractive middle-aged woman. ""Pleased to meet you, Doctor Y."", she says to me gracefully.

I was then with someone else and they pointed out the church. It was 12:10, and I was supposed to have done whatever I was supposed to do by 12. It was dark. This guard/priest guy was outside and was watching us. Poppa explained what I had to do and that I had to go into the ""hold"". I forgot the rest of what he said though. The guard guy called the cops, so we ran and were jumping and running around for a while. We ended up jumping into the hold, but it wasn't really. We kept making noises and then they would hear us and we would have to run again. It was then daytime. It showed this lump of ground and it moved. Then it showed this lady outside her house being questioned by the cops. Then it showed this other cop holding a gun to this guy's head, who lived across from her. They were going to kill him if she didn't tell them what the ground was for. They were actually aliens. They lifted up the grass, and the ground underneath was really soft and they put their hands in and pulled out a big, old phone. Then I had a flashback of me talking on it to Poppa. One of the aliens said ""How long did you know?"" and the other said ""13 years"" and the other one said that he'd known for ""38 years"". My partner and I were in disguises leaning against a wall around the corner. There was a lake across from us, and we ran and jumped into it. We were swimming under the water looking for something on the bottom of the lake. The aliens were now swimming behind us. We reached the end, then I quickly leapt around to the other side, using the sides of the lake. The person I was with was then Autumn. They ended up taking my partner to see what I would do, but I ran and got into the car and drove. It was then dark and I didn't put the lights on and almost drove into the lake. I put my lights on, but I had ended up on this rocky wall and I couldn't get off it and I had to drive carefully. Some parts of it were snowy. Three years later, I got off. I went back to the town and got a motel room, which had no TV and the lady was offered me hers. I then went to Mom's, which was her house, but Nana was there. Dad and Ezra were there too.

I went to the booth and it was gone, a box of my stuff was sitting on the floor. Two women that I worked for took another female coworker and me to another room to train us on closing out the paperwork and money. I did the paperwork while the other woman counted the money. I had completed some of the papers earlier but had done them partially wrong. I saw that they had used a black marker and crossed out the info that was wrong. It was personal information, like maiden name and such I think. I had to recount the money to verify from the first woman. I had trouble doing that because she had put loose change and bills in with other money so I couldn't count it, but I didn't say anything.

"I Am Bambi  Bambi survives the winter. Bambi then sees other fawns grow, or grows himself. He goes down a path in the forest, downhill. The secret to the path is stealth: one has to see others before they see you. Bambi is on a rock cliff above a lake with a dock. I'm on the cliff. I am Bambi. There is a timber wolf on the dock. I howl, to see if the wolf will howl back. The wolf howls, and other wolves howl in the distance. I loose my footing and slip on the wood, and then climb back up. There are two Japanese tourists there. There are ducks there, and they may howl. I point emphatically to the tourists to photograph the wolf! The wolf jumps off the dock into the water and grabs a loon in its mouth. There are three or four other loons swimming there. There is a diver/cameraman, who may be the Japanese tourists. He clicks photographs of the wolf and the loon, one after another, without stopping.

"My wife Bonita and I were traveling in Russia, by train.  We were at the train station, which was much like a subway station, fiddling with a Falk-type map to see where we wanted to go (a bridge across some river to some island in the river -- I couldn't find it on the map), and another Falk map to figure out which train to take to get there.  It was really a mess.  I thought I had time to study it a while, but while I was looking at it, a train pulled in.  In the meantime, I had to exchange some money.  I had American coins in my left pocket, Russian in my right, and I was afraid of mixing them together.  I was standing at the exchange window while I was studying the maps, so I frantically began to try to figure out the exchange system, thinking it would be better, if possible, to exchange on a coin-for-coin basis.  There were several types of Russian coins on display there, but some were in kopecks and some were something else, besides being in different amounts.  There were also a lot of coins, including American ones, lying on the floor in front of the counter where people had evidently dropped them, and I couldn't resist wasting my precious time by picking some up.  We finally decided we had better get on the train before it left, even if we weren't sure it was the right one.  After we got on, I began trying to think of how to ask someone how to get where we wanted to go.  But I couldn't think of the word for ""station,"" nor the word and correct aspect for ""go"" in this case.  Norman was suddenly there, and he said ""station"" was ""some Russian word.""  I knew that meant ""man,"" but thought it might also mean ""station.""  I asked him whether it took the preposition and what  he said didn't sound right to me.",Negative
"I was at a shop and got a haircut. I left there and went to another shop and this lady told me that there was a job for a statistics person near a video shop/cinema. I had to this strange online quiz thing. There was like a bush scene and I had to press a button when certain people popped up (like a shooting range). I clicked the wrong person and I tried to restart it but it was too hard and I left. There was a black cop/security guard for the video shop and he had accused me of stealing chips before. Then there were zombies. I was with a bunch of people including Dawson, Joey and Jack (all from Dawson's Creek). I can't remember the beginning but we were in a bathroom. There was a zombie tied up. For some reason we all decided to have a smoke. Joey and I went into the shower and I took a puff of the smoke and I didn't choke or cough. The cop came and told us off and made us leave. As he told us off, the others took off into a stairwell and I followed them. I then realized they had run off because zombies were coming so I thought it was lucky that I had followed them. We were in like an underground carpark before we got to the stairwell. I was running really fast up the stairs and then I noticed that everyone had stopped and I realized there were heaps of zombies coming down the stairs. We ran through a door on that level and there was another stairwell across the room. We started running towards it and there were lots of zombies in the way. They were all doing different things, like one was doing the dance from 'Thriller' and other things from the game, Plants vs. Zombies. We started climbing up this thing on the wall. We had to move across it to get out. I was holding onto this small unstable bit hanging out of the wall. Underneath us were lots of zombies and they were reaching up to us. We complained and Jen (Dawson's Creek) got angry because she had the hardest job and she went across to the end, using up all the good spots (which fell off after being used), but I went across. I got to the end and the key was like a contact lens and I dropped it in the crowd of zombies. Dawson and Jack somehow managed to wipe out the whole room. I jumped down and it was much easier to get everything done. I was covered in blood and started wiping it on Dawson's back, which he let me do and we joked about it. He offered to someone there to join our group and said he had ""nine contacts"", such as a weapons dealer.",Negative
"I'm in my apartment, maybe asleep, but I've been in the bedroom a while and I have a funny feeling about someone being in the other room, I'd better check. I picture in my mind some things being gone, like the TV. But I go in and find almost everything gone - the shelves, even, that the TV was on - all wiped out, silently, while I was asleep. I'm sad, at a loss - I feel bereft and don't know what to do. It's as though this was visited on me as a kind of punishment or justice. I walk around a bit but mostly just look at where things have been, thoughts running through my mind, like, I wonder if I'll get the things back - what will I do to replace them - will I be able to replace them - I feel exposed, stripped, violated, taken. I go back into the other room.",Negative
"(02/27/97)[""Walking from California.""] I am at a V. family reunion. We are in some house. People are arriving and we are greeting each other. Then they take their food dishes into another room. I see Darcy wearing a perky beret hat. We chat surface things. I see Aunt Charlotte. Some of Dale's kids. Finally, I go to join them in the other room only to discover they have already finished eating and hardly any food is left. It is all packed up to return with them and people are saying their goodbye's. I am quite amazed. I comment that usually people would come and eat for hours and talk and linger over coffee. But everyone seems briskly intent on getting this over with. I forage around looking for some food, as I am hungry. I find a few packages in a large glass cupboard, like you see in a florist's shop. Now I am walking back home, which apparently is in my state and I apparently am in California. I am walking down a long straight country road. Sagebrush all around. I am a bit worried because I am going a new route. I am headed for L/, my state. I come to a tiny town and find a road sign. It says 44 more miles to the my state border. I decide to take a bus the rest of the way, since I am confused about the route. I have to go to the bathroom and ask a woman at the bus depot coffee counter where one is. I look around and find doors, but not one that indicates it is a restroom. She points to one behind her counter but says it's for employees. I am adamant that I must go now. I use it. It is very small and I pee into a narrow metal container screwed into the wall. I get on the bus and it is very crowded. I see some empty seats ahead of me, near the middle part of the bus and rush, like all the others are to grab one. The seats are facing long ways toward the windows.",Negative
"I was studying on a corner and suddenly I dreamed about elephants again (like the last time), even though these were smaller. Then I saw Mary's mother (the girl I am I love with, but to whom I haven't spoken yet). She walked towards me, looked at me and she quickly went away laughing. Then her daughter Mary came out, looked at me and smiled and I smiled back. Then she took my hand and told me that she loved me. As it was late, she said goodbye to me and asked me for a date (then I laughed and laughed because I remembered that once my friend Louie had asked me whether I was waiting for her to tell me she loved me and then ask me for a date). Although I didn't want that, I cried later.",Negative
"I heard someone say, ""Yes, go ahead; why sure,"" to my answer. I wanted to dream if Approval would win again. I was an usher in church. I passed the basket and Jimmy Clear gave me $21 to donate to the church and he said he wanted a receipt and I told him I would get it for him. A fellow had two bags of money and was going to put into a wall safe. There was some kind of trough and bottle of whiskey in it. I poured some good whiskey into it and told Martin Kmetzs to give me a pint of it when it was aged about 10 years. I was overexposed. I just had an undershirt on and I was in school. I walked by two girls and my penis was exposed and I was conscious of it. One girl stopped to talk to me and I leaned against her leg and tried to hide my penis. It started to get hard and hot. We talked about shoes. I told her how our shoes got dirty working on the coke yard. I heard ran when I awoke, then no, no, no. I was working on the coke yard with Grandpa and we were looking for an extra oven to pull, but it was getting time for me to go home and change to go to school.",Negative
"I was at 'Mom's'. There was a bull ant running around the house. I needed one for school and so instead of killing it, everyone was trying to catch it. They were really dangerous. Some boy wet his pants and the floor was really wet. I had told Mr Quinlan that Ezra said he'd seen him with Mom and he said it wasn't true. I said that I didn't think it was. I was in Mom's room and I saw the ant. She caught it with her fingers and I had to get a Milo tin with this spiffy lid. Someone pricked my finger and it hurt.",Negative
"2. I'm walking around outside a beautiful blue-ceilinged second story room that belongs to Nikita Kruschev. I see him walking around, and I want to see him about something, but I can't risk going in, but I wish he would recognize me and send out for me. That would make it alright. I feel sorry for him cooped up the way he is in one room, even though he's the force of a whole country. I'm thinking that one would be willing to sacrifice a lot to be the head of a government (this must have something to do with the president's job that I was offered during that month that I was then thinking of taking).",Negative
"I remember my brother taking my little electric diary thing and stomping on it over and over again. Then I remember I was crying and brought it to my dad and somehow he got it to work.

I said ""That's what I always say!"". I went back inside and there was a little gecko in the games room chasing me around. There was a yellowy lizard in the sink, which had appeared before I went out the back. I was rinsing out a bowl with hot water but changed to cold because I didn't want to hurt the lizard.",Negative
"Wally Slept Next To Annie  I'm at Lake Jefferson in Wilmerton playing pool with my brother Wally and others. The pool table is on the north/northeast side of the lake, about where the stream flows in. I see the Thomas family arrive in the distance: Bill, Tamara, Tina, Jessica, and a female I think is my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, but then realize she is Tina's friend. Jessica walks up to the pool table. I don't say anything to her, putting on my ""cool"" persona. She talks to Wally mostly, and some to me. She says that Annie and Wally slept next to each other from the 23rd to the 29th. I know that Wally wouldn't double-cross me: he wouldn't do anything sexual with Annie, so I'm not worried about it.",Negative
"(01/30/00)[""Loving the rock star.""] Dovre and I are across the street from a rock concert. The lead singer sees me and walks over to me, still singing. We sit together lovingly, cuddling. Then he walks back on stage and finishes the song. After the concert, he comes out looking for me. He is a silent man who loves me and is attracted. I enjoy him also. We need to stand close and touch. We kiss. The kiss is a bit closed and uncomfortable, but the sexual anticipation is building. He leans against me as we are up against a wall. It is wildly sexual now. Feels hot and passionate. Dovre is a bit jealous that she is the younger woman and is being ignored and then she sees it makes me happy and feels fine about it. Now I am in a shower and feeling the sensual pleasure of it. He peeks in and I say to him, get naked and come here. He does and we make wild love. Orgasm. It was great.",Positive
It was a dream where I was at a pizza place and this guy was outside with a bike and he was kind of chubby and it was really hot outside and sunny. Two of my friends were outside with me and they keep telling me that the guy on the bike liked me and thought I was cute. But he was ugly and I didn't want to like him. One of my friends liked the boy on the bike and tried to get with him and for some reason I was getting jealous even though I had no interest in the guy on the bike.,Positive

"Big Resort Area Fishing Farm  There is a fishing camp up where I am somewhere in the Big Resort Area. The camp has huge shallow ponds filled with different types of fish. I see many northern pike ponds that are about an acre large. There are a lot of dead fish floating, but many more alive in the pond. People go here to fish, and pay by the pound for the fish they catch. There are price boards in the little store there, for how much it costs to fish. I meet a man that works at the store who is about my age. I think that I'd love to have his job. He says something to me about two-on-two volleyball, which some of the summer employees in the Big Resort Area were going to do. I ask him how big the fish are in the ponds. He says they get three pound smallmouth bass, and that the northern pike don't get very big: they eat fast or something like that. I see his living quarters, which are simple and neat. An older man tells him to use his shotgun to fix part of one of the cabins or houses there. The young man shoots a grenade-like bomb into a window, which blows up the room it lands in. I don't think he realizes what happened. I get a note later saying that it was blown up.",Positive
"Jeff and I were sitting in the Pillbox discussing a physiology course. We were sitting there for a while and decided we didn't particularly like some of the lectures and we weren't clear. Dr. Paff came in and said that he was going to lecture next week on neurophysiology, and I had kind of ambivalent feelings about this. I felt maybe that he shouldn't lecture, but if he did, it would be clearer. I'd understand the lecture better than the lectures we've been having so far. We were sitting in the Pillbox. The Pillbox is a little meeting area where they have tables and chairs and there's a little place where you can buy sandwiches at the Medical School. I had ambivalent feelings toward Dr. Paff because I was afraid of his grading and his attitude, his aggressive attitude, although I do like his way of teaching better than the lectures we've been getting which are kind of fuzzy, not understandable. Dr. Paff left. This is the last thing I remember in the dream. We were sitting there around one of the formica tables there in the Pillbox and Chuck and I were both in our school clothes, white pants and shirt, and Dr. Paff was in his usual attire of blue--blue tee shirt and blue pants. When he left, he put on his little straw hat. The strain was largely day residue. The physiology we were discussing, we just had a physiology test and we spend most of our off time in the Pillbox, being a coffee shop we go in there and have coffee every day. We were in there today.",Negative

"I was with mother and daddy and one of my sisters at my parent's house. He was explaining to me and my sister that we were going to have to take care of mother. I don't know if this was a one-time thing, or if he was preparing us to take care of her, should he be the one to die before her. This obviously made me and my sister very uncomfortable, the idea of having to take care of her colostomy. She was laying in her bed, on her back, completely undressed, and covered with a blanket. He was explaining how we would have to turn her over to her side. Before he started showing us how to take care of her colostomy, she got up and walked away. I was surprised that it didn't bother her to get out of bed completely unclothed in front of myself and my sister.",Negative
"The only thing I remember is that I and my two brothers were in the dining room at my home, but the funny thing is that the guys who were supposed to be my brothers are two friends of mine; one of them is 24 years old, more or less, he's short, like my brother, thin, wears glasses, and he is a very nice boy. The other one is a classmate at the university, about 20 years old, fat, and also very nice and smart. Another thing was that, though I have one brother and one sister, in the dream it looked as though I had two brothers. We were sitting in the dining room with my mother, and it seems that something had happened because one of my supposed brothers was giving her money and the other one and I were crying. This is the only scene I remember. I don't remember dialogues or anything else because at the moment I awoke.",Negative

I look and there are lots more but they've fallen on the floor, the messy greasy floor. I'm crying as I pick them up because I know if she sees, I'm in trouble. I have a hard time picking them up. Finally I get them into the house, and she comes up to me and growls, ""Hurry up. They're in there, hungry, tired and fighting,"" (My father and the rest of the family). I say, ""I have to cook the potatoes first,"" and she says, ""No! Do something about the hamburgers first. Feed them the hamburgers and then come cook the potatoes."" She walks out. I'm crying and angry and I get stubborn. I look for the potato peeler in the sink of dirty dish water. All I keep coming up with are sharp knives. I'm careful with them. I peel the potatoes and get them into a pan and take them to the stove, move another pot off the burner to make room for the potatoes and see that a cooked steak is there. There are lots of them, 3. She comes back in. I say, ""Look! You had a good dinner already cooked and you had me out there working and crying and you weren't even going to let me have a good dinner."" She yells at me about finding some other place to live. I say, ""Yes, sure, I'll get out."" She storms out. My father says to me (he's standing behind me), ""7-6-5-4 yeah, you could be packed and out by 5."" I know he means a.m. and I don't get up early, and I get furious at him and I turn and yell, ""You little short runt!"" Dwight is standing nearby. My father is about 4 feet tall.

The house was part of the house I live in now, because I remember the dining room table, sitting in the kitchen and I remember that suddenly the house changed and it was the house I had previously lived in and there was all kinds of stuff that was in that house that should have been in that house, but the floor and the walls, that I actually touched, were of the house where I am living in now.

"I was going shopping with some of my family, Matthew, Mother, Bill F. I thought BJ was there at first but not later. We came outside and were standing on a landing that was 4-5 feet higher than the ground and had a wrought-iron railing. We were looking down at a car. I don't know whose it was. They said they didn't think it would be a good idea for them to drive because the car was small to begin with and then they also had a lot of stuff in it. I said that was fine and that we could take my car. Matthew was going to drive. I went to get in the front passenger seat. I came around the back of the car and just as I did I saw that Mother had gotten in there and Bill F was in the backseat behind her. So I went back around to get in the other side of the backseat. I'm driving and Mother is in the front seat with me. I went to pull out onto a very busy street. For the most part Mother is nervous about being in a car regardless of who is driving so I didn't let it bother me that she was nervous with me driving. I was going to pull out to the left. I looked both ways and started to pull out, thinking that she would tell me if I didn't see something coming from the right. By the time she said it was clear I was already out in the road. Immediately after I pulled out I noticed there was a lot of road construction ahead of me. Lots of rows of orange construction cones to keep cars from using parts of the road and others to designate where the temporary lanes where. I found this confusing and I was getting anxious. I wasn't sure where to go, especially when I approached a fork created by the cones. By the time Matthew told me which fork to take I had already taken the right one, but it was the wrong one. I said it didn't matter. I was going to go up to where I could pull off and let him take over driving.",Negative
"I can't remember properly, but I think it was the future. I went into a classroom and everyone was very emotionless and I thought it was like The Invasion (saw a glimpse of it on TV last night). I copied them and this guy was next to me and he was also playing along. A teacher was keeping an eye on us. They gave us work to do. They realized the guy was faking and then they were suspicious of me as well. If you killed them, they would regenerate in a chair. If you got them at the start, and pulled off their head that would be the end (they were sort of Cylon like). I stabbed the teacher and they regenerated in a chair at the front of the class and I pulled their head off and eventually they disappeared. A girl at the front of the class said something so I threw a chair at her. They were all left. There was an episode of Red Dwarf and Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was in it. I was reading about the actress and she was born in 1944 and I was telling Mom said she was 50 in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and I was shocked.",Negative

We had to chase it so we could put it in the cage. It was clawing our bodies and making us bleed. Each time it would claw us, the lion cub seemed to grow in size. It grew to be bigger than the owner's house. We had to put a search light out to find the lion even if it was huge. We were all scared and were hurting from the claw marks. Paul took me and we went to a store. There in a barbed fence was my cocker spaniel. He had a sad expression on his face and Paul and I felt sorry for it, so we let it go, and then it started to bite us. Once again as it bit us it grew in size..

Now I am her and I look far down at the small and distant audience. The billowing curtain nearly knocks me off stage. I keep hissing at the curtain woman to open the curtains a bit more.

"This is very sketchy but important. It had something to do with the CAS office. My sense is that there were people who came to work there but either decided that they couldn't do the job, so they left, simply because they knew they couldn't or because they knew they couldn't and they wanted to make the decision to leave before they were asked to leave. There were people who couldn't do the job and were asked to leave, or maybe it was suggested that they leave. It wasn't the typical office setting. I have this picture in my mind of people along two opposing walls. They aren't really standing in a row. they are but there is a significant space between each one. as though there is a room for a desk between each of them. They are just standing there. I don't remember any furniture in the room. It seems that it had something to do with changing clothes. Maybe I was changing clothes. I realized. Or. I don't know. For some reason I'm noticing about the fact that I have shaved off my pubic hair.

Audrey jumped on a rock. It moved on the water, then turned into a yacht. Bob had the captain's cap on. I took it off his head, then I put it back on and let him be captain. He said, ""Plug up the holes,"" and the crew did it. Our TV was on a blink. I noticed tube no. 9 was the one.",Negative
"I live in a very large shared house with several other people. It's an old victorian building with several several stories and rooms in the roof. We may be students, because we have piles and piles of records. There was previously a flood here, and all the stuff got destroyed. It's pelting down with rain outside, and the river has burst its banks again. Brown water is rising gradually. We panic and move all the stuff to the attic. There's chaos in the house, and arguments break out.",Negative
"I was at my dad's house packing up to leave. Some women were downstairs waiting to take me to the airport. I yelled to them I would be down in a minute. I had some things I needed to get together. I realized that I was taking a long time and I was afraid I would miss my flight, but my things were in major disarray and there were a lot of things I couldn't find. I went downstairs and the room was set up like an auditorium with rows and rows of fold-up chairs. I was crawling around underneath the chairs like they were a tunnel, finding all sorts of things that I had lost.",Negative
"I am looking at an ornate picture that Paulina has drawn. I say to Kenneth, ""Look at this. There is something sweet about her drawing,"" (ability). Then I see she is tracing pictures. I look again at her pictures and reassure myself there is still some original creativity there because after she traces the form, she adds her own work inside it. I see the outline of a woman and a crude, but compelling face like my drawing in art class. I see another drawing of ""Rose,"" a woman who looks like me, that Rochelle drew. Someone says, ""Look, it looks like you in the face."" Rochelle must have been thinking of me when she did it, perhaps unconsciously. I want to hold ""Rose"" and meditate for answers to what I'm doing to myself. I do so and I see a rolling muddy river with sticks in it. I laugh because I realize the symbols mean ""she is beating herself up."" The sticks then turn to turmoil and I know this means, ""She is being shitty to herself, the trend.""",Positive
"I was at some sort of family party.  It was dark..possibly outdoors.  Someone asked my cousin Alice a question and she answered in the third person.  Someone mentioned something in regards to her answering in third person.  I said, ""oh yea, that can be fun sometimes.""  There were blue slates of cinderblock-like material around the silverware on the table outside.  I had to go to the bathroom and sat on a toilet near a pillar- it was open space and there were people around.  When I pulled my underwear down I tried concealing the evidence that I was on my period.",Negative

I need to be on that flight after flight 117. I miss the plane. My dad calls. He leaves a message on the answering machine saying, ""Go out on the dock."" I feel like a total and complete idiot: a fool! I am completely discouraged. I think I've screwed up my life severely.  I'm on a bus with my friend Stephen. There is a frozen pond next to the road.

"A lady that I work with gave me a ride home. When we left work there was a very light, fluffy snow falling. I could feel it as I walked on it. It was about 4:15, the time we get out of work and she said ""oh, I'll give you a ride home"" and so I said ""Okay"", and when we got home, it was a Monday. My niece was there when I got home and she said ""oh I didn't go to work today, but I'll go tomorrow"" and I was thinking it wasn't fair that she got the day off and I didn't. Then I went to do laundry and somehow somebody had been using the washing machine, but they had it on hold. And I had to figure it out. I don't know how they had set it up, it was kind of mixed up, but we went over there and fixed it up.",Positive

I see Nate and Rochelle sitting on the front porch. Nate has sunglasses on. He sees me and smiles. I try not to respond. I feel a warm sense of happiness at seeing him and I'm thinking, ""I don't want to see you."" We go around the block. I'm teaching her how to drive. Now it's crowded. I say, ""Slow down, be careful."" She says she can't stop because of the water. I look but I don't see any water. I get out and go to a store. I find some of my belongings out in front. I pick them up and also see a beautiful pair of earrings. I think of taking them too. A woman comes by and says, ""Are you taking my earrings?"" I say, ""Certainly not. It's just that my finger got stuck while I was looking at them!"" I find another pair, they look Indian, no clips. I ask the store owner if they can be fixed. She says, ""No.""",Positive

"This girl and her boyfriend ended up with this dude. I don't remember properly, but Pete Wentz was in a van along with them and the guy's sister. It was then dark and Pete and the sister disappeared. They were trying to find the guy's sister. They went through McDonald's drive thru, but the van was too big so they went back and got a smaller car. Then they were at the guy's house. The girl had now fallen in love with him. Her boyfriend was going through all these trapdoors trying to get out and to find the guy's sister. His girlfriend and the guy were trying to kill him. At one point the boyfriend came up through a trapdoor and his girlfriend pointed a gun at him. Then they were in an underground place that looked like an abandoned Royal Show and they were near some show bag stalls. All these people that the guy had killed were hanging on hooks with posters of them next to them. Pete Wentz and the sister were down there. It had then been a movie, and Dad said ""he wasn't there earlier"", as he had thought Pete Wentz hadn't been in the movie at all.",Positive

Sherry says she has a class with Annie. There are many shorthaired women there. My dad and I talk to Bill Thomas. I try to avoid Annie. My dad takes out his checkbook to make a deal with Bill regarding Annie and I. Annie comes towards me happily. I turn and direct myself towards her when I realize she's approaching. She is wearing blue and is happy. She happily says that she and I are going to take a 10-minute walk. I guess my dad bought or bargained with Bill for me to have 30 minutes with Annie. There is a boat in front of their house. A motor is in the boat. The boat is old and run of water: run down. Annie drives slowly out of the driveway in a small green car, ready to go on a walk. My dad follows in a car. I'm walking. I motion with my hand for them to go by me and keep going because something is not right: the timing or a distraction.

"I was in my parent's old house and it looked somewhat like the basement did, the whole house was really dark and there was some sort of gathering of S people (a social club, a refuge for survivors of abuse). And there were like people everywhere and I was wandering around, listening to different groups talking, and finding out who they were and the basement was sort of dimly lit with a kind of yellow incandescent bulb in the ceiling. And there were people sitting on the stairs I knew, some friends I knew from college. That was really weird, and so I stopped to talk to them for a while and then I went upstairs into this kitchen which wasn't my parents' kitchen. And it was really dark in there with candles and stuff lit and there were these people and one of them I recognized as being a member of S. Guess they probably all were but, I recognized one who goes by the name Shadow Dancer. And he said something about do you want to join us and for some reason I had it in my head that they were witches and I wanted to belong but I didn't want to be part of it even though I didn't think they were doing bad magic. Anyway, I didn't like the idea of witchcraft of any sort and I said ""no""...

He told me that I could shake his hand any time. Then my dad, Robin, and I were in a room. My dad had a bag full of Rune Stones, that he was showing to Robin. I was somewhat miffed because my dad isn't really much of a mystic and I felt like he was trivializing something that I valued. I made some kind of patronizing remark and my dad angrily stormed out of the room. He was pissed off that I had made him look foolish in front of Robin Williams, who he wanted to impress.

My Mother was there, and I was surprised that she called the other woman by her first name-Jane.

"I don't know why I'm getting like this, but this morning when my alarm came on, I jumped up and I was kind of afraid that, I got real nervous because I thought I missed the lab. And it took me a minute to remember and sort out the confusion that Sunday night I got to sleep all night and this is Monday morning, and that Monday night was going to be my next lab. And I had to remember that Saturday night was my last one. I hope I don't do that next month if my labs are during the day. That's going to be crazy. But anyway, I had a dream last night that I had a class on the second floor of Modern Media College's building, which in Building 1 there aren't that many classrooms on the second floor. There's mainly administrative offices up there. But in my dream there was like classroom after classroom just like there is in a public school. And so I had a class up there and we were doing some kind of droop (?) work and all of a sudden we had a fire drill and it sounded like a high, shrill 1000 cicadas kind of alarm that you hear at the Media Center at Westport High School. And so there was this fire escape like type thing that was this metal stairway thing that led out the back way that we could go down. And it was so loud back there! I think I might have covered my ears, and it was still so loud, but not only was the alarm loud, there was some kind of water sprayer going on out there that was really loud. And then all of a sudden it all stopped, but there was like water at the bottom of the stairwell that would beep, and you had to swim across it to go to the little field area where you were supposed to stand. And I didn't really have a problem swimming; it was that the water smells and I didn't want to swim in the smelly water and get it all over me. So I got down in it and I went a little ways, and then I turned around because I decided that I didn't want to, and I was going to go back up the stairs and wait for people on the stairwell. All of a sudden all of these thorns started showing up on the railings and some even on the steps, so I figured, okay, I guess I'm, I waffled for a little bit, and I think I finally went over to this place where people stand. And then the whole class was gone. There was just one or two girls over there, and they were talking about how they made a pregnant Barbie or something, but they had to make a rap song along with it that proved its father was there somewhere. And they made a DVD about it too. [laugh] And that's when I woke up.",Negative

Matthew had either called or came home and was upset. He was telling me that Ashley B had decided to break up with him.

Tesar came over and he took one small hole with a damper on it and took off the damper and made a draft which got the fire burning. He then put some coal on it and he had a good fire going.",Negative
"In the dream I had very easy control with telekinesis.  Pushing something around on the sidewalk, hooking the clasp of a necklace without hands, floating a towel somewhere.  There was a picture book of insects, and I could make the pictures move.  There were small helpless birds on the ground.  I picked them up and held them.  I got used to the telekinesis and flew up through the clouds.  They felt fluffy and icy, yet not really there.  They didn't have any particular flavor, but they tasted good somehow.",Positive
"(12/13/01)[""Dress size too large.""] I am in a store. The woman clerk brings me a few dresses to try on. I see they are very large and very colorful. Not my usual style of colors. But I try one on. The clerk insists that the dress is the right size. It is an 18. I say no, I wear a 16 or even a 14. I put it on and show her how loose it is with plenty of room to spare. I take it off. Now I look through the racks and can't find any other dresses to try on. I am also looking for things for Charla. Then Dwight and Jake are there. I say something to Jake who is being non cooperative. A man sitting near him asks him why he isn't being helpful to me. Jake says grumpily if you want to be my friend, don't tell me what to do. I have to return a phone device I bought. I assure Dwight that I will pay for it if I have to so he won't get stuck with the bill, since he put it on his visa card for me.",Positive
"Carrying my golf clubs, I walk to a ""Mr. Messengers"" house. On this trip, there seems to be nobody home. In the backyard stands a one-story frame building, possible a woodshed. Having a key to the door I unlock it, enter the building, and sit down on a box. There are at least 2 rooms, and the floor is of wood. I begin to write out my dream of previous night which was as follows: It is 2 p.m. I am in my bedroom dressing, just putting on shoes. Glancing out of window I notice a lady and several children on the street. The lady looks in my direction and, because both shades are up, probably sees me; or so I think. (This ends the dream of a dream). On a second trip to Messengers I find construction work in progress. Dirt is being dumped onto a terrace in front of house. A large truck, loaded with dirt, takes a running start in order to climb the short but steep bank of the terrace. The truck gets up all right but very nearly continues on into yard. The driver, however, by applying the brakes suddenly and hard stops the truck just in time. He then sticks his head out, looks .... the truck passed. The tree appears to be uninjured. There is a bed of flowers on the terrace and the workmen are removing (for transplanting in their own yards) the flowers just fast enough to keep ahead of the dirt dumping. A black man is speaking of a certain plant which he wants. It is dark, almost black, in color, with richly (deep) colored flowers. It looks like a black petunia.",Negative

"It looks like I'm at my birth home but it was___ Alan K was a doctor and he had left a message for me saying that he wanted to talk to me about something, I don't think it was medical at all. He wanted my help with something. I had gone there to pick up Matthew. He was a baby. I think 2 years old or less. He had a rash all over the front of his legs and arms. I was debating whether or not to go see if Doctor Pf could fit him in or to call, or just talk to Alan K since he was a doctor and right there. I called his office instead to see if he could take a look at it. As I called him he answered the phone. Since it was me he told me that he wanted to schedule that appointment to talk about the other thing. Then he asked me why I was calling. I told him it was because of Matthew's rash and I was hoping he could look at it. He kind of passed it off like it was no big deal. I just said that I was concerned that it was measles or something because it was so bad. He finally came out and looked at it. By the time he looked at it there was almost nothing there. I said that was really odd because it was much worse than that just a couple of minutes ago. I wondered if it was an allergic reaction to something I was wearing, because when I was holding him and he was close to me it got really bad. Before that there was also something going on with me and I was thinking that if I called Doctor Pf he could just see the both of us. Whatever it was that was going on with me I didn't want to talk to Alan K about.",Negative

The picnic was to be the very next day. I drove home and was looking the car over in the backyard when my dad, 54, appeared.

"My wife Bonita and I were on a ship, maybe The President, when an emergency arose similar to that in a previous dream, possibly also a fire.  As before, we suspected that something was wrong some time before the official notification.  Water was almost to the edge of the decks when the order came over the PA system:  ""Lower the lifeboats, Congressmen.""  I didn't know whether that meant they were supposed to do the work or to be the first ones aboard.  I assumed the latter, which sort of irritated me.  Actually, though, everyone pitched in to lower them, and children were the first ones put aboard.  The lifeboats were very small -- not much bigger than a bathtub -- and it took so long to lower them that I began trying to figure out what we should do if we found ourselves in the water.  I had a hand in lowering one boat.  It was actually pulled by a rope along a sort of wire frame or net along the side of the boat until it got to the desired location.  A young girl or boy got it started, to my left, and I passed it on to a group of women and children to my right.    Again the transition is hazy.  We might have gone right over the edge on to dry land.  At any rate, we found ourselves in a yard sort of like Grandpa's back yard except larger, and bounded by woods rather than fence, and there was a group of elephants coming through a gate (maybe there was a fence after all.).  There were two or three very cute small ones and a half dozen or more adults.  While we were watching them in amazement at how close we could come to them (I even considered trying to ""kidnap"" one of the babies, but was prevented from getting too close by a mother who kept pushing me away with the end of her trunk), my daughter Christina wandered in among them.  I was horrified when I noticed, because although they seemed docile enough, I knew they could accidentally step on her.  But every time I tried to get through to her, they blocked my way threateningly, as if protecting their own young ones.  I gasped in horror as one started to lie down near Christina and almost lay right on top of her.  Fortunately, though, it was somewhat immobilized as a result, and I was able to rush up and snatch her away.",Negative

I ran up this ramp, which led into this room where you had to jump across beds to other beds. I did so to get to this bed near the wall (far away, less likely for the zombies to get there). Everyone was impressed at how I got there. The beds were very high up (like 3 storeys or so). I got down and some guys took it while I was gone. I left there to find a new spot.

I didn't shoot because I said someone could walk up to the top of those stairs just as I shot and I could shoot them, and sure enough someone did, some children. So I pointed the gun at any there target and I noticed some children around this tree, so I didn't shoot again. I didn't want to frighten the children. The sun was shining.",Negative
"I was wandering through the rooms of a mansion. There were all these exquisitely decorated secret rooms. This one room I found had a four-poster bed with a white lace comforter and canopy. There was a fireplace and a Jacuzzi in the middle of the room. Then I found myself sleeping in a sleeping bag on the floor in a garage. A woman had come in and woke me up. She was angry. She said, ""What are you doing in my house?"" Then Julie came in and told her that it was OK, that I had her permission.",Negative
"I am at the University, walking through tunnels, underground catacombs. All students have to go through them, sort of a safety measure. I come out to a class in French drama and sit very high up, looking down where I see a French woman actress; I want to be like her. After class I meet a woman friend who thanks me for being such a good friend.",Positive
"The Key  I'm scuba diving alone. Ice covers the surface of the water. I slide through a small hole on my mission. I sink down into the dark and realize I forgot the light. I swim back up to the hole and remove the hole cover to get a light. But no one gives me a light. I create a light in my hand. I make it through a chicken coop-like area. I can't breath well at first, but this gets easier. I think of how hard it would be to share a mouthpiece underwater. I see the key that is my goal to obtain. Cautiously I move the key towards me: I don't want to just walk in the room where the key hangs. I get the key and run! My friends Nate Nelling, Tom Napper, Emily Zates, and others are there. We run in a chicken coop-like area. The floor is dust, dirt, cobs and chips. The ceiling is very low. There are pool tables in this subterranean-like area. We move quickly. The ceiling becomes lower: we crawl. We get to an ""out"" door for August. I've gone too far: I was supposed to exit at July. I exit here. I follow Nate out, squeezing through a small square space. As I emerge a woman is there. We're in a workplace area. She asks and I tell her about my disability: I have come back just to look, not to work. My mom and my brother Wally are there. We're going to leave. I pack up my dirty laundry. There is a woman with colored stamp pads. I put on my Redson basketball shirt and my red checkered shorts. I turn my shorts around, because they're on backwards. My grade school principal, Candy Bevner, sees this.",Negative
"No Physics in High School  I'm with my classmate Allie Crater and others in a trench with a fence on one side. We want to get over the trench. We talk about the classes that we had in high school that would prepare us for cellular/molecular biology in college. I say that I had no biology, but more importantly no physics! Allie acts a bit surprised: I get fleeting sympathy. We are on some train tracks or in or around a trail tunnel. A train is coming and we need to move. I hop out of the way. Allie and the others take longer to move. I encourage them to move, and they finally do. I'm in a room sitting on a bed. My sort-of girlfriend Stephanie Peterson is there, with others. She says to me that she won't stay over at my house on Saturday or Sunday. This is her way of saying she is going to restrain herself on these days and see how things look on Monday, in terms of our relationship.",Positive
"I am at a lunch counter in some railroad station, probably the one in Nearby City near my hometown (though the ""dream"" counter is not in same part of station as the actual counter is). Some man, identity uncertain, is with me. We have waited a long, long time for our lunch, and are beginning to think that the cook has gone on his vacation. My companion had ordered a hamburger sandwich, and I a cup of coffee and a dish of something else. Finally, a waiter brings our food, but in setting the dishes before us gets our orders transposed. He then changes them. The dish I ordered seems to contain a small pile of mashed potatoes, and a considerable amount of gravy in which are floating small objects that may be crackers. Leaving the lunch counter I walk out on platform and see 3 engines on about the 3rd and 4th tracks. Two of them are small, insignificant, but the other is a large one, and as I approach it from the front it seems to have a ""shell"" covering nearly all the numerous protuberances (air pumps, sand box, bell, steam chest, etc.) of ordinary locomotives. This, however, proves to be an illusion, for closer inspection shows the engine to be a dwarfish model of the huge Northwestern engine which hauls their 17-car train from Chicago part way to Denver, Colorado. The engine was the Rock Island lines, and was #1142 (both name and number being vivid). The engine starts moving but as it nears one of the cross walks, the brakes are applied .... striking several men who are crossing the tracks. It now appears that Gladys is with me, and we decide to ask permission to ride in the engine as far as my hometown. We are told, however, that the engineer is a Frenchman who speaks no English, and for this reason we are denied permission. I debate whether or not to repeat our request.",Negative
"Bubba's Trailer Home  My friend Bubba Hacker and I each have a place to live. He has just turned 21. He shows me his new driver's license, and a temporary photograph, which is of his family. He had them taken in Lakeville, so I am assured I can get mine there. I think about leaving where I am. People leave Bubba's place, so I go over to see him. It seems that we each have trailer homes to live in. We look at photographs. Some of the photographs are of my cousin Melvin Redding at a beach with a watermelon. Others are of my friend Kevin Simpson and I fishing. There are some photographs of me with a big northern pike. In one, the fish is flipping around, flopping. In it, I have blood squirting from my finger because it has been cut off or cut. I had been at Bubba's place earlier, back when the people left. There are two little boys outside: they are five and six years old, respectively.",Negative
"I go over to a man's house. I am very interested in this man. He comes over to me and says, ""Hey, nice to see you, but I'm taking off with the guys. We're going hunting. If you're still here when I get back, we'll get together, OK?"" I have this internal feeling that yeah, I intend to be here. I'm going to stick it out as long as it takes. I also realize he's teasing me a bit, knowing I want to be with him and just selfishly taking off. He's rubbing my face in it a bit. I hang out. Later he returns and I am sitting on a couch and he sits next to me. I am aware that he is crazy, and I know I'm being accepted into the ""inner sanctum"" of his intimates. The phone rings. I answer it and it's for me. Some woman asks for Jiving Joe, and asks me how ""the Ladies"" went. She meant my Play, ""Ladies mayhemming society"" and how the rehearsals went, or the performance, I'm not sure which. She's an intimate friend of the man's and is semi-teasing me as well. Now I am leaving, maybe I'm a half-grown boy. The man is crazy and potentially dangerous. He sends a horse after me, to hurt me. I run and hide in a small room and the lock on the door is broken. I try and try to get it to lock. It won't. It's too late to go out and find another place to hide. So I see a smaller room, a closet and get into it. It has a working lock. I notice behind me a smaller enclosure, maybe a utility box that I could squeeze into if I have to. I choose not to for the moment.",Negative
"I was at a party down at White's. We were in the buildings. We looked out the window and there was a commotion. A policeman was outside with George Gedeons' wife. She was complaining that George was neglecting his family, especially the small baby. Then I went outside and Bill Grove was walking down the street imitating different people and a lady with him did the repeat of his. I had a mug of water hanging by a string. Bill Grove spit into my mug. It seemed that the whole country was at a standstill in industry. There were only a few special aluminum jobs being done. Andy P. and a couple other guys were doing the special job. There were crowds of people assembled by White's Sewing Machine Company.",Negative

"I dream about returning to my martial arts class after months of absence. The instructor has grown much older and fatter - he looks unfit and grumpy. When he sees me lined up with everyone else, he walks past and says sarcastically ""So you've returned. Try to keep up"". He then sets us a very difficult session. It is impossible for me to keep up. Another student puts on a frighteningly slick and fast display in front of the rest of the class - arms and legs moving like a kung fu machine. I notice we are in a much bigger training hall that usual. It looks like an old empty warehouse - rundown and spacious - the kind of place you see in gangster films. The instructor is giving me some very aggressive body language.",Negative

I remember thinking, ""WHY DOESN'T SHE TELL US ABOUT THESE THINGS BEFOREHAND!"" IÕm searching for my problems, and a pen and everything and I couldn't even find everything. Then, I remember her giving me a paper that said pretty much, ""I'm very disappointed in you, I don't even know why you're here."" There was something else in this dream sequence, something a little more positive (maybe it wasn't, but that's my waking impression).I don't really remember that part. I just remember it was a trip somewhere with some girl who's identity I'm unsure of. I don't remember why, with whom, or anything about it.",Negative

She had a couple of ______ things and I was trying to figure how she worked and what she did. And I was sitting here experimenting, and all of a sudden Dad comes in the room, and I put the doll's clothes on top of the doll, and I put a picture of a wreath on top of the thing, and then he starts talking to me and I kind of drift away to another scene. Before I know it, I'm contemplating going to the bathroom in a chicken dish.

"I was at home and it was almost dawn and I couldn't sleep. I went up to the roof to observe and the view was like thousands of houses lit up with lamps and all along the sea coast; it was a beautiful sight. Then I looked over to the roof of my neighbor's house (it must be noted that the scene wasn't what it is in reality) and I saw a little creature, a little boy, hanging by the ropes where the laundry is put out to dry. It seemed strange to me due to the lateness of the hour. I didn't know the boy. I went over to him and tried to carry him and get him off the rope, and he laughed. He must have been about two years old. Then the sky turned light and two nurses came and they told me he was the son of my neighbor (they took care of the child). I was stunned because I know all her children and I had never seen this boy. They took him down and I went to my bed. My mother had gone to the neighbor's house when suddenly I heard a noise and I ran to the neighbor's house and I heard my neighbor screaming that the child had broken his head. There was a great deal of confusion; people were running and screaming. My mother came out too. A while later they told me that the child had died as a consequence of the accident. They told me they had already buried him and I saw the whole family come out on the street wearing blue sweaters. My mother was looking through the window and telling me that the little boy had loved her very much and that she had loved him too, because he was very good.",Negative

"I had asked my family to all draw pictures of the Simpsons. I drew 5 pages on typing paper. I'd shuffled back and forth and worked so long on them the paper was dog-eared and wouldn't stack even. Rudy did a few pages of the Simpsons too. Aunt Linda drew a bunch of cartoons of the state of Nevada on legs. There was a parade. I was wanting to go because they threw out free stuff--toys and snacks. But nobody could get it together to leave. I saw the floats pass through the window. Santa Claus had already left. This was a home for wayward teenage mothers. A woman photographer had intended to shoot photos for ads of the girls being loving, wonderful mothers--but the girl holding a baby awkwardly and despisingly at arms length--facing away from her. The photographer used this picture. I had left the window open and kitty climbed out on a tiled roof. I was afraid to call her for fear she'd lose balance and fall. I tapped the window lightly. She came back in effortlessly. A guy told me branches fall on the roof all the time and it was not good I let her out. There were a bunch of cameras. I needed to get the right one--my Minolta. When I came back it was gone. I asked the house mother and she said look around. It was the last day of the ??? Girls they'd given up on were being sent home for good.

"I've been at a large glamorous motel, it's night, the place is all lit up and glittery, festive. [Something dramatic happens, and I end up leaving the scene in a hurry in a van with somebody else, being driven by a young boy.] We seem to be driving away from the motel, but it's much bigger than I thought, and the buildings keep on looking alike as we drive through. We've already turned right twice. The buildings are less glamorous now, but you'd suppose they would be. We make another right turn, and come into another neighborhood, and drive along a fence which is down an alley; or at least the fence is between two blocks of houses back-to-back; it doesn't seem like an alley, really. We come to where the fence stops, and get out. For some reason we're reluctant to go to the other side of the fence, because we're not sure what's there. So we walk around rather than take the van. On the other side it's daylight. It looks just like the side we were on, houses and all just the way it should be, but it's daylight instead of night. (Actually it's not pitch dark anyway - you might think of it as more dawn, you can see a bit - but not dusk, it's definitely been night.) We look back again to see, and by George it's still night over there, and day here. There's something suspicious about this and uncomfortable, like this daylight is not the way it's supposed to be, and we're going to get into big trouble if we stay here.",Negative

There, I made plans for us to get picked up. When I went to get out of bed (that's where I was emailing from, I guess), I discovered that I was naked.

I realized that I needed to tell her it was me that called Jonathan. I didn't want her to think less of me or be mad at me, so I was trying to figure out what to tell her about why I had called and why I had asked for that information.

"I dreamed that a man continually would come to my dormitory, ring the doorbell and while he waited at the door, I would hide in the living room behind a chair until I would see him leave. I seemed to be aware of the fact that I was terribly afraid of him, although I had never seen him before and he didn't look like anyone I had ever seen or known. I believe that a story had been going around the dorm (in the dream) that man would come around to all the dorms and attack the girls. I woke up after the dream (6:30) and was very much afraid. My heart was beating very quickly.",Negative

"I was being watched by a boy of about 10 who was really obnoxious.  I don't remember what he did to make me mad, but we kept verbally sparring.  I told him he was very rude to talk to older people the way he did.  When he finally said ""Fuck you,"" I really got mad and got up and roughed him up a little and pushed him out of the area where I was working.  I think I said something like, ""You don't have any religion, and you are going to go to hell,"" and he started crying.  He became much smaller then, and I almost felt sorry for him.  He was going to go home and tell his father, and I was afraid I would get in trouble.",Negative

While I was there, my mom called to tell me what my scores (for the SSAT's, for high school entrance) were. When I woke up from my dream, I asked my mom if I could see my test scores. She asked me how I knew that she had them - they had just come in the mail that day. Setting: My house and a friend's house. Characters: My parents were in the dream, and so was a friend of mine, but I'm not sure who it was. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I thought that it was strange because of the whole SSAT thing. It was like a psychic thing.",Positive
"I am walking in the ocean along the beach about thigh deep. At least I tell myself I am thigh deep, but I don't actually see the water on my legs. I see a wall of water on my left about that height. I am picking up tomato like plants and pulling them out of the ground by their tops which look like carrot tops. I then bury them into the sand again and they transform into eggs which quickly change into hard boiled. Then a sort of human being grows up rapidly out of that. It's kind of fun to watch, but then I get concerned that these new life forms will be abandoned and will die. It's not a good thing to do this for fun and then not be there to help the new creatures.",Negative
"(12/20/99)[""Moving.""] I am moving out of an apartment and have all my things out now. I had a friend like Anastasia's friends take my TV to California with them and bring it back. This out of the way route seemed to be the most convenient way to get it to my new place. Now I am walking down the city street, like MM City, but not. I am getting tired, walking. The way seems much longer than I thought. I realize I haven't yet given notice to the manager and will probably have to pay extra fees. That's OK. I wanted to move. I then come to a city intersection. I see a runaway truck out of control and it is headed toward me. I turn and try to run back down the alley I was walking in. I narrowly escape being hit. Now the truck needs to back up down the alley I am in. I walk as fast as I can and the way is difficult because now there are ditches with loose boards in them and I step carefully in this precarious area. At one point I look back and the truck is backing up really close and I call out. Stop. I'm here. The truck driver sees me and slows up a bit, but I am still forced to move faster than I can safely travel.",Negative

Then we rested on the other side of the coke ovens and got the signal the fallout was over. Then we came back and there were young men who were going to attack the invaders. Ann had about 6 dresses to sell. We passed a house about 500 ft. away from it and I'm not sure if we waved and the girls waved back at us. We signaled or yelled to them if they needed any dresses.

And so I finally got the thing stopped, but now after having, I dreamt that my house was next door to this one, and my mother was yelling at me. And I was rather perturbed over the fact that she was yelling at me; I didn't like that at all. So I said something to the effect that of all the things that I had to do that day, listening to her particular problems wasn't one of the things that I wanted to do. She kept on yelling.

"I was conducting a silent auction for SPX. I had donated two pieces of furniture and three of the figures from my outdoor nativity scene. The auction was almost over and I realized none of my items had sold. I felt a bit bad about that, thinking that I should have found better things to donate. Later, as we were cleaning up after the auction, I saw that my two pieces of furniture were gone. Someone had bought them after all. Someone came up and asked me what had not sold and I pointed out the few items that were left, which included my three nativity figures. Someone who had been helping with the auction had collected all of the money and had it in a zippered vinyl bank bag. When I found her and asked for it, it appeared from the look on her face that she had not intended to give it to me. I took it, with the other things I had, and went to find an empty office within the parish offices where I could sit down and go over everything, and figure out what our total revenue was from the auction. I looked into several of the offices but wasn't sure which ones were okay for me to us. Judy A was in one of the offices where there were three desks. There were many boxes and other things sitting all over the place. She indicated one of the desks in that room that I could use, saying that someone was coming in to use the other one.

Matthew had gotten a dog for Ashley B. It looked just like Belle. Not full grown but maybe just a few months old. Not a puppy either. Ashley B had just had a baby.

There were also seeking permission from the city or something to cut a tree down outside the house for some reason because of the dog. I was upset because I didn't want the tree cut down.

"It was a regular afternoon and I was visiting in the home of my friends L. and N., who are adolescent sisters and each one is jealous of the other one's friends.

Her father, who is rude but affectionate, was there and so was her mother, who is cold, distant and calculating, but who surprised us this morning with her agreeableness.

Then N. told me that she had to take a bath and had to go out for some reason, and there wasn't any water in her house.

"I looked from a car window into a land which, it seems to me, I have visited before when asleep, though never when awake. There were no trees. Jagged cliffs of gray limestone rose out of smooth and rolling fields covered with short, fine grass--mostly beautifully green and as free from weeds and stones as any lawn. Above the ledges the ground was again grassy and thrown into swells and hollows of most graceful contour. Then more cliffs sprang to another level and so on, terrace above terrace. Here and there smart white buildings stood out in the powerful sunshine. ""Peterboro Mountain,"" I announced confidently as I viewed my creation. Wandering over the green slopes, I approached a towering mass of rocks in which was an opening--a great funnel slanting down with a small glimmer of light at the end. Evidently it extended through to the other side of this rugged spur. I went in. Presently the passage tapered until I crawled, rubbing the rock and descending gradually. At length I could squeeze no further. A yard or two ahead I could see that the light which had guided me streamed into the cave from an invisible source--probably an opening--around a corner at the left. Suddenly I felt oppressed and dizzy. I climbed a rough ledge above a large and beautiful spring. There were pebbles of pink and slate color at the bottom of the clear pool. Mr. U. seemed to be up above among the bushes. I was on top of Mr. H.'s room, sitting close to the edge and dissecting some large moths, which I killed by rolling them in paper saturated in picric acid.",Negative

"Johnnie Matuck and Peter were put into a glass-sided patrol wagon because Pete got porky. When the cop wasn't looking, he made a run for home and got away. The policeman ran the wrong way. I walked out of the union supply store in Rivertown and sat on a step and found out I was in the large display window. There was a nice girl playing with my toes. And a fellow was barefooted and he put his toes against me and wiggled them. I saw he looked like he had athlete's foot, so I pulled my foot away from him.",Negative

"I saw gloss color picked to win. I saw leader as winner. I saw a newspaper and the headline started Admit one Cent and I awoke. Ann and I were driving down a road. We came to a road. It was so steep. I put my brake on and I held onto the sides and let the car down slow. When we came down, I looked up and a girl was coming down in her car slowly. It was about 95 degrees steep. I saw Uncle Jake with his high power rifle in Shinnae hunting ground hogs. When he walked by, I saw a fox stick his head out of a hole and then come out. Rubber was flooded over the land and we were shoveling, digging it and hauling it back with wheelbarrows.",Negative

"An unusual dream experience to record. Fell back asleep this morning after my wife had gotten up. Sleeping on my stomach, an unusual position for me. I don't recall many details of the experience, but it involved a diffuse awareness of the fact that I was dreaming, that it was not an ordinary dream because the visual imagery was not as clear and far more subject to my will than an ordinary dream. An awareness that I could gradually shift my awareness over to actual bodily sensations and thus more toward wakefulness if I wished, but I did not do so until late in the experience. Continuous awareness of a ""body"" that was mine but which I knew was not my physical body or, at best, only a very indirect representation of it. My attempts in this state (which was not full consciousness) were a feeling of floating upward. I knew I was lying on my stomach, that this was an unfavorable position for projection according to Muldoon, but I tried anyway. My efforts could considerably increase feelings of lightness, but not break me free from my body. This was largely the first part of the experience. During this part I was only aware of myself and attempts to break free -- by and large, there was no ""dream environment"" that I could recall. In the latter half of the experience, I got into a dream environment, nebulously perceived as a rather featureless room. There was a female figure and a large, powerful male figure, both of which were relatively nebulous, as was the environment. I was aware of this thin quality of the characters and environment, and ""semi-consciously"" realized that this was all a symbolic environment of my creation, and that I would accept it for that and try to use it to have a projection. Thus I treated the male figure as a father figure and myself (also in a nebulous body) as a child playing with him, such that he would throw me upward. This produced appropriate ""somatic"" sensations of sailing up, but I considered them only symbolic, and dreamish, as there was not the sudden clearing of sight and vision of the real world that I expected to come with a genuine projection. There were sounds of some sort here, but I don't recall them, except to feel fairly certain they were not real world sounds coming through. After a while I tired of this latter sequence, feeling it just wasn't getting anywhere, so semi-volitionally I shifted my attention to real sensations of body in a gradual way until I was fully awake.",Negative

"I dreamed that a bunch of kids from college went sledding on a real cold nite. It was about 10 below zero, but we were all dressed real warm (we thought). We went down on this great big sled and we kept on going and going and going. I tried to stop the sled, but couldn't. It seemed as if we were going for miles and miles. We finally stopped and we tried to get up off of the sled, but we were frozen right to it. I woke up then and was very cold, especially my feet and hands.",Negative
"There was this girl with long brown hair. She was pretty. She was dressed in these green sweatclothes. She was being a bitch because she was making fun of me and my friends and laughing at the same time. She had two friends with her. Finally I got tired of it, and I pulled out a strip of metal, a thick metal bar. I hit her with it gently but firmly three times on her sides, legs. Then I suddenly hit her on the back of the neck. It went halfway through and I pulled it out. There was no blood, just a dark line where it went in. Everybody but myself ran away from her. Then I woke up.",Negative
"Going to Grandma's, just over the bridge at Rocky River on Mitchell Presley's hill there was a rabid dog on the hill. He had gnawed up a carcass but you could see the left side of the hind legs. It was either a wolf or a cow. We locked the car doors. At our house on Maplebrook we'd never once had Doritos, but we had them. A big family bag. My mother said, ""If you eat those things you won't eat your supper,"" but she was eating them. ""They always make you thirsty,"" she said. And I got some water, because we never had cokes at home. ""I worked so hard on supper and now nobody's gonna eat their supper,"" she said, ""I boiled 2 eggs for supper but there's only one and a half left. A half is in the kitchen and a whole egg is left over from Easter. It's in that basket on the piano."" But we were trying to concentrate on reading the newspaper. It had funny headlines. It had a picture of a local high school Christian group and the headline said, ""GOD IS MOD"". It had a picture of Coach O'Rear. And then on the other side of the newspaper it had a high school drawing that was so bad it was good. On the wedding page it had a drawing of a guy's girlfriend and he'd scrawled out in black crayon, ""Look at those tits."" I was at a swimming pool and Dora was there. There was a swimming race. Dora was so calm. She said, ""There's no need to race."" Everybody was talking about whether swimming with a wet suit would make you faster, or the color of the wet suit that would make you swim faster. That film changing bag when you put your film in the canister, when the lights aren't out in the darkroom, or when you can't have the red light on in the darkroom, or even the amber light? I was carrying that around waiting to go to the ladies' bathroom at church and Merri Lindley told me to hold her two pencils. ""Hold these two pencils and don't get them dirty,"" she said. I had enough to keep track of without having to worry about those two pencils. I put them in the film changing bag and all the time I was worried that they were going to poke a hole in it. When I got off the train at West 4 St station, the 8th St exit, on Greenwich St. was a new ""Gay/Bi"" Coffee shop. The sign was pink and brown and they didn't finish painting it. Profiles were painted on it sort of mod. I'd wanted some coffee all day. Their coffee had some kind of cocoa or chocolate flavor but I'd never tasted it before. I drank it through a straw. There were 9 employees but no customers. 2 guys and 1 girl X 3. It was getting dark and Ester said, ""Merri, I just happened to be in the neighborhood."" ""What are you doing Ester?"" I asked. ""I'm editing a film about a rap star. His name is Sammy Junior Daby."" ""You mean Sammy Davis Junior?"" ""No, It's Sammy Junior Daby."" ""Oh"" I said ""You wanna take a walk?""Evelyn asked me.

"It was the middle of the night and a helicopter landed on Cassandra's house. I think that I felt like the reason why they did is because they had some kind of emergency and they couldn't go any further, so then like emergency landed on Cassandra's house. Then a plane emergency landed on our house, because the plane had to rescue whoever was in the helicopter. [laugh] And it was kind of funny because we all thought it was going to be bad and, you know, when the plane landed on our house, it kind of knocked a few boards loose, but it didn't really flatten the house like sometimes we say it will. I'm trying to think. And it was a general scene where all of us were up kind of late, it was past 11:00 or 12:00 at night, and I think it was like one other person, it was one of the first nights Mom and Dad were back in town. And I think Dad was talking on the phone and Mom was doing something like shuffling papers on the dining room table. And I was up late, I was watching something on TV. And then I don't remember what happened ______ but next thing I knew it was Halloween and I didn't have like the stuff set up like I usually do. Oh, I know, part of this was when we were up late, I was on the porch, and it was another one of those dreams where we listened to the boom box and I couldn't shut it off when I realized that Mom & Dad were home. And I couldn't even take the batteries out. It was the funniest thing. And so I turned it all the way down and it still could be heard. And then the next thing I knew, it was Halloween and I didn't have my stuff set out like I usually do. And I was upstairs digging some more stuff out, and next thing I knew, the doorbell rang, and it was people {trick-or-treaters} and you know how you give each people two things of candy in their bag _______________, well this kid said, ""No, I want a big one like my brother; I want a blue one."" And I said, ""Okay, I don't think I have one, but you can look."" And he looked and looked, ""No, you don't have one."" And so I said, ""Well, have a good _____,"" and he left.

"It was just before a stunt night rehearsal. I had to find a gym outfit to wear and went to the gym department. At the desk I noticed racks of costumes which the seniors wore two years ago. They were striped black and yellow with purses to match. Also on the shelf were a number of glasses--cocktail or champagne glasses. Finally the teacher came to the desk. It was one of the Mather instructors but, looking around, I realized it was the gym department of the high school I attended in New York. I then went into my gym class and participated in the activities. From there, went down to the locker room and still being confused as to whether I was in Cleveland or New York, I couldn't find my locker. I seemed to have been in a very big hurry.

"I was swimming in a pool that I had frequented this summer. There were a great many girls swimming too and when I looked at them I noticed they didn't have any bathing suits on. I went underneath the water and one of the girls followed me and there was a bed on the bottom of the pool. After I had satisfied myself with one girl another came down to the bottom of the pool. This went on for a long time until I could no longer stay underneath the water. I started to dry myself after leaving the water and all the girls gathered around and blew hot air on me until I was dry.

"I and another member of my family (either my father or my mother) were sitting huddled on the stairs. Someone was sitting on the landing above, fishing, and we kept trying to keep out of reach of the hooks. I imagine we could have gotten away but somehow we had to stay. In another fragment of the dream I was driving a truck and two of my school friends were with me. We went from store to store buying books. I could see myself shifting gears & even said in the dream, ""Now put her in second, now third,"" etc. Interpretation I have no interpretation, but I do wonder about driving. This is the third dream I have had in which I have been driving and shifting gears has been such an important part of the dream. Perhaps this is because I want to learn to drive & the only thing I can do now is shift gears, but I don't think I want to drive that badly. Perhaps there is some other explanation.

"A lot of it was very unusual. It seemed that for most of the dream things were in a constant state of metamorphosis. I was aware of this in the dream though I had no thoughts about it being a dream or about being lucid. I was walking inside a building. The walls just ahead of me to my left continued to change as I walked forward. I know I had some kind of thought about how this would impact where I was headed as I was walking but that's all I can remember. There were a lot of very unusual images. There were two men in this dream that were executives for a company. The name of one of them was Tom Mossman. The other one I only know his last name and it was Merriman. Their company was going to be donating products for something that I was involved in. I don't know that I ever actually saw or met Mr. Merriman. I saw Tom a few times. One of those times he expressed an interest in going out with me. I don't think I gave him an answer and I think there were probably a couple of reasons why I didn't. The main one is it didn't seem appropriate given our professional relationship. I think part of it was also because I don't know what I want right now in terms of relationship with a man and I didn't know if he would want to go out if it was always just going to be casual dating. I went to their facility to look at the things that they were going to donate. They had large quantities of each item and they were all sitting in a large room. It didn't really look like a factory or a warehouse or anything like that. The things were all set up in rows with aisles between them. I was walking up and down the aisles looking at the various things. At first I was concerned because the items looked very worn, for lack of a better word. Some of the colors on some of them were faded or chipped. It looked like they were used. I didn't feel it was appropriate to give away items that look like this at the event I was involved in. It seems to me that there were two employees in this room as I was walking around and that may be someone involved in what I was working on had joined me while I was there. Someone reassured me that the items that we would be getting were all in very good condition and looked fine. They pointed to some items in the room as an example and so I felt a little less concerned. Tom approached me again. He was being very charming. He said something to me about once our transaction was over we wouldn't be in a business relationship anymore so then we could go out. He also said something to imply that he was quite confident that he would change my mind and get me to go out with him.",Negative

"I was organizing things, and putting them in order. I was working in the office of a retail business.

One part of the office reminds me of the backroom of NTNS except it was much longer and the ceiling was much higher. We have lost something and there are several of us looking for it. We're looking in an area that looks like the backroom. It seems to be about the same size and shape of a flipchart but I know that's not what it is. It does have something to do with information though. Susan J is working in the backroom of NTNS. She is very cheery. There have been some changes and she is telling me how much more comfortable she is working there now. There are two male employees and one male member of the top management team get into an elevator. I reached out and stopped the doors from closing so I could get in as well.

Suddenly, we see we are on a lunch bus and it is beginning to move on it's route. We are startled. ""Maybe we should get off"" she says. I say get the name of the street. I hope we can find the van. We sit there in indecision. I try and see street corner signs.",Negative
"Last night I was in Birmingham, England. Walking through the streets with another fellow, I came to a shabby brick building and said to myself, ""This is the Town Hall."" We went in and found ourselves in a large, bare room with an unpainted counter at one end. We joined a motley company of some twenty people, each of whom placed an American dime on the counter. A man collected the fees and then brought in a small shepherd dog and a half grown pig. We expected to see them perform, but something interrupted. I hunted up Dr. H. and asked him what the show man would have done with his pets. But he could not throw much light on the question.",Negative
"I had lunch in the mall with my CRHP sisters and Sue P. Sue P said Vince P hasn't been well and hasn't been around much, maybe not in town much. I wondered if this is why he has not returned my calls lately. Sue P had black and yellow hair braids attached to her hair. We all sat at round tables with 3-4 people per table. We were at Keystone at the Crossing Mall. When I left the mall I couldn't find my car. It was near Christmas time. There was snow on the ground and it was very cold. I went into another restaurant, which you could enter from the parking lot, to warm up. Bill C. was there alone, sitting in a booth. I joined him and he told me he was waiting on another couple that he was going to be dining with. We chatted until they arrived. They all invited me to stay and then Bill C could drive me around to find my car. When we got ready to go he needed to use the restroom. He went down this long hall and was waiting for someone to come out. He was wearing a long beige sweater, similar to one I own. His had large patches of brown leather on it. We were driving around looking for my car. We were talking about Christmas and that he still needed to do some Christmas shopping with just a few days left. I recall talking about his family and some other things. He told me that I needed to lose weight. I could tell there was some chemistry between us. I don't recall if we found my car or not. Before I got out of his car he leaned over and kissed me.",Positive
"Pedro and Kevin and I are frolicking around. Kevin has to pee: he goes to a nearby tree, holds up a newspaper, so that I cannot see his genitals and starts to pee in a big arc for a long long time, until his naked feet are standing in about 2"" of pee water!!!",Positive
"We were in a house, I don't know whose it was, my sister was getting some ice-cream together and strawberries, but instead of putting them together we had them separately. There were strawberries in a dish and instead of using a spoon, I had picked up the dish and was drinking the strawberries out of the dish and I was going to get to the ice cream later after the strawberries. I could feel the little bowls that they were in and just before I began to eat the strawberries, I put an object, it was a soft, stuffed animal type thing but it was a person, made of this canvasy type material representing Saint Paul. So somehow I had to put this thing, like a stuffed animal, next to me and someone said ""that's Saint John"" and I said ""No that's Saint Paul"" . It had a great big base so I knew it wasn't going to fall over or get into my ice cream or strawberries.",Positive
"3. Something about catching fish. John and Robert Kennedy are involved. So is Susan Spear, a former patient, but to whom I'm demonstrating effective work and honesty. When pulling up these large fish, something else would come along and start swallowing it up. There was some uneasiness less you get swallowed up yourself. One brief, very clear image of John Kennedy with whom I was either working or competing, with regard to the fishing, and of whom I was very proud. There was something about admiration for this fine lined ""English"" face.",Positive
"3 Dollar Australian Coin  I'm in the Big Resort Area with my friend Kevin Simpson. This area seems like Australia. We're on a lake next to Trout Lake. A couple is there and asks us how to get out of the lake. I say, ""The only way out is to portage. It's a hard portage but you'll like it."" We have a choice of buying coyote or Squirt pop. We are in a little bay. There is a river flowing in. There is a beautiful pond and a stream flowing in. A person can see their reflection in them. The water is very cold. Kevin and I walk in the stream. I have on my Nike cross-trainers. In the pond I see what I think is a school of eels. It turns out to be a school of suckers. I have been sucking on leeches. I spit them out of my mouth.  There is a nicely cut area of green lawn with cement sidewalk and buildings, like a courtyard. There are pop machines there. A person on roller blades goes by. There is a skateboard in the corner by the pop machine. A boy comes to get the skateboard: it is his. I find three pennies, a $2 coin, and a $3 coin. A psychology professor I know from Brimson named Kari Cutting comes to me dressed in black and on crutches, to ask for directions.",Negative
"Frank has bought us a new house, which used to be a Church and a gambling casino. It is huge and he entertains huge number of people in weird ways (e.g., sleigh rides, gourmet dishes, etc.). There are lots of telephone booths, lots of kids, old and young: I see Betty Ruth (a mother of one of my NS kids in 1950s). She asks me to send some $$ for charity to France; I see her redheaded, tiny baby; it laughs when I smile at it. It transforms into an old woman. -- Then I go downstairs and try to call from one of the many phone booths: then upstairs: to a magnificent modern room: furnished with all our own things: but I still don't see Frank; can't understand why Frank has rented such a huge, weird place; puzzled; awaken.",Positive
"Then I dreamt a different thing, very complicated. Instead of living in a house, we lived in an apartment (father, mother, sister -- 17, brother -- 13) and my father was already very old. He didn't look like my father, but I had the feeling I was the daughter of that man. Suddenly I saw myself sitting in the car with another person. I don't know who it was; I only remember I felt I was with somebody. But at the same time, I felt I was his daughter. I felt like a friend of that family because I was asking my father about everyone's health. He told us that his wife was in her room with arteriosclerosis and that he was taking care of her (my mother is a young and healthy person). Then he touched on the problem he had of a daughter who was very much in love with an indecent doctor and that she didn't know this and couldn't say no to him. He also loved her, but in a very peculiar way. I remember I saw both of them in a hospital. She was crying and scolding him, blaming her own weakness. Then I saw them going into the apartment and she had made up her mind not to see him any more. Everything was very confused because at the same time I identified myself with the friend in the car, with the daughter, such as I am, and with the daughter about whom the father was talking, but the things he told me were like things in a movie and she is physically different from me and older. After this I awoke.",Negative
I was at Nana's in a garden. I went behind this shed and there was stuff growing so I went to run but Poppa and Fido came and Poppa was then some shifty person and I called out something.

Dad and I went to go to this place to watch House but we missed it. There was a killer at this place and it was Tony (24). He killed someone then the alarm sounded and he left. Then I was the killer and some psychologist was talking to me in this house about when I killed the person and why.,Negative
"It was the beginning of a new semester at my alma mater, and I had moved into a dorm, on the side facing the quad.  The room seemed familiar to me (but I think I only lived on that side during my freshman year).  It was at night, and I was listening to the ""oldies hour"" on WPGX.  The room was a mess -- it needed to be swept and scrubbed -- and it occurred to me that my alma mater should have had that done before we came.  My roommate arrived, and it was Bob Neenan  I started asking him about his experiences in Vietnam.  He wasn't too articulate about it, and seemed to be weighing his words carefully.  I didn't press him on the issue, because I had heard that his feelings about the war had softened somewhat.",Positive
"I was walking along a new highway with some people and there were a lot of girls making fools of men. They sucked them in and then got a lot of money from them. I was in Rivertown my boyhood town. It was being built up. I said, ""I remember where I used to pasture cows, there were homes built now."" Ann said she was going to die and leave me. I was looking at Rivertown and I said what a beautiful town. It was full of trees just like a forest. I was working at White's. Joe Grabar let me look at one tool Bill Kotnik ground. I looked at it and commented how he ground it because it looked like no grind I saw before. I saw a town horse winner.",Negative

"Am with some woman who I apparently know and we are walking to someone's apartment. Arriving there, we pass thru the garden and I note with pleasure the many tall seedlings in boxes and think I may see if I can get some for my house. We climb stairs and a man approaches. I ask for the apartment of Mr. Weiss. He nods consent and opens the door of a nearby apartment. As we walk in, the woman with me giggles and I look at her with distaste. Her profile is strange and I realize she is a stranger. The man who opened door seems to be a janitor or attendant of some sort, but he goes behind a counter and brings out some stamps for sale. Says he will find a nice set of the series I am looking for. I wait and then note he is completely wrong and the 4 or 5 stamps he has placed on the counter are completely different from anything I want and I have a suspicion he knows nothing about the stamps. Meanwhile, 5 or 6 homemakers and their children are standing near doorway and I note they are rather good-looking in an interesting way, and I have a strong desire to walk over and talk with them instead of having to explain to the janitor how wrong he is about the stamps. I am sure he will not understand and a hassle will develop.",Positive
"I was playing this game and I was a spy/detective in it. The first thing you did was choose a husband and something else. I chose the first guy I saw, but he was really ugly and had blue eyes. The role of the guy was to take the kids to school? Everyone there was weird and had a 'handler'. There was a mini game with items and one of them was a cigarette and I took up smoking. They had a strange flavour and it felt weird and it was hard to breathe. I can't read my notes, but there's something about a robot which had another robot in it. The weight was like 94.5kg. There were Staffy's and toy plates? There were stupid places like a wall? I quit going to the Cat Haven and was annoyed that I wouldn't have a chance to develop anything with Preston (that's where I'd met him).",Negative
"I was in a room where someone was giving birth. It was a character from General Hospital. Carly was receiving a C-section. Two other characters from General Hospital, Alan Quartermane and Monica Quartermane, were giving Carly this operation. These two people happen to hate Carly, so as I watched, I thought it was odd they were doing the operation. Carly asked if her baby was all right and the two doctors said yes, but gave each other side-glances, like they were lying to her. They were planning to kidnap the baby. Then two African-American males were walking around the hospital arguing because they were lost. Whenever I saw these two, they were always walking away from me. They seemed out of place characters, like they were from another TV show and weren't supposed to be on the set of General Hospital. They were overacting the whole time they were in my dream. Then I was in the reception area of a hospital and the receptionist was called away. Then I saw someone tip over a container filled with tarantulas.",Negative

"I am getting into a group of women who are going into a bleachers area to sing group songs. I don't know what holiday it is, but this is a usual holiday thing to do. I and Andrea are trying to catch up with our group, but get lost and end up with a group of swimmers and divers. There is a swimming pool to the right, and in front of our bleachers is a pool used as the stage area. I watch a scene where a man and a woman get in a small rectangular rowboat and sing as we all sing the chorus. A wave or two comes up and splashes the woman and she mimes jumping up real quick so it doesn't get her all wet on her bottom. I and Aunt Bridget are sitting on the right side of the bleachers. It is very crowded. We sing along with the group but don't know the songs. I notice my voice is clear and pretty and I seem to be able to keep up with the words by listening carefully. I look over to the bleachers on my left and up and see a small group of people in green sort of fish costumes with green makeup on their faces. They are pretty and all the same. Now muffins and cookies and cakes are being served to the crowd and I can see they are moist and sweet and would taste really good, better than if we'd stayed with our own group. I look to my right and notice the water is all gone from the swim pool. There had been some girls taking lessons there. [BL]",Positive
I was in an apartment with some girl and we talked about black and white vs colour. The house was in black and white. She said movies in colour looked happier. She painted the floors yellow and bright. A guy came and was angry. We book stood up to him. Then he left and bad guys came. Alexander Skarsgard was there. I had coins in my pocket including some Swedish coins. He and the other guys came in. I tried to get past them and eventually managed to. I had to go down heaps of stairs and they chased me. I hid and then I was with someone else. They said 'assume that someone was looking for us there' so we went the other way but there were people in the bush. Wil Wheaton was one of them. Some other people saw us and we ran. We went into this building and there was a guy and girl with plastic suits on. Linus made a thread on FilmForum about all the movies he'd seen with stats. He'd seen The Big Chill 10 times.,Negative

"I was on my go-cart/bicycle/car. I will call it my car from here because that is what I was calling it in the dream. I was going to St. Joe. I picked up several of my relatives on the Harris side of the family. Allen was one of them but I don't remember who the others were. They got on behind me like they were one behind the other as if on a motorcycle. We were going for a drive but I don't remember where we were headed. I was going up a hill and I was having difficulty getting up the hill. Uncle H used his feet to help us get up this hill. I am sitting in Doctor Da' office. Mother and Daddy were there with me. I had an 8 am appointment. Doctor Da is a dentist. We sat there. We kept waiting and waiting all day long until almost 4 pm. I finally asked while we were still waiting and he said that he didn't show that we had an appointment. I said I had just made the appointment two months ago and that I had made it for first thing in the morning so the rest of the day I could have free. I was upset because I had now lost the whole day. He didn't even apologize. He just said that I didn't have an appointment and it wasn't in his books. He didn't have anything computerized. He just had a paper appointment book. I thought it might be the receptionist fault. that perhaps she didn't write it down in the book when we spoke. He asked me if I had a specific problem and I said that I did. I've had this tooth that I lost a filling and it's been bothering me for a long time. He said I could schedule another appointment. When I scheduled the last time the soonest I could get in was two months later and now I was going to have to wait another two months. I was very upset because Mother and Daddy thought that I had screwed up. They thought that maybe I had written it down wrong. Then there was some discussion about my taking the relatives for a ride in my car and how inappropriate that was. Matthew was with us and so was Bill F. Someone from Doctor Da' office had borrowed some audio books or videos. First it was just one and she brought it out and gave it back to me, but later she came back with 3 or 4 more. I noticed that they were all still in their cellophane wrappers which meant they had not even watched them or listened to them. They were still brand new. I finally decided to go ahead and leave. I had some other things too. Bill F was driving a pick-up truck so I put my things in the back of the truck and told Bill F to go ahead and take Matthew back and I would just go ahead and drive my car back MYSELF.

"I remember whipping around some sea cucumber in an aquarium, but how that relates to anything else, I have no idea.  There was some sort of...gizmo? I guess it was a government project or something, because it was supposed to be off-limits. I think I was with one or two other people who went in and got it. Took us a little bit to figure out how to work it. It essentially looked like a 3-foot fan, with the protective housing around it. By holding onto it, we could sort of fly around.  We ended up somewhere, I guess with choir. I was going to demonstrate how to use the thing, explaining how it could make you fly. Something about lettuce wings. I guess I went to demonstrate, and something gave it away that I was the one flying, the gizmo had nothing to do with it. My choir instructor Jack said, ""I knew it!"" One girl was especially eager and I guess jealous, but wasn't aware that I was the one flying. She wanted to try the gizmo so climbed out on a tower roof- this was about the same time as I began my demonstration and right when it was becoming apparent it was me in control of levitating, not the machine. She fell and died. I felt it was my fault because even though I didn't know it was me, not the machine, I felt that subconsciously I must have known and so put the girl at risk, even though nobody else seemed to blame me.",Negative

But there was a guy with my mother, and according to some strange test she'd taken, the results showed that we were his kids.  This didn't seem all that strange to me- I just figured that in an alternate reality he was her younger brother so the DNA would be similar.",Negative

And I think before I woke up, we were finally on that flight, but we weren't really going to get into town until 7:30 at night, which really we're getting there at like 6:00, or no, we're getting there at 4:45, but we probably won't get to Aunt Christine's house until 6:00. But in my dream we wouldn't even land until 7:30, and I was thinking, ""Oh, my gosh, what a terrible chain of domino effects this was -- diddle doddle, diddle doddle, and we didn't get out until late. Oh, my gosh."" And that's really all there is to it. Although this dream has its literal implications about us getting on a plane and all, I think this dream referred more to life and what I feel I'm missing out on. I guess I just feel like now my dependence will never disappear, and what I could miss out on and that I might finally get to my destination, but it might be much later in life than I had hoped. So that's that.",Negative
"It's my birthday. I get up and go to the living room, where there is a bed. On the bed is a guru person seated on a pillow. I say, ""I dreamt you were here and now you are! How amazing."" I am joined by a group of my women friends and a box of chocolate candies. It's not exactly the same candies as in the dream, but close enough. Then I get up. Howard has come in. He wants us to stay together. I want to get a divorce and go live alone in a cabin in the woods. He is sad, but agrees. We discuss who will keep the children. I want to keep them this time, but am torn, because it would be so hard, so much energy.",Negative
"When I dreamed this, I was only half-asleep. I was in a classroom, but I didn't know any of the other students; they all wore uniforms. The professor was a priest, so I think it must have been theology, but I had never seen him before. The teacher called me and told me that I had thrown a pen he had given me in the waste can and later he told me to go and pick it up again. I don't understand this dream.",Positive
"Blake stands facing me. There are paper clips and lights on strings between us. As Blake moves, a force pushes the metal things. I must run. I get into a black race car and drive rapidly away. I am running from Blake. He's following. I'm on a freeway that spirals and turns this way and that. I keep choosing roads that curve to the left because that takes me away from Blake. I get out into the country and find a special retreat of mine, a friend's house. I drive my car in and hide the car in a basement hall. I run up stairs to check the doors to see that they are locked. Safety pins are the locks. The house appears deserted. Old fashioned furniture, very few pieces and old lace curtains. Fallen leaves are all over the yard. I go back downstairs and check the doors and windows. A black out curtain is over the windows. I feel Blake outside. I sit very quietly. 2 other young women are there. One makes some noise that draws Blake's attention. I try to stop her. I explain that he's dangerous.",Negative
"Ride To Florida On Highway 2  I'm at the Oak Valley Bank. I go out the south door, picking up a jar a salsa and a man who needs a ride. We get into my truck. He needs a ride to Florida, he says, and that we should get on Highway 2. I go west at first, thinking I'm going east, but knowing I'm going in the wrong direction. Then I go east, and it seems right. We are back at the Whitman house. My roommate Stephen Ramos' car, a light blue Monte Carlo, is parked on the side of the road, and is dented and smashed up. Another car with its engine missing is there. The engine has been stripped and stolen. The man has an old school bus parked there. I tell he should get the title and sell it to me for 10 or 20 bucks and I'll junk it for him. He wants a car to drive, and is thinking about taking the engine out of Stephen's car and fixing up the body of the other car, and combining the two. That would be a big project: a lot of work.",Positive
"I have again dreamt that I was in Cuzco. I dream this often. I always see myself in beautiful landscapes, alone, contemplating the river. But after that I see myself surrounded by many people in a dancehall, where I am the most wanted dance partner. But then, I don't know how, I find myself praying in the garden. Afterwards I see myself in Lima, but just as though I were in Cuzco. The places become interchangeable. I always dream of a person whom I loved very much. This person happens to live in Cuzco, and I think that this is why when I dream of that landscape, I always feel a lump in my throat and watery eyes. I am on the highway, which, in the dream, has a wall with an entrance to the city, but I am unable to enter it. In reality there is no such wall in Cuzco. Afterwards I see that I am bathing naked in the river. There isn't anyone around, but nevertheless, I feel ashamed. Then I don't remember any more.",Negative
"I was at this class with Ophelia in college, and it was more of a linguistics class than a Spanish class because we were given these sheets with pictures and _____ with _________s. And they had pictures and they had sentences that, oh my gosh, were comprised of Spanish words and Italian words and German words and French words all mixed around. There was even some Latin thrown in. And we had to discern the meaning of the sentence based on the familiarity with the Latin bases in each language and look at the picture. Oh yeah, and there were some blanks in the sentence too. And we had to fill in the blanks with Spanish words because that was the only foreign language that we had expressive and receptive skills in. And then we had to write our own sentences, and I don't remember being able to discern too well what the pre-made sentences were. But then I wrote, we wrote some of our own sentences, and one of the sentences was, ""Dwight and his girlfriend had keys to the bathroom because they had to go really bad. Then they got locked in."" [laugh] Now where that came from, I don't know, but I remember I was working on another one of those, and we were at the airport. Mom and I were supposed to go on a plane somewhere, I think, and I was working until like the last minute to finish that thing. You know how I do sometimes. And then I had to, I really did have to go to the bathroom, and, well, come to think of it, I wasn't going anywhere with Mom; I was going with this class. And I had to go to the bathroom, and in this line of bathroom stalls, they had stalls with doors that closed, and they had empty toilets facing sideways in front of the doors. And so I sat on one of the empty toilets in front of the doors, and the door was open, and Dad said, ""Try and move over in here; I've got to go too."" And he went in the stall and closed the door, and here I am sitting on the toilet in front of the door. I guess he Athought it was more politically correct to see a woman going to the bathroom than to see a man going. And as I'm trying to go, somebody in the airport comes out and starts talking to this class about what they're going to do when and what flight they're going to take and what city they're going to stop in and giving them directions. And I noticed that they were all sitting real close to me, and I'm like in the audience. I'm just on a toilet instead. And so I'm standing up and trying to pull up my pants and I feel a little embarrassed. And then I woke up.",Negative
"I dreamed that I went with a boy whom I liked very much to look for an engagement ring. We went into a jewelry store and I chose the ring. It was a very small diamond surrounded by glass. It was very large as the glass made it appear large. I liked the ring - but when my family and friends saw it, they thought it was very ugly. I felt disturbed about the ring after I showed it to everyone and I grew to dislike it then. Interpretation The only interpretation that I can offer is that I have thought many times of marrying this boy of whom I dreamt about. There is no mention of marriage, or engagements when we go out together. I am just another ""date"" to him. Where as I like him more than any other fella I date. Answers to questions 2.

We told him he'd have to ask Miss W. for it. Looking over my clothes, I found a panty girdle I had forgotten I had. We went to the dining room. I caught on another resident's green net dress. It didn't seem to be torn but I told her of how torn my green lace had been before it was noticeable. Then I put some things in a chest but left out one article. Asked why, I said it was not mine.

"I go back twice to the Lumber Yard Company in my hometown to get 2 paper pads, and $4.80 in money which had been left there for safe keeping. The ground is dry and thick with dust; the dust is 2 or 3 inches deep directly in front of the office door and I unavoidably track some in. On my first onset, the only person in the office or yard is a small, rather old, more of less wizened man, who apparently is unable to do anything for me. On my second visit, this man calls to Mr. Myers in the yard, and the latter walks toward the office, but instead of entering by the door I used, he pulls some keys from his pocket, unlocks a small door leading into the office proper, and enters that way. Mr. Myers asks the man who it is and the latter says someone has come for a package and Mr. Myers then unlocks the door of a sort of cabinet and pulls out several shallow drawers. He finds my pads, one of which has ""$4.80"" written on first page. I ask him if Harold and Horace are in town, and he says, ""Yes, they are,"" in a perfectly calm tone. This surprises me, as I feel sure he has taken my money, and I expect him to show some sign of guilt. He goes on to explain about a check which was no good because drawn on an insolvent bank. I am having considerable difficulty in hearing, and curve my hand around one ear. Myers is smooth shaven and younger looking than when I knew him. He takes a drink from a water fountain. In spite of my suspicion that he has taken my money, I am very apologetic about the possible trouble or worry he has been to in caring for my property. He then says something to the effect that feeling as I do, I won't mind the loss of the money. I try to look at matter philosophically, thinking I had intended some of the money for Harold and Horace in the first place.",Negative

"It had snowed last night, and the maintenance guys had come and cleared the sidewalks. However, they came so early in the morning like around five or 6 a.m., and it was still snowing. Later, I was going outside and the sidewalks were covered with snow again. I had put on my hiking boots and walked down the front walkway. I was thinking that the neighbor would notice my footprints in the walkway. I have no idea why that would matter. I didn't drive anywhere. I went back to my tool shed and got out my bag of sidewalks all. I was surprised at how little was left in there. There was probably less than 2 cups left. I could get around front, and I started by spreading it across the first step, right outside our doorways, than I moved down to the next step, but didn't even get that whole step done before I ran out. Seems that I may have thought about only using it on half of the sidewalk and go further down, but realize that would be very selfish and rude.",Negative

There was another one near us, which two people were dancing on. We turned to look and then Ezra made it go spazzy and Jayson and I fell off except some glass part came too and Ezra was fine. We fell into the water. We got out and there was this futuristic place with all these buildings and there was a little boat thing that went underneath the place which was on top of the water.

"I dreamed about this older couple who live next door to my parents in my hometown. They're in their late 50's or early 60's, I guess, and I dream about them, but it wasn't at their house in my hometown that they were and I had gone over there to visit them for some reason and we wind up in the back yard where there were a lot of unusual trees, all evergreens. There were very big pines and some other types of evergreens which they weren't telling me the names of and apparently quarreling about the different names of them, and they were trees that I never heard of before. I hadn't ever seen anything exactly like them. It was as if they didn't have any type of needle and everything. From here it seems that the scene sort of shifted so that I was on a picnic somewhere. I was sitting out in this not very attractive place, this big open space sort of on top of a little hill and way down the road to one side was a lake and I was with my husband and a couple of other people and we were just sitting there. Apparently we had finished our picnic, but we just hadn't packed up our things and gotten ready to go yet, although there really wasn't anything on the picnic table that looked like food. There wasn't anything on it at all that I can remember and we were being bothered by these yellow jackets and flies and things that were coming up to the table and we had a fly swatter and we were swatting them. My husband had to urinate and he went down by the lake and there was really no place along the lake that there was any shelter so he swam across the thing over on to this little island and then came back which struck me as being awfully silly because he was sopping wet and had all this stuff on him from this lake when he came back.",Negative

In this dream I'm telling Roger maybe we better not call this a dream because then Calvin will have to get up. I could have sworn I was awake. It seems like I must not have been exactly awake. There's something here about a Negro and I guess it's a girl in a bright yellow dress, very striking contrast of colors. For some reason I feel rather inferior to this person, and it has something to do with the thought here that in the dream it's this Negro and it's also like I'm thinking about it in general. That everything they gained, every recognition they gain, is in spite of being Negro. Whereas every recognition that the rest of us gain can reflect a number of things, not all of which are any of our own doing.",Positive

My plan is to let it crawl up to our height, then punch the glass collar though which it must pass to reach us. When the rat's head is beneath the glass I begin punching.

"Cindy S was dead. For some reason we had to exhume her body and there was someone else that we had to bury. I think we were going to bury this other person, maybe, right next to where she was buried. We didn't want to do it at the same time because we didn't want to impose on the S's while they were exhuming Cindy S's body. We talked to one of the S boys to make sure that wasn't going to be a problem. They assured us that it wasn't. Steve S was her brother. [but he was her cousin in waking life] I think Paul S was also her brother. [Paul S was also a cousin in waking life and deceased]. Maybe Tim S and Don St, though they are cousins also. In waking life, Steve S, Paul S, Don St and Tim S are all brothers. When they exhumed the body it wasn't in a casket but was wrapped in. It almost looked like aluminum foil but it was much larger than if the body was just wrapped in foil. It was like there were a lot of layers. I can't really explain it. I also don't know who the other body was that we were burying. Cindy S was alive again. Then she was dead again and they reburied her. After they reburied her I was wearing a necklace of hers. I don't know if she had given it to me or how I got it or why I was wearing it. Her father, not her waking life father, came in to church and sat down next to me because he had not been able to be present at the time that they exhumed the body and then reburied her because he had to be at a business meeting. I showed him the necklace to reassure him that it was her and that she was doing well and tried to give him some comfort. I thought how sad it was that on such an occasion that he could not be present because of a business meeting. We were back at the cemetery and I was picking up these sticks. In diameter they were the size of a pencil but they were much longer. On the end they had a kind of crook on them and they were light green. I was picking them up and sticking them in the ground at each gravesite that something had to be done to them. I was trying to find these open, vertical pipes or something so I could put the stick down into the pipe. I did four in a row. It was to mark the graves for something that had to be done later. Some of the graves had folded lawn chairs sitting up against the tombstones. People would come and sit there at the grave of their loved ones. One of them was Uncle E.

I ran my hand down his back and then through his hair, which felt rough and like dog fur, saying that I'd always wanted to do that. I told him it was a dream and to do a reality check.

"I was working at a hospital. I learned that Doctor C had gotten divorced. I saw him in the hallway, rounding a corner walking away from me. He was with a woman that seemed quite a bit younger than him. She was tall, thin, and had long, wavy, black hair. She was very pretty. He was taller in this dream than in waking life. He was going to whiten my teeth for me with a three-step process. He completed the first step then he took what appeared to be a small piece of white paper and place it between my two upper, front teeth. I pulled it out and there was a blue line on it where it had been between my teeth that had something to do with the whitening process. He told me to put it back in and that I needed to leave it in there for a little while. I think I was supposed to leave it there for ten minutes. I'm lying on my left side on an exam table, facing him. He is sitting across the room. While we're talking I was thinking about how much I dislike lying there looking like that in front of him.

I start taking the candles off of the meal cart and placing them on a table that has no wheels. As I'm doing this I turn to my left and ask someone about finding a small cart with wheels to put them on to take them to the other room. The person said this would be a good exercise for me to learn that sometimes what I already have is exactly the best thing to get the job done.

"The dream was of the experimental situation. I was lying here and had 2 or 3 electrodes loose. In tossing and turning, my hand had become caught behind one of them and pulled it loose. It seemed as if one of the others had gradually worked itself loose during the night. Then I was laying here awake for a while and it seemed as if it took Roger quite a while to come in to reattach them. When he did, it seemed as if there had been a female assistant outside the room who had heard a great deal of commotion, or heard the pens scratching, and realized that things were not as they should be. She had then gone upstairs to get Roger so that he could come down and take care of the situation. Roger and I then had some conversation while he was reattaching the electrodes. I then was lying here awake thinking that I would never be able to get to sleep. It had become very late during the night, and I was still waiting to fall asleep for an extended period of time. It seems that while laying here awake, that is dreaming that I was awake, I was saying something to myself about, ""Don't come in as yet because I haven't started to dream,"" because I'm often surprised when the monitor arrives as it doesn't seem as if he should have because a dream hadn't been taking place.

She has noticed as I just did that the top floor of the place where I work has been made into a free reading room for kids and she asks if anyone does anything around here that isn't free. It concerns her that no one is making any money. She is in the hall and my friend, Mary, is with her. As we speak a nurse comes and I look out and a big aircraft is flying over very low and cutting all the power lines. I am very frightened and try to hide so they can't see me. I eat my cereal even so because I am still hungry and I realize it may be a long time before I get any more.",Negative

Sitting on the end by the door was a fellow in my physics class at Reserve whom I don't even know.

"I got a job at Chicken Treat. I went out the back to the girl's toilet and there was only one and a girl was in there. I waited for her to leave and went in. I couldn't close the door and these other girls came in. I found out that the store was a cover and it was some weird sex place. The pay was good. There was a room with food; there were biscuits, kiwi fruit and other fruit. Some girl had been attacked by another girl at a party and had lost her boyfriend. She had a problem because of it. Ezra tried to work out what my job was, but only Mom knew.",Positive

I shouldn't be asking you to do things for me."" I then get into the next chair on my left. It's the power chair. I can't get it out of the closet-like room I'm in. I ask her for help, but she doesn't hear. I walk out and see my father and Hank lying on the floor playing a game like Monopoly. They ignore me.",Positive
"I had an orgasm in my dream last night, and I'm pretty sure I had one in real life too. I was lying on a beach and some guy, I don't know who, was touching me. We weren't having sex; he was just touching me. He was kneeling over me and holding onto this sword. Whenever he pushed his sword deeper into the sand, he touched me a little deeper. The phallic imagery is pretty obvious, but we weren't actually having sex. Anyway, it kept going like this until I had an orgasm and woke up from it. My god!",Negative
"My class was scheduled for 9 am. On the day of the first class I didn't wake up until 8:15. Even though I realized I should be there already, I was feeling so tired that I decided to lie down for just another few minutes. Unfortunately, I fell asleep and didn't wake up until 9:16. When I saw what time it was I was just frantic. I was rushing around trying to figure out what to do and the quickest way to get ready and get there. I decided I should call Judy A and tell her what happened, though I didn't know what I was going to say to her. This was so major, so bad, for me to do this. I went to the computer to try to find her phone number but then quit and asked Matthew to find it for me. As I was getting ready to go I realized that I had not even finished the preparation for the class. I didn't have my PowerPoint slides done or my structures. Matthew was telling me to calm down, but I thought that was just preposterous.",Negative
"I was looking into a box and picked up a cape made up of peacock feathers which I stroked. It was so soft. It was about 3.5 feet long. I asked mother where it came from. She said it was part of father's Chinese costume but I couldn't remember him ever wearing it. There were also some poinciana flowers losing their petals also in the box and 2 or 3 other articles I didn't get to examine. It was getting dark and I wanted more light to write. 2 or 3 others wanted to read but the boy, J, in the center of the room didn't switch on the overhead light, only ineffective side lights. I grew impatient and went to switch at door, ""Turn on this one."" But when I did there was no light. He said that the company wasn't sending enough electricity. I couldn't understand.",Negative

"I was at someone's home. They were having a party. I think it might have been a relative. I wasn't invited but it didn't bother me at all. I went upstairs, but had to step around food sitting on the steps. I thought I should go offer to help with the party prep. That it would be the right thing to do. People were beginning to arrive. They were talking about Suzie G's meringue. It was in a huge, trash-bag-size pastry bag. Later I went into the kitchen and Suzie was there. Something had happened to her meringue. It was out of the bag, in the sink, and piled high above the top of the sink. I told her I had eggs for her to make more.",Positive
"The Ill-Prepared Trip  I'm with my friends Nate Nelling, Kevin Simpson, Tiny Combs, and Olie Kecker. We're going to the Big Resort Area. We pack our gear. Nate, Tiny, and Olie seem to over pack: they bring sleeping bags that are seven feet long and plan to carry them. The bags seem to be inflated, in the shape of hot dog buns. They are bulky. I tell Kevin I don't know if my sleeping back is waterproof. My bag is the new blue one I got from my mom for Christmas. I stuff all my gear in a pack. Kevin has a big brown suitcase. We put our snow boots into the suitcase. There may be three pairs of boots. I realize I've forgotten the stove, and we discuss what we should do about that. I ask someone where the food pack is. I wonder if the pack is complete, and if the pots and pans are in it. We sit in an area that seems like the pit room at home, and talk about our options. Olie smokes a pink birthday candle.",Positive

"I wasn't sure where at first, but it turned out to be school.  At first there were like Ferris wheels or something.  Then we were recruited into a half-constructed house/warehouse.  It was kind of like a Navy thing, kind of like a prisoner deal.  All wood, no windows.  Everyone was on the floor, except for those giving orders.  They had us do pushups and such, but I couldn't get my right pinky out from underneath my other fingers.  The girl next to me was counting erratically.  Then we were supposed to pair up and construct wood panels to add to make a very thick front door.  I was alone in the task.  Then I was at home, and my maternal Grandma Jane was asking whether she should throw some white bagels away.  I was then back at college, and passed the swimming area; like a summer camp.  They were playing some song about 'fat girls'.  I woke up.  I went back, and had a sort of continued dream.  We gathered around the outside of the building, going to put up the door we'd made.   When we went to put the door up, we were punished for one of the panels (sandwiched) coming off.  I was going to go on the side of the building to try and fix it.  The house was to be some sort of gauntlet.  I stepped off the side, and in the field, bees started swarming me.  More and more with each step, flying around, on my face, my arms.  There was one on my left cheek that sort of tickle-hurt.  Like metal in a mouth with braces.  I haven't had a bee dream for a very long time.  I thought it was interesting, and refreshing, dreaming at all.",Positive
"I dreamed that I had emptied my cat litter box. The cardboard box that was rectangular and had the cat litter in it also had a small spout on the side that you could pour the cat litter out of and when I came out of the bathroom where I had been doing this, my mother, who had come over to the house said: ""that was laundry soap that you put in there, not cat litter"".",Positive
"Garlic Clove Skin Slice  I have a sore on my left hand. I seem to be in a place where a talk is taking place. I open a cupboard without getting up, and take a pin out of the tomato pincushion that is inside the cupboard. I see the pin is thicker, and is plastic. I use it, poking it into the flesh of the sore. A bit of flesh rips away a slice of skin, which seems to be dead and decaying.

I hide them up a tree, like figurines, and hope he doesn't see them. We almost make it, but they start moving and open their eyes and so he sees them. He puts them in a truck or the trunk of a car.

There is a chicken pox fish in with the leeches. It was a chicken pox fish that bit me. The area we were fishing is full of streams. There is an island between a braided stream area.

I see he is naked and I want to see what his penis looks like. He's kind of flabby and has dark, black, curly pubic hair and a dark-skinned, medium-sized, semi-flaccid penis. He starts to play with it to excite himself and I think, ""How weird. He knows the camera is there."" I watch, disgusted and fascinated.

When I wanted to stop it, I put on the emergency brake, but the car rolled downhill. I put on the brake pedal and it kept on rolling downhill and finally stopped. Kotnik was setting near a girl's legs and looking at them. I got close to the front of the car and there were small pin holes where the gas was squirting out. Bill and I went into the storage room. The place looked like a manure pile and Bill said it was bird shit. I saw some small springs and one large and very fine spring. A bull was chasing me. I flew and he flew after me.

The goal of the people talking to her is to make her give them the address of where she is so they can come and get her. They are going to give her cunnilingus until she tells them. Eventually it is going to get painful, and that will make her tell them. (This is a confusing dream.)",Positive

There is something on it though and the person with her looking at it thinks it is evidence that she killed someone. a relative. I'm watching the dream scene while listening to a conversation that is going on away from the scene. The scene is this woman driving, either on city streets or highways. It is dusk or dark because I notice the street or city lights. The conversation is about this woman the person she killed. They suspect her of killing one of her relatives. From what they saw in her trunk they are positive it was her. She is trying to justify it by saying how much he annoyed or irritated or bothered her.

He seems surprised and confused that he's there, as if he doesn't know how he got there. He tells me he came to see my sister Heather the other day. I believe him. This is his reason for being here. I had grabbed a knife, believing that he was an intruder: someone in the form of him, but not actually him. I put the knife, which is my army knife, down. The attic door, which is in my bedroom at home, is open. There is a picture on the wall that is tilted or fallen of an angel or spirit woman, like the picture that my dad gave Heather a while back. I look down at my clock on the floor, spilling a cup of water near my bed as the blankets fall on the floor. It's about 6:30am. The blankets on my bed are those from my flat on Ocean Avenue. I'm wearing underwear, and I cover up with a sheet, sitting or standing to deal with Ray. I may grab the knife again.",Negative

"There's a kind of party at my childhood home but it's more like an organised game of 'catch'. There's about 100 people in the garden, which has been lit up by lamps - it is after dark. The game involves throwing a large weighted rubber ball or balloon which others have to catch. It must not hit the ground. There may be two teams. We take it in turns to be high up (on the terrace) or low down (on the lawn). The other participants are young men and women - they are unfamiliar to me. The atmosphere is very sexually charged.",Negative
"I am looking at images of what went wrong in our marriage. Lots of snapshots, interviews; I remember the color black. I am helping my bad ex-husband set up a shower. It's a lot of tall, ungainly pipes. Between us we get it set up and the cold water pours out of the shower head. I take a cold, cold shower. I am fully clothed and find a small sample bottle of shampoo in my shirt pocket. I wash my hair and arms. I feel very invigorated by the shower because it is so cold. I step out and walk jauntily past my ex-husband and all the pictures. A voice (maybe my brother, Jake) says, ""Now, do me a favor. Give him the shampoo. You can work together a little bit."" I realize I had selfishly kept the bottle, which had only cost 75 cents. I gave it to him. [BL]",Positive

Charlie wondered what was going on and I whispered that Locke was told to kill everyone but himself and Kate and Charlie was upset and confused because he was close with Locke. Then Charlie and I were outside a building and there was a school nearby. An Asian lady came over and was speaking in an Asian language, then English and gave us a workbook. She took us to the teachers lounge or something. There was a TV and some spoof movie was playing. The food there looked very greasy and fattening. Someone asked who Jason Bateman's ""twin"" was and I said 'Justine', but that I didn't think they were twins and that she was older.

I don't know why but it seems that Alan K was there because I don't remember seeing him or anything. I just have this sense that he was in it. It also seems like there were two separate wedding dreams. At another one, the room setting was very similar but I went in and Uncle H and Aunt R were sitting there eating. There was a woman and an empty seat between them. I thought that maybe she could move over one so there would be two seats together but I don't think I actually said this. It might have been this one that I remember something about the women in the wedding party. The colors were pink, white, and black. Just one of the bridesmaids had a black bow in her hair.

"I saw my cousin clearly as she was being questioned and reproached by her father. Next to her was my aunt who also scolded her severely. The matter being discussed was that she had acted thoughtlessly and without knowing it, she had messed things up. I must confess that when I awoke, I thought this incident was true and that the dream had really taken place, and that their reaction (my uncle's and aunt's) had been okay. Thinking about it a good while, before breakfast, I remembered that this had never happened, and that everything was in order. I must disclose the fact that I would have wanted something like this to happen, because the problem went as follows: A few days ago, my brother's fiancé came to my home while my cousin was visiting. I told my cousin that this was a person my mother knew, and she, due to something that was said, thought that she was my grandmother's godchild. Naturally I only told her this because my brother had recently been engaged and he expressly asked us not to tell the family about it, in order to avoid comments due to the young age of the bride-to-be. But my mother could not hide the fact any longer and when my uncle came to pick up my cousin, she told him that her son's fiancé had come, but she didn't say anything to my cousin, and she didn't find out. The worst of it is that this incident has left me very nervous, and I don't even want to go to my cousin's because then she will ask me why I didn't tell her, etc. It's been a week since my cousin's visit, but all the members of my family, including my parents and myself, are very nervous about the reaction of the other members of my family. I think that this has influenced my dream a lot. Coming back to the dream: I remember that my uncle was telling my cousin, ""You are a fool; you shouldn't have said anything,"" and my aunt, ""What they must have thought!"" My cousin was answering, ""But I didn't buy the magazines, they gave them to me; besides, what was I to do? They were not going to throw me out of the house for letting him know that they were keeping so many magazines and hadn't paid taxes for them."" Her parents were still reproaching her, her lack of tact, until she lowered her head and left, while they made angry faces, as though they were angry at themselves.",Negative

There was a young girl in front of me. She had long blonde hair pulled up into a ponytail. It was bouncing and swishing around and hitting her in the face. I realized that I had my hair in a ponytail. I didn't think mine was swinging around as much but mine wasn't as long either. She was very clumsy and not moving very quickly. There wasn't room for me to get around her and I was getting frustrated. I wanted her to get out of the way so I could really start running. I was in the backseat with Matthew and Chris H. Three of their friends were in the front seat. I was feeling very sleepy so I leaned over and rested against Matthew. I don't know if I really slept or if I was just half-asleep. I had some kind of interaction with Chris H. I was thinking about the fact that he is such a nice man. I was more comfortable talking with him than I expected to be or than unusual.

We had a big boy named Quinn, like in his 20's, we had a big Derek, about 17 or so and we had a little Derek who was like 8 or 10. And the two big boys were alright; the girls were kind of reserved and shy like I was probably at that age. And the big boys were okay; they were like, I always saw them in camouflage and they would go hunting and stuff and fishing in the woods and stuff. The little Derek was scary, though. He had red hair and he would run around. He was a boisterous little thing. And, you know, I think I saw him near the keyboard a few times. He was carrying it around and running through the woods with it. And I can't remember too much about what happened during the dream or anything. I just remember that whenever the little Derek was around, I was really scared. And that's all I can remember. [Mom: I think you can identify with the big Derek, because he's your big brother that you talk to on the phone with music and stuff. But the little Derek is the little guy that scared you with the noises when you were little, and in your dream you've kind of combined both of them because they always, there was a while there where Derek and Ronnie were wearing camouflage and they were big boys compared to you when you were little.",Negative

"U.S.S.R. is taking over U.S.A. My house is the university. We're getting ready to move to the outskirts of the town so we can keep on the run from the Russians. The rest of my family are gone and I'm just leaving when the Russians pull up and I'm put under guard. Our house being so big, they decide to make it their headquarters. Mr. K. arrives. He is wearing a bright red coat. This is how I can tell he is Mr. K. I overpower my guard and put on his uniform. This enables me to go where I please. Mr. K. is giving a speech in a lecture hall. After his speech he walks past me and I salute him. He tells me that he is going to one of the portables to rest and that I'll be the only one knowing where he is. Big Deal. I just want to escape. Just then one of my brothers comes speeding up in a car and I jump in. We are driving along, when I think to myself, ""You still have the guard's gun and you are the only person who knows where Mr. K. is."" I decide I'd better go shoot him right now while I have a good chance. I tell my brother my plan and he says, ""Good deal,"" turns the car around and we are on our way back when I wake up.",Negative

"(02/13/00)[""Student cries rape.""] I am a teacher in a middle school. My class is large and noisy. Another woman teacher left her class and is sitting in on mine, for the fun of it.

I check my lesson plans. Looks like English lessons. The work ""is"" is being examined. I try to call them to order. The woman teacher is as noisy and disruptive as the girls. I call her to order and she smiles and quiets down. Now I ask one of the girls to do a speech. I decide this is speech class. She can't think of anything to talk about. I suggest she wait and let it come. Well, suddenly she begins to sob and tell us the story of her rape. She is a black girl now. I feel great sympathy. I go to her and hold her caringly and hug her, rocking back and forth. I feel sadness for her and I feel proud that she is talking about it.",Negative

"After my exams were over and I was in my last meeting of Electronics class, Mr. Martenson kind of really like surprised us and said that he wanted to take us all on a trip to the beach and stay there overnight, and so that we could look at the sunset and the wave length and the frequencies of light and how they change. And I was really surprised that we were going without any further notice, without any bags, without any anything. [laugh] And so the kids in the class didn't really want me to go because they were afraid that I would get lost, that I wouldn't know where I was going and what I was doing, and stuff like that, like I've always had to deal with. And I was just kind of bull-headed and assertive and said that I've been to the beach lots of time with my family and that this will be nothing. And so next thing I know, I was there and we were all sitting around and talking and I was swimming with them in the water. And we just kind of swam around and I guess we stayed the night; I don't even remember too much. But when we got back to the house, it didn't even look like what I'm used to. It was this big, fancy, ornate lobby which they're known for and I had to get something out of his class, so I had to go upstairs. Oh, for some reason we were sitting in his classroom that was more like a living room, and it was dark and we were just all talking about the trip and what a wonderful time we had. And then we all went out and I was kind of going in the opposite direction of all the people and waiting for a minute or two because there was this whole table full of candy. They had like big dishes with lids on them, and I'm sure that anybody could just go in there and get some. But then I kind of lost interest. They hung around and they hung around, and I figured I had to get home and I think at the time I had the cell phone in my pocket, and I turned it on in case they needed to locate where I was. And they had this -- it must have been three stories, but it was real open and each story had real high ceilings -- and there was this roundy roundy round, real narrow staircase, just about my arm span wide. So I was hanging on, each hand to a railing on each side of this running down these stairs and spiraling around and around until I finally, I didn't even get to the bottom and I heard them calling my name on the intercom. And I couldn't really say anything or yell out that I was on the stairs or anything, and the office was right in front of the staircase. And the office had clear doors like the Learning Support Center does. And I can't remember actually reaching the bottom, but I remember being in the office and meeting up with Dad and not knowing what was going to happen after that. And then I woke up.",Negative

This girl grabbed this guy's hand and went in. Someone sprinkled cinnamon on them to get a spell off. The guy went inside and this other guy made out with an invisible girl. Two guys were also making out. Outside in a forest, Dawson and Pacey (Dawson's Creek) were talking. Pacey and Jen (Dawson's Creek) suggested having sex and Dawson took it as an insult because he couldn't go through with it.

"There was a small half refrigerator and inside the door were 2 things for my father. One was cottage cheese and the other was an individual size container of Cool Whip--SUPERBRAND. I didn't know why my father had small individual servings. I had to go to the lake where relatives on my mom's side where having a family gathering. I did NOT want to go but I knew I had to. They were sitting on rocks at the river--which were covered with 3"" of water from the river. It was surprisingly clear for a muddy river. I knew I had to leave and to come back. I had to walk in the shady woods with Dora and we passed a contraption, number 5, on the obstacle course. It was circular cross-country skiing. Dora was playing on it but something stopped her. It was a(n) arrogant fat man in a white shirt and said, ""Can I take this apartment and take it down to the lake and bring it back."" And Dora said, ""Yes,"" so relaxed and calmly.

"Respectable Prostitution  I'm with Ben and Jill Gallon. Later it seems I'm with Jill and Grandma Redding. There is talk and jokes about sexual things. There is a sexual act occurring nearby. I'm tempted to get involved in it. I get an erection, outside a small shed, by myself. My next move would then be to confront the older women about fellatio and their denture-less mouths, or to go wherever this sexual act is occurring. Something happens with my flipping over two empty glasses, upside down. They're like the glasses Rob McDyss has given me to pour my beer into. I'm in a house where people have sex for money. It's more respectable than prostitution, which it is not. One can have sex anywhere on the body, within limits. People are employed to have sex and to allow others to have sex with them. I have sex with a large man. He is big and strong: hefty. He has dark skin and hair, like a traditional Maori. I think he's from the pacific islands. I don't know how it begins. I find him kneeling or bending over in front of me. My erection fumbles around, and then penetrates his anus, which feels tight and pleasurable. While we're having sex I ask what the instructions for orgasm are. They are: one is to stand up when they are about to orgasm and put their hands in the air (like they are being held up!). I do this, but not when I'm about to ejaculate: it's a trial experience for me. I leave before ejaculation. The man says something about the position of my hands above or below something, and how that alters the procedure for orgasm. When I stand up I'm naked, but am wearing my navy green t-shirt. I leave feeling guilty that I used these people because I didn't orgasm: I wasted their time. I walk into a kitchen where my friends Kevin Simpson and Stephen Ramos are. They're both naked, wearing towels around their waists. Both have erections. I walk up to them in my shirt, with an erection. This is a type of camaraderie: male bonding. There is nothing sexual about it, it seems.",Negative

Another fat woman comes up by the car. I stand up and hit her with a good-sized log. She throws a log at me back, and I dodge it. My neighbor Greg Olson may be the gangster. He scurries along the fence line between Broud's property and the house next to it, fleeing. Smalon gets in the back seat of the car on the driver's side. I run.

The McDyss' and I and maybe others are then eating dinner. We have fruit and vegetable salads. I don't think I'll get full, but I say nothing. Rob McDyss says we're having smoked salmon for dessert.

They're so big, the performers sit in them. Many performers come out, a huge black man, and a huge black woman with 6 breasts. The ""star,"" a young man with dark hair says, ""Now there's a woman! Hey, big mama!"" I am amazed. 2 older white guys sit down to sing an old folk tune. A woman sitting on my right sings with them. They sing very softly so they can assist her to sing. She's embarrassed and can't remember all the words. I'm a little envious. I'd like to sing too but I don't know the song. The performers throw gifts out to the audience. I catch a bunch of small Hershey bars. I pass them out to others, Rosemary, my ""daughter,"" and others. Then I catch some spearmint gum and pass them out, keeping one for myself. I've become the contact person in my area of the audience. I look in my purse and separate all my little presents into one section. I have necklace chains that have static electricity in them, little earrings, one shaped like false teeth, little costume jewelry pins, candy canes and some other stuff.

We put the pistons in, the rings in, the sonar head on, and we got his motorcycle all together, cooperatively, and we got it running.

"The locale of this dream is the bedroom of our Tree Frog Street apartment. This room is terribly cluttered and packed with furniture. I am trying to clean up and put the room in order.

I start taking these off the dresser, examining each closely for any damage, and looking for another place to set them until I can wipe the water off the dresser. While I'm wiping the dresser, Adam (as a young boy of about 10 years old) is helping me clean the room. He is smiling happily and is very involved in his work.

It was just the place was all to ourselves. And we were doing a bunch of things, I can't remember what, and it was our last night there and somebody warned me that they were going to have to do a fire drill just because it was in the protocol that they had to do it, but that none of us had to be there when they did it because they just had to test the alarm system. So I was getting dressed and I was getting my clothes on really fast, hoping that I could get out there before they actually did it. So I was getting dressed and I grabbed my bags and I slipped my shoes on and I went outside. And I put my bags by the truck, and I started walking down the alley a little ways so that I could be further away from the building, I guess. And I was just standing, when I thought I was far enough away. Well, Samantha, she comes out and she has this red thing in her hand. I guess I thought it was one of the sound emitters from the building [laugh], and she had it in her hand, and I start running, and she says, ""Oh, smart girl!"" And she catches up to me and she stuffs this thing in my back pocket, and I rip it out and I throw it and I keep running. And she grabs it and she runs after me, and she comes near me with it again, and I ran some more until I was far enough away and then I stopped. And then I dreamt that I was in class. I didn't know if it was Business Law class or one of my new classes for next semester, but I was in class and they were doing busy book work in class, which is very rare, and I was doing mine and I was looking at something that I wrote. I mean, I was looking, I had this paper and it was, it had a big design on the top of an Indian holding a bow and arrow, and I was looking at something that I had printed on it from my machine upstairs here, like I had a printer. And I printed right over the top of this bow and arrow picture, and it was a big, like half a page, picture. And it was something very personal. It was a journal entry about the thing in the last scene about staying in the picture, running away from Samantha.

I also beheaded Persia's body, which is under my bead. I talk to some people. They talk about where Annie is: where she will turn up, because she is missing. I go along with their talk, saying I don't know, but knowing full well that I've killed her. I get off the bus and walk towards a house where I live, which I don't recognize. It seems to be kind of a dump: maybe a trailer home. As I walk towards it I realize I've done something terrible for which there is no remedy. I'm guilty of a heinous crime. I'm overwhelmed with feelings of guilt, despair, and hopelessness. Even if I somehow tried to rid myself of Persia's body, the fact that there is no head would reveal my guilt. I realize that one bad action ruins all the good actions I've done. I don't know what to do. I know someone will find out what I've done. I walk into the house and someone I know or live with tells me there is an animal or something scary in my room. I go in my room. Loudly, I scare a small colorful snake out from under my bed.

It was stormy and we went outside to do something and around the side of the house it was pitch black in the distance and a thick grey fog just in front of us. It was getting closer and weird noises were coming from it - like a whispering static. Someone else with us went into it and we ran back inside, but it had caught up and it was pitch black inside. Once it had enveloped us, the sound stopped and I couldn't see or hear anything. We had referred to it as both 'The Silence' and 'The Nothing' [the first made me think of Doctor Who and the second of The Neverending Story so I couldn't decide which one I preferred]. We were stuck in there for a year, then it went away. Only the three of us who had been caught in it had been 'gone' for all that time though.",Negative

"My boyfriend Jeremy went with me to the doctor.  I took off my blue jeans and underwear, thinking I was going to get a pelvic exam.  The doctor came in and measured the extension of my jaw, then the distance of the stretch of my cheeks.  She turned around to do something and I realized I was still pants-less and tried quickly to put them on, embarrassed at my mistake, that she was a jaw doctor not a gynecologist.  I talked to my paternal Grandma Fay on the phone.  She was sad about something to do with Christmas tradition, someone not showing up.

I kept having trouble dialing.  I talked to a man on a wrong number, and then took the phone into the family room.  I tried dialing again, and again got the number wrong.  Several seconds later, Santa Claus arrived, landing his sleigh in the family room, because I'd called him.  Then Jeremy and I were on campus, leaving one class to go to another.

We walked to the left toward the truck, passing some angry dinosaur-like flamingos.  Something to do with a black person named ""Matt Willis"", perhaps supposed to be a classmate from elementary school.  Then we were across campus.  There was some question as to whether woman we had been behind on the steps was pregnant.  It seemed like an odd thing to consider- I perceived of her something like Claire Huxtable.  Then she was on an operating table, seemingly having an abortion.  Bits of things were everywhere; it was disgusting.

They were talking about shipping out dreams, I think. They shipped them out of here in these like steel cylinders, the kind you get oxygen in. They were talking about how they get the cylinders from somewhere near, but how they plug up the bottoms with rocks because the cylinders are gotten from toilets, but sometimes they don't get rocks in them. Sometimes they come up without rocks. Sometimes they're kind of dirty inside. And they laughed about that. Then they said, ""Of course, sometimes we just throw in rocks."" They got a kick out of that. Then there was one other thing. They were talking about the fact that divers -- now I guess these cylinders reminded them or reminded me of divers because they were like oxygen things, the divers were. I think then maybe it was Max that was saying divers, you know, have regular appetites because after they dive, they're real hungry. So they can eat. But in this country, if you have those cylinders and you're not a diver, you're not necessarily hungry when you come up from the water or wherever you come up from.",Positive
"I was suppose to meet William at the state park. The state park had 8 underground park levels connected by elevators and steps. I didn't know which level I was suppose to meet him at. He had called on the phone to say that he WAS in the park. There was a vendor with a hot dog stand under an umbrella, selling popcorn only. I tasted it and it was very greasy and salty. I decided not to bring popcorn for the class picnic. Then I thought I might be in the wrong park so I went on the highway. (I was driving a car) I was suppose to take EXIT 7 but I missed it and I got off at EXIT 8. There was no state park in sight. There were wall-to-wall buildings. Tall and crammed together. There were flashy billboards all over the sides. Overpasses crossed over the highway everywhere. I knew I had to get back to EXIT 7 which HAD been the right place, but I wasn't looking forward to driving in the middle of all that crazy speeding traffic, red lights, buildings suffocating each other, loud tacky signs--general chaos.",Negative

"I was walking all alone down what must have been a quiet street, as I remember no traffic noise of any sort. As I passed one rather large house, music floated out to me, and I became quite angry because I could not think of the name of the piece. It began to rain then, but instead of hurrying on my way I stood and listened to the music. I was just about ready to give up when a low soft voice said ""don't you remember that, my dear."" I turned, but no one was in sight. Then the voice said, ""that is Beethoven's 4th. How could you ever forget."" I looked frantically around but could see no more. Something made me look at the house for a moment, and for a second I saw a lovely face watching me. She seemed to be crying, yet I wasn't sure.

"I dreamed that Chuck Branden, my boyfriend (22) and I were in the Lasalle Theatre. There were about four other young boys in the show with us, all unknown to me, and all about the age of 10 to 12.

I was laying down on a couch and Chuck was sitting beside, me, but I don't recall what we were talking about. Then the scene shifted and I was in a school room. The room resembled the school where I attended the second and third grades - Roosevelt Elementary School in Euclid, Ohio. There were about 15-20 students, none of whom I remember. My husband, Chuck, was the professor. I was sitting in the front row to his right conversing and acting silly with the girl who sat next to me. I knew my husband was getting angry with me and would bawl me out when we got home, so when the bell rang, I rushed out of the door and didn't wait for him.",Negative

"There are two women in this dream. I make love to each of them within a short span of time -- within the same day or maybe within a few hours. I don't know who the woman is that I first make love to. It may be Bonnie. I see myself making love to the second woman. I can't see her face clearly at the outset, but do see her later. I believe it is Mary. I am sure it is Mary. I do not see her face during lovemaking, but do so afterwards. We are making love in a standing position. When I attain an erection, I want to have intercourse in the ""doggy"" position, with her back to me. Instead of having the woman on her knees, I have her bend forward from the waist. But I lose my erection and cannot penetrate her. We are walking up Idlewoods Avenue. It is now that I see the woman's face. It is Mary.. When I had made lover to her, I told her that this was the second time I'd made love today -- that I had made love to another woman earlier. We walk past a house on Idlewoods where we had had a flat in the early years of our marriage. As we look at the house, the veranda has the appearance of a kitchen sink draining board. It is loaded with plates, one stacked upon the other. They had recently been washed and are glistening with water.",Negative
"I was in class on Friday and that my Spanish teacher was like a gifted teacher and a Spanish teacher combined. And she was like talking about these intellectual things and all, and on Friday I dreamt that she assigned us a paper to write in Spanish about our life and how it has been unfolding up to this point. And I was thinking that I would be able to do this because I was feeling confident about being able to express myself in Spanish, but I was feeling completely distraught over the fact that I thought I was going to have a week off, but here now I have this paper that I have to do, and that I'm going to have to do it on my trip because I have no other way to do it. And then, as I was slowly fading into consciousness, I was realizing that, hey, this is a dream, I don't even have Spanish class on Fridays and I got my Ethics paper done. And I know there was more to it, but I can't think of it at this time. And then that was it.",Positive
"A family member or a friend and myself were visiting some people in another town. I don't know the name of the town or even what state it was in. At one point during the dream it was winter and there was a lot of snow on the ground. While we were at this house, the wife was telling us about some chairs that her husband makes that are so soft and comfortable to sit in. She said people just love them. There was a pile of different size cushions sitting on the floor. Some were as small as 6 x 6. Others were large. the size of a regular chair cushion. She was explaining how her husband uses these different sizes to fit them in the frames of these chairs. I had grabbed one of the large ones and two of the small ones and was trying to find different ones that would work well to fill up the seat frame of this chair, but they didn't. Then, either someone told me or I realized that I was using the wrong thing. There were bundles of fabric sitting there. The fabrics were all accordion folded and then banded together so they would stay together. I don't know what they were banded with. The fabric itself felt really soft, like cashmere. They were different colors. They reminded me of winter scarves. I learned that was what he used to make these chairs. He just fit these bundles of fabric together. So, I started doing that, using those. They were different sizes and different colors. With those I was able to make a cushion of sorts on the seat frame of this chair. I commented that they reminded me of Matthew's red winter scarf, how they felt and how they looked. The chairs didn't have much of a back on them. The back was maybe only 6-8 inches high. I wondered how that would be comfortable. There was something besides just the frame but I don't know what or how. After I did get the frame of the chair filled in I sat down on it. It was comfortable. With the back the way it was it surprised me that it was as comfortable as it was. I don't know that it was as soft or as comfortable as I expected it to be from what I had been told. But it was comfortable. It struck me as odd that that was how he made these chairs. that he didn't use any kind of covering for these bundles of fabric. He just put those in there and that was that. There was someplace that I either needed to go, wanted to go, or simply decided to go to. I asked someone to give me a ride and then did. I don't remember where it was. After I was ready to return I just walked. I realized that it was just about a two-block walk and that it was silly for me to have someone drive me there previously. It wasn't snowing then. The weather was nice. I don't remember it being cold. I was back at the house and I decided it was time to go. Whoever it was that was with me, family member or friend, - we got ready to go and they and I disagreed on the path to get home. the route we needed to take to get home. They were going to go one way and I was going to go another. Somehow we kept ending up at the same place. either because we couldn't get through the way we wanted. I was standing there and there was a local town person there telling us to wait for this small train. I don't know if we missed the train or if the train neglected to stop. It was now snowing and the weather was really bad. The train was the type of train that you might see in an amusement park. it reminded me of the old train at Lesourdesville Lake.",Negative

"Stealing A Donut  I'm walking through a shopping mall looking for a waffle house. There are many breakfast food shops. I walk by a bunch of places that are open for business and are well lighted. I enter an area that is darker and deserted, the lights are off. There is a lot of food left sitting out on a table, with plates. It appears that people, including employees, just got up and left. It's late morning/early afternoon. These places must only be open for breakfast or brunch, I think. I see a deserted fancy restaurant, with some donuts left sitting out. I creep over in the dimly lit room and take a donut with red filling. I then creep over towards a piano that is near a wall, out of view from the restaurant entrance, just in case someone comes along. I sit down on a chair next to the piano and start eating the stolen donut. An alarm above my head goes off a few seconds after I sit down. It blares loudly. I get up and run away. I slip and slide, having no good traction. A man sees me running. I realize he knows it is I that is the culprit because I'm running. I try to change his mind by talking to him.

I was at a shop with Calvin and we were later joined by Evelyn. She had a lot of meat and rice in her trolley. Later I was watching Grey's Anatomy. Sloane and Derek were in a room lying on a bed.

"I'm on a little trip out of town, trying to get hold of four papers - some sort of legal documents from the city or county or something, that this little lawyer says I need.

What a nuisance. I go back and pick up my stuff, and aim for the exit door that leads to the parking lot. Then I hesitate, thinking that I might make better time if I go the other way down the interior hallway. I start that way, stop again, change my mind again and go the other way. Whle we were travelling up here, I kept thinking about getting to a coffee house somewhere. I'd been looking forward to that more than finding the courthouse and getting these papers. Now, since we found the courthouse first and I've gotta go right back now, heaven knows when I'm gonna get any coffee. Nuts.

"My mother and wife and I were in the car going to the grocery store. On the way to the grocery store we were having a rather philosophical discussion in which my mother was saying modern society was degenerate and the old ways were the best ways. Anyway, I was driving along and I pulled out on Dixie Highway, and the front of the car kept off the ground as we passed a policeman who was parked in the middle of Dixie Highway doing something. We went a little ways like this and then the front of the car came back on the ground, and we drove on until we got to the grocery store. I was back looking at the wines, and they had some wines from Spain. They were sauternes in silver paper and gold paper covered bottles. They had some real old wines there. I could read the labels -- 1917. The bottles were various shapes and sizes, some being tall and square and others just being squat and fat. Then I went over where they had this display counter with these little figurines and carving from Japan that were for sale. They were quite commercial. There was nothing worthwhile. But I looked at them for a while anyway -- wooden bowls and stuff. They were machine cut and they were not very good. That was all the dream. Hall: The whole front end of the car, including the wheels and the fender, sort of raised up off of the ground.

"I was having a duel with some young teenage hood and apparently I was one myself. We both had pistols and I think a couple of kinds of pistols. One was a little 22 and the other one was something bigger - I don't know what. My pistol wouldn't work right. I knew that his would if he ever got a chance to fire it at me. He probably would kill me, but mine wouldn't work. As a matter of fact, I held it right up next to him and the bullets, I held it right up to his back and shot the whole 22, well the whole 6 shots, into his back and they only made these tiny little places and the bullet didn't go in. They just disappeared or something. Then it got very involved and complex because somebody had sent one of these pistols to the professor who teaches my Greek drama course. He was talking about it being some sort of strange Greek ritual, that there was a procession in which this should be carried. Of course, that's interesting because it would be a phallic symbol and he was talking about how the phallus is carried in, in my course. Anyway, he was talking about the procession in which this is going to be carried and I was afraid that I was going to be killed in the first place. I was afraid I was going to be arrested. I knew they were out looking for me, all these people were, so I went down off the road down the bank, this steep hill that was covered with quite a few trees. It wasn't real heavily wooded and there were stones sort of arranged like steps and down sort of forming a sign of the Z on the side of the hill. There was a shelter over the central part of it. A wooden shelter and I was going down under that and all these people were running around looking for me, but they didn't would have done anything like this, so they didn't stop me.",Negative
"At first I wasn't going to record it, but then I realized if I'm going to be true to myself while I'm doing all this psychoanalysis, I have to record it. I can't just portray myself favorably like human nature says we do, because then I'd be calling the kettle black, trying to figure out everybody else's mishaps. So no matter how embarrassing it might be at times, I'm going to try to tell all that comes into my life. I dreamt that Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town, and they were kind of planning something for me for Christmas, and come to think of it, we were planning surprises for each other for Christmas. And we had just come back from some beach thing. I think we were coming back from a long walk on the beach that was nice, and we were all riding in this van - Samantha and Sandra and Derek, Nikki and me. And Mom and Dad were there. I sort of like had the notion that they were there because I heard them talk, but some driver was driving us around, like one of my cab drivers. And we were talking about various things, I can't remember what exactly. But Dad was asking me questions like, apparently in my dream he had heard my CD that I had burned from Music and Computers class, which I really haven't burned it yet, and he was asking me questions like, ""How did you do all this stuff?"" and ""Do you know how to play any songs?"" and this and that and the other. And the van driver stopped and we all got out, and we went into this place that was kind of like the foyer area of the Radisson Hotel that we go to for awards and ceremonies sometimes, except this place was carpeted, and it was big and spacious. But I didn't know exactly where we were, but it was someplace fancy and elegant. I kind of had the notion that it was a furniture store because there were couches and chairs and tables and stuff spaced out all over everywhere. And I think there was a staircase off to the side, and it was kind of brownish carpeting. And Dad had me -- think it was Lee, I don't know if it was Lee of Dad -- but one of them had me sit down at this set of keys, like the model we have in school, and play ""Joy to the World."" And I put my hand at the top of the middle C octave, but as I was descending down the scale, like you do in the first line, I realized that the thing was like up sideways and I like, I don't know how to explain it, but it was like instead of horizontal, it was almost vertical. It was kind of like at an angle almost. And after you got down to G, the C octave just kind of disappeared and you had to take your thumb and go along the side of the unit with these ""dup dup dup dup"" things on the side, these little rounded keys after G. F, E, D, C were on the side; they were little rounded things. And it got more and more horizontal and more and more horizontal, and then I realized it was all white, but amazingly enough I was able to play this song perfectly. And Dad was pretty amazed, and he said, ""You have to have one for Christmas."" And he said that this model that we were sitting near was kind of an old-fashioned type of model, and he was in search of one that was, I don't know, like a few generations up, I guess you could say, you know how units are. But somehow I wasn't really supposed to know [laugh] and Sandra -- we were back in the van and Sandra was like, you know how Sandra is in surprises -- she's very good at keeping them. And then -- what should I say? -- down, a little while later the scene just shifted, and I was in the dining room and I saw the manual for the model that I was going to have, and I was going to take it over to the monitor and read some of it.

"There was a small restaurant or drive-in, sort of like a McDonald's or Gino's.  The owner was a fairly big, gruff fellow, an acquaintance of mine.  My daughter Christina was with me, and I used her as bait to attract Jane Fonda, who was at the restaurant, not as herself, but playing the part of a pick-up.  We were at tables at an outside patio.  Later, I was sitting in a car with Jane Fonda, who had put a loaded pistol under some newspapers or clothes on the back seat.  I asked her if it wouldn't be better to have it in the glove compartment, where she could get to it more quickly if she needed it.  She said she was afraid it would go off when we went over a bump or something.  Just then a little Japanese guy with a gun came sneaking around the front of the car to her side (the passenger side) to mine.  He was going to kill us for some reason.  The door on my side was open, and when he came around it to shoot us, I got the gun off the back seat and fired it behind my back, behind the seat, through the open front door, and killed him instantly.  He hadn't even fired his gun yet, so at first I tried to make his finger pull the trigger of his gun, so that I could claim self-defense more convincingly.  When I couldn't do it right away, however, I decided it would be too obvious, with the length of time between the two shots.

They wanted Linda and my friend Faye to go out and get them next summer. Linda said she was too tired to go; she had worked hard all summer and needed the rest. So Faye said she would go and asked me to go along to keep her company. I said sure I would. Faye told me that we were going to fly out and the trip would cost $1000.00 and we were going to live there a month. So I asked my parents if I could go and if I could have a thousand dollars, and they said sure, for me to have a trip to the Rocky Mountains it was worth it. Linda said she would go a little ways with us and then she would get off and come back. So we started out and we were in the plane and some fellow on the plane gave me a present. It was a compact with a combination of rouge, lipstick, powder and cold cream all in the compact. We were going up a great big mountain and it was raining, and we got to the top of this real high mountain and the pilot said he had a terrible feeling this was going to be his last flight. He had flown 35 years, but this was the end. And Faye said, ""Oh dear, I believe in hunches. We have got to get off this plane."" So we decided we would get off at the next landing and look for another plane. And I was going to call my mother and see if it would be all right with her, so I called her from the plane. And she said sure, she wouldn't care if I had to get on a plane that was going to Tokyo first and then coming back to the Rocky Mountains, just as long as I would be safe. So the plane landed on the side of the mountain and we three got off and we were walking through the rain looking for another plane.",Positive
"The dream took place in a hotel where I was staying. There was a lot of confusion and noise. Everyone around seemed to be happy and festive. There were a lot of young people there. I was discussing things of interest with them. Then I was in another room. And in this room, in the bathroom, next to the bathtub, was a huge chair set up high. The chair itself was yellow leather and it was braced with large pieces of wood and made to look like a throne. The bottom of it was decorated in white tile, as was the bathroom. Then I noticed that draped here and there were rhinestone bracelets and necklaces; and gold belts with pseudo-jewels in them. Later I learned that this throne was used as a prop for the stage play of Macbeth. The person to whom it belonged was a young man about 27 years of age. He had dark hair. Someone was asking him how he got so many people to give up their rhinestone necklaces, bracelets and gold belts permanently for the construction of this throne. This man kept saying that the people didn't mind at all. This seemed to cause an argument between the two. Then I woke up.",Positive
"I remember coming to Santa Cruz with my best friend in her car. It was about 3 or 4 o'clock PM. We had been in the car for about three hours or so by now, when her car all of a sudden stopped. At first we thought, it doesn't have gas so we will have to walk the rest of the road until we get to Paso Robles. So, we did. We got there and I remember that I was using a pay phone talking to my boyfriend and telling him what had happened. Then I woke up.",Negative

"Mom, Ezra and I went to Midvale shops. It was dark and raining. We had a 4wd type of car. Mom went into the shop and Ezra and I waited outside. It flooded and there was a deep 'hole' next to the car. It all filled up and it went past my door at the back of the car. It wasn't past the door on Ezra's side (the left side). Mom called Darren to tell him to get something to get us out. Mom came out later to check on us and Darren still hadn't come -- he had seen a friend instead. Then we were somewhere else and this Cloverfield thing happened. The monster was throwing stuff around. It went over a bridge holding 'balls' of people (they were wrapped up in a ball). I was looking up at it. These people had also bought a new home. After the flood and the monster, I was wondering if they would get a new house (the house they had had survived, though). We were hanging around and Thuy and Raquel were there.",Negative
"Last night I dreamt that I was at a party. It was a small room, about 18 X 12 feet, with lots of lights, which were yellow. As more of the guests arrived, the place got hotter because to me the lights represented the sun and I thought that when 12 o'clock came, the temperature would be very high because when I go to the beach, that is the time when one gets more tanned. It was about 7 p.m. and we kept on dancing. I was with some very good friends of mine from different places, but they hardly knew each other. I remember that I often looked at my watch as though I were waiting for someone. I started to talk to a lady in green, fat and of a rather advanced age, and she continuously asked me why I had come alone and had not brought my girlfriend. She asked me her name and I told her that it was Edith and that we weren't going steady any more and were just friends. We hadn't quite finished the conversation when suddenly, as one more guest, Edith, came in. we only looked at each other. I wanted to go and greet her, but couldn't decide to do it because there was a great indifference between us. In the middle of the party, I was talking to her sister about places in Peru which I have never seen and we heatedly disagreed until the end of each song. Around 11 p.m. the heat was unbearable, so I decided to leave the party. I didn't say goodbye to anybody and got out, finding that it was raining, in contrast to what was happening inside. I don't know how, I found myself in bed, thinking that I was going to sleep very peacefully and the first one to disturb me was going to be told off because I very much wanted to sleep. It ends here.",Negative
"Thursday I had a dream that our sound system needed some rewiring. It was not at its full potential, but it could be run. And Dad was going to run a wire down through the wall at the northwest corner of the living room and under the floor for some reason. And we had baby chicks and Loretta was the mother.

"(11/03/97)[""Just had a baby, looking for my granmere.""]  I have two rooms and I have lots of stuff in both rooms. And I am packing things up and I go from one room to the other to pack up lots of clothes and papers and things. And then I'm go apparently to M City but on the way I stop at a candy factory store. I'm in my wheelchair and I go into the building and I look at the displays of candy and so on.  I had gone the accessible way but I decide to go back through the front, where everybody else goes. This required  going on an escalator. This is exciting. The escalator went up and all of a sudden at the top, there was this drop off and no hand rails so I looked down and I could see there was the tip of another escalator there so, I went on to that and hanging on to the round and metal handrails on the left side and I did that 2 or 3 times. Each time, I'm not quite sure the escalator will be there underneath me. Each time it was. The last escalator was a series of black padded steps that rotate and drop you from one step to another. Pretty exciting. At the bottom I see some people were watching. One had a video camera and I thought that was cool. I'm trying to find my way out to the front door and some woman dropped her bag of candies and they're all over the floor and a clerk was trying to help clean it up. It was a liquidy mess. She asks what kind of candy is this. The woman told her, because they are going to replace the candies. Now I'm not in a wheelchair because I am barefoot and am going to tip toe through the mess. Without getting any of the mess on me. Now I'm going down a long aisle like in a store. I'm in my wheelchair again. Behind me I see Mabel and Dominic. Dominic looks terrible, like he's balding and like he's had cancer. He looks old and pale. I yell behind me. Mabel, Dominic, Hi. I've had a baby. Come see.  They say hi, but they don't really stop. A woman says hello did you have any luck finding GranMere Madeleine? And I realized that a year ago I was in this store looking for information about my great grandmother. And I'm embarrassed to tell her I had done nothing with the information for the past year.  I wondered if I would see someone I had met doing that search. I say, well, take a look at my baby.  She pokes my belly and I say that hurts. I just had a baby 2 days ago.  Look at my baby and reach into my handbag. The baby is so tiny that it's cradleboard is the memo notepad like the one Dwight and Corinne gave me for my birthday. So the baby's like and inch to 2 inches in total  length. I pick it up and turn it over with some concern. Hopefully the baby is still breathing. I wasn't paying much attention to it. I had kind of stuffed it into the handbag without much attention to it. But it is OK, and the baby is sleeping. I hold it in my hand to show it off and they all ooh and Ah. Then I head on out the door. I see  the van. To the left appears my mother and father in a lovely red convertible sports car and they are going to  drive with me and my old van and them in their lovely sports car in tandem to M City.",Negative
"I was watching Lost, although I'm not sure if it was, and Locke and others (from other shows as well) had to break into this giant shed, which had planes in it, in the middle of the forest. Some of them were on a plane and Locke was trying to distract the people outside. He was then on the roof and this girl up there suspected him and threatened to tell and there was a long drop to the bottom. They were both holding on to the edge and she let herself drop but he kept edging along to the water and when he got close he let himself fall. I was then there with some others, outside and it was night, and we had to get in. There were guards, but lots of bushes and things to hide behind along the way. We slowly made our way to the shed. This girl sacrificed herself so we could go (they arrested her, and then we snuck in while they were busy). I watched some comedy movie [it was new and Apatow like]. It was ok. Jack Black was in it and they had this thing to get rid of fire, which was a gigantic grey flap thing and he said it ""works like my kidneys"" and it was at the door or window and it 'breathed' and sucked the smoke and flames out. I was telling Ezra if he'd seen anything else similar to it. I went to the kitchen and Mom was there. I asked her if she had some food and Darren said ""pdf"" and he said it stood for ""do not prefer"".",Negative
"Am driving a busload of people who have paid for a tourist travel trip to a southern state. We arrive at the state line where I am stopped for a traffic light. Also realize that I am not familiar with the traffic regulations of that state. I look up at light and there are no colors, then look again and it is green. We continue down the road and then later someone else, a young man in dark purple shirt and matching trousers, is driving us, but the front of the bus inside seems more like a trolley car and he is manipulating the lever as we continue along. He drives up and down the hills and I note they are getting steeper and steeper. Finally in desperation he turns to me as we climb a hill and says he is using all the speed he can get and that we are just about able to make the hill. If they get worse, we won't make it. Ahead I see several grades, but they are small. We reach a plateau and in the distance to the left of the road we see some majestic mountains in the distance. They are misty and the sky is blue and the sun is strong. I realize the rugged mountains are the Rockies and also that I didn't know this southern state was so far to the West. We continue and finally the road ahead narrows until there is only one lane. Our vehicle fills the whole road. Ahead I see that the road swerves, has dangerous turns and then finally unbelievably, it actually turns on its side perpendicular. When I see that, I am furious because the state trooper had not warned us that the road was so bad. I realize we will have to go back and that the tourists will get a refund. I wait at the side of the road as the man in purple shirt walks ahead to see how the road looks. Then a sports car comes by and roars ahead and sweeps around the perpendicular road and is gone.",Negative
"Lighting A Fire  I'm in a group of people on the Carter School playground, east of the jungle-gym equipment in the open area. People get into smaller groups to make fires. It seems almost to be a competition for wood. I pick up some branches for a fire that I'm making with another man. There are two large fallen tree trunks, and we put twigs and branches around these trunks to get our fire started. We light it. In a short while it has gone out and is smoldering. I think some of the wood may be green. Someone lifts up one of the huge tree trunks and we find four or six cardboard boxes, which look like the Henry Weinhards boxes we have at the Whitman House, crushed underneath it. We try to get the fire started again using books of matches. I try to light it, but I run around the felled tree to light the fire after I have lit the matches. The matchbook flares up and goes out before I can light anything. There is a breeze, which makes things a lot more difficult. It is getting dark. A person tries to light some of the cardboard with a match. A group of us crowd around to block out the wind. I use my hands to cup around the match. It works, and we light a piece of cardboard right in its center, and a hold burns through the cardboard.",Negative

"I had left Lima with S. (a girl I was very much in love with a long time ago) going to Piura. We expected to get there hiking and each of us had equipment. We got to Trujillo and I decided to go see the Chan-Chan ruins. There we found a common friend of ours. He suggested we climb to the top of the ruins (many people did this, helping themselves with a rope). I said alright and we started to climb. S. stayed below, looking at us. We were about halfway up when suddenly I stepped the wrong way and caused a huge stone to fall. Terrified, I looked at where S. was and saw that a little girl was next to her, watching us climb. The stone fell in between the two of them, without hurting them, and left a huge hole in the ground. I felt uncomfortable thinking of what people who were seeing my clumsiness must think. Later on I was in the park in Trujillo and I saw B. (a girl with whom I flirted recently) going by on a motorcycle with N. (another girlfriend of mine) on the back. I saw them turning a corner and went behind them, leaving S. I arrived and tried to talk to N. B. was silent. Then a boy who is a classmate with whom I have a very strong and reciprocated feeling of dislike came over and hugged N. and she was very nice to him. Then I understood that she was his girlfriend and felt disappointed that she should have chosen him, of all people.",Negative
"Recalled fragment: I was an FBI agent or something like that, and I had defected to the enemy, who seemed to be rather primitive natives of some sort. I had gotten rather romantically involved with this native girl, but I think I was ambivalent in my feelings. Then I was captured by the police and FBI, who considered me very dangerous, but were also sorry that I had defected. I don't recall my reason for defecting, but it was on the order of doing something that was good for my country in the long run, even if it hurt them immediately.

"I was in a house that I lived in with 3-year-old Matthew. It was the middle of the day. We were outside. Matthew was riding his big wheel. I was walking while he was riding. We had gone quite a little distance. He had asked me something and then I turned away from him. When I turned back I couldn't see him anymore. Even though it looked like a straight view as far as I could see in all directions around me, I couldn't see him anywhere. I just panicked. I started running and yelling and calling out his name. I couldn't find him. I finally decided I didn't want to walk away yet. I knew that I couldn't move very fast this way because I was walking. I finally decided to go back to the house and get the car and drive to find him. So I went back to the house and got my keys. I was dressed for work. I went outside to get in the car and there he was - sitting there on his big wheel, looking as though he knew he was in trouble and he was so dirty. Before I could say anything, he was talking - as though he was alot older than three - you didn't even have to say it. I've been yelled at by, I don't know whom, but these other people already yelled at him. So I didn't say anything right away. I picked him up and held him but out away from me because he was so dirty and I didn't want to get my work clothes all dirty. I took him in the house and thought about sitting him down but he was so dirty and I didn't want to get the dirt all over the carpet. So I took him into the bathroom and was going to just sit him right in the tub. It was as if he was cooperating with his body. I said okay fine. So when I actually went to sit him down he ended up on his stomach and kind of sliding down. But then he ended up sitting up.",Negative

"I'm in a swimming pool. Ginny and I are swimming. I stay near the edge. People keep getting in my way. They cling to the edge too and once I had to swim around them. As get to the shallow end, I walk, limping. I notice they have removed all the water from the pool. Also I see a bunch of older people walk by. They are being led to the children's wading pool. One old guy's bare butt shows like he is wearing a hospital gown. The water is all gone because they clean it and return it at half-time. The water starts to come back in. As it does, a cage or screening drops over the pool and we are turned full circles. At the point where I'm upside down, with the water rolling in over me, is very frightening. It's akin to carnival rides. It happens several times. Then it's swim time again. A boy comes to me, holding a soggy pair of ear muffs he has found in the pool. He is deaf. I tell him to take it to the lifeguard. At first I shout, forming my words carefully. Then I try finger spelling. He takes them to his mom, also deaf. She takes them to her husband (a counselor at a conference I met and also a friend of Rachel's, an ex-priest, now married). He is deaf also. I painstakingly finger spell, wishing I had learned sign language because it must be frustrating for him to have to converse so slowly. He holds the ear muffs up to the crowd and tries to speak. He has a voice, but he sounds deaf. Everyone in the pool shuts up and is embarrassed. I intervene and scold them for being insensitive and fearful and ignorant about disabilities. I then can't remember the sign for ""B."" I ask someone, Ginny or Bonnie. He then signs, ""We'll do the alphabet together so we know we're using the same signs."" His hand is small and his fingers are also deformed; nonetheless, we both can make the signs. Then a girl in my class leaves the pool. Her boyfriend is harassing her. I follow and intervene. The boyfriend (Rosemary's Cory), is being very obnoxious and verbally threatening. I tell him to leave.",Negative

The show was held outside in a field thing. There was a big stage. I can't remember what happened at all, but it was pretty fun. There were lots of lights and stuff. Then it was inside. There were lots of kids in the show. Something weird was happening and they were taking people? I either went on stage or was talking to Zombie and he took my wallet? I went to leave coz I thought they were going to take me and I went out the exit and then realised he had my wallet. I went back in and wondered how I was going to get it. I was with the kids and they seemed to think something was going on too. A lady came and said they were looking for Eleanor or something similar to that, which was a codename thing. I said confidently, 'It's me,' even though I knew it meant they were going to take me (it was to save the kids??). She said to follow her and we got to the edge of the stairs at the stage and she said they'd be a while and asked if I wanted to sit. So I did. I also needed to pee. I was trying to work out how to make a run for it, when I realised they weren't even guarding me or whatever, so I walked out. I started running for the tube station (it was night) and the lady came running after me. I think I tripped over or ran into something and they caught me. They took me to this place and made me stay outside. It was fenced off and guarded by this one dude. The lady, who was now Jeb, told him to not let me through. I was crying and saying let me out and he started crying but wouldn't budge and said he had to follow orders. The only thing outside was one of those small rectangle plastic bin things, so I grabbed that to use as a pillow and curled up, trying to sleep. Then the guard was talking to another guy, so I got up and slipped out and he gave me a look like he'd done it on purpose. I ran, and they didn't follow. I got to the tube station and you had to scan the Oyster card and then your ID. Another guy was having problems with it, but it finally worked. I did mine but my ID said 'CONNED', and I realised they tricked me with a new licence thing. I had another one in a pocket, so I used that. I ran to the elevator and a fat guy was behind me so I tried to keep it open but he just stood there, so I went in. I ran to the first train I saw but I didn't recognise the next stop and realised I had taken the wrong line (a lady said it was the ""Green"" line). I got out and tried to work out where to go.

It stopped by itself on the steep grade. We went up part of the way, then we decided it was not worth it because if we slipped, we could fall all the way to the bottom.

It was all white. One of the tall white walls was to be used for projection. I knew that even if we could figure out a way to afford the rent we could not afford to furnish it properly.

"It seemed there is a woman in our kitchen. (I'm sure it isn't Mary, but I wonder). She is standing by the portable dishwasher, which is connected to the sink by a hose. Suddenly the lights go out. There are several light fixtures in the kitchen. One is on the wall over the sink, another is on the opposite wall, and there are others elsewhere in the room. They are in the style of old-time lanterns and some look like candles. I am frightened by the lights flickering on and off, but don't know why this frightens me. When the lights are on, they give off only a dim light. A small child is running about (in what appears to be our apartment). I am lying in bed (sleeping?) but unable to move.

"I was living in my condo. There was a group of about six other women that I knew from the neighborhood. Susan J was one of them. The rest of them I can't identify as women I know in waking life. They had spread out a big blanket very near my front door. It almost seems as though it was directly in front of my front door. They were having a pitch-in picnic. I went out the front door and saw them all sitting there. One of them said something about not being able to get in touch with me. I think they said they sent me an email and I hadn't responded. I told them I had been on vacation for the last ten days and had not been checking my email. So I didn't know about it. But that was okay. Then we were all inside and talking about various things. It seems like my house is just it seems like they had been in my house. The living room in particular was in complete disarray. All of the cushions were off of the sofa. One of the women's daughters had a birthday I think. So there were a lot of gift bags. small, little, girly gift bags. They had things like princesses and Disney characters. female Disney characters like Belle from Beauty and the Beast. I was trying to get my house back in order. Put the cushions back on the sofa. I kept moving these bags around from one spot to another to get them out of the way. While I was doing it, I was looking at Susan J and noticing how much weight she had lost. She was really thin. maybe a size 8. I've never seen Susan J thin. I said something to her about her weight loss and how good she looked. She said something about it being mostly because she had been sick. I thought to myself that as much as I want to lose weight and be thin again I don't want to do it by being sick. I looked at her again once or twice and realized that from the waist down she was still the same size that she had been. We were talking and she gave me a hug. She said the two of us need to spend a girl's weekend together. I said that would be really great, that I would really enjoy that. We continued doing something. I thought what would be really great would be to spend a weekend at a spa and just be pampered all weekend with massages, manicures, pedicures, facials, etc. I told her that I had the perfect idea for our girls weekend. There were other people around so I didn't want to say anything else right then. Plus, I hadn't thought enough about it to be able to suggest a specific place that would be affordable. I knew there was a place in town and it could still be a weekend getaway if we stayed there. As soon as I had a chance and was getting ready to tell her and she pulled out a brochure that was about day spas. One of them was in town. She said, here's what we should do for the weekend. I was so excited that she had the same idea. I said, yeah. And we could get a hotel room so it would still feel like a weekend getaway. get away from phones and TV's and computers and everything.",Positive
"I dreamed I was the guard at a railroad control post. I was controlling the night trains in a well lit post, which was small. In front of me, across from the railroad tracks, were the main offices where the station master was. He was a person of about my size, about 5'6"", and approximately 47 years old. He was working in his office when suddenly a cargo train with a few cars appeared. It stopped so abruptly that there was nothing we could do. We were surprised, he by a person of his size and age and I by a lady. I could make out her face. It was a person I know who works with me sometimes and whom I see for work purposes constantly. She must be about 28, older than me, because I am 25. Her sudden presence confused me and there was nothing I could do, not even defend myself, because she had a fire arm, a pistol, and she told me to get up against the wall. Then the man who worked with me helped me to disarm her. It was in that struggle that I woke up.",Negative

There were 3 girls and a guy and then we saw more, so we gave up. Later, Benjamin and I were in bed which was just a mattress on the floor.

"I had a dream that my family and I were all going somewhere, but I can't remember where it was or why we were all there. My mother and I wanted to go home early, so we took one of the cars. We were at a rest stop, when I realized that we had somehow taken both cars, but I hadn't been driving. My mother said she had been driving each car in shifts, because they were both some kind of new stick shift I didn't know how to drive yet. I was also dreaming about floating down some river with other RAs, and that was our mid-year training. Later, Gage and I were talking, and he was telling me about how every couple in our grade was breaking up before graduation. I was shocked, but really relieved that I wouldn't have that same problem.",Negative
"This dream may be related to the previous one.  My wife Bonita and I were in either a house or a store, and two women were on a mezzanine which was more like the overhead storage space in Mother's garage, except that it had stairs coming down in front.  The women were apparently stealing things, but openly.  I think they had guns.  I picked up some baseball bats one at a time and threw them at them while they were in the upper area, hoping desperately to hit them on the first try so that they couldn't retaliate,  I missed on three tries, but they didn't seem to pay any attention to me.  So when they came down again I bashed first one and then the other with all my might.  To my horror it was just like hitting a tree trunk-just a little give, a little bounce, and no effect.  I yelled this chilling discovery to Bonita, and the women started advancing on me.  One of them opened her mouth, and a short, sharp fang glistened in each corner.  [At that point I woke up, moaning loudly.  I pulled the covers up around my shoulder and drew closer to Bonita.]",Negative

"This dream is a flashback and it seems to take place in a hotel room in which is sitting an older man and a younger woman. The older man is me and the younger woman, I believe, is enamoured of me. The topic of conversation is the Coconut Grove Playhouse with which I was familiar many, many years ago, according to the dream, back in the year of its inception. And the specific topic of conversation is a particular performer at the Coconut Grove Playhouse when I was there. In other words, this dream was taking place, I believe, somewhere in the east and somehow seeming that I have not visited the area in which the Coconut Grove Playhouse is located for many years. And the particular performer at the playhouse was a beautiful young girl who died shortly thereafter under mysterious circumstances. And it was a bit of a sensation at the time because she was quite young and she was also a good performer. It strikes me that the playbill featured her in a bathing suit of some sort and under that was listed her name, and I see this playbill as it appeared in the showcase at the Grove Playhouse. Listed is the girl's name and next to it is her known former chief preoccupation, or occupation, or environment is school in quotation marks. And this particular little tiny piece of information which has her name and the word ""school"" next to it is in gold leaf. Well, the conversation continued and my girl friend that was with me asked me about the death of this girl, and I said I really didn't know anything about it. And she said, ""But your name was implicated at the time."" And she said that is it true or something like that, that this girl died and shortly after that her father died and then her mother died. And I believe I made some kind of a comment like, ""When they go, they go big."" And my girl friend said, ""It was such a shame that there was nobody even there afterwards to remember her."" And I think I repeated the statement I had just made. I believe there was another part to this dream in which I may have been actually somehow involved with the Coconut Grove Playhouse. In regard to the time sequence of this dream, the scene that is taking place in the hotel somewhere in the east, is about 20 to 25 years after the incident that happened at the Coconut Grove Playhouse that is being discussed. And the girl friend that I'm with strikes me as somewhat of a sex kitten type. And I seem to be in my 50's and much heavier. And even though this girl is young enough to be my daughter, I don't really think of her that way. Her interest in this girl who was a performer seems to derive from the notion that she identifies to an extent with her because of her youth. In other words, they were both about the same age when I was involved with them or seemingly involved with them, and they were both attractive. In the word ""school"" that appears under the playbill, there -- the quotation marks are somewhat exaggerated and the one to the left of the word is as it should be, but the one to the right of the word, instead of being place in its proper position, is placed with -- near the bottom of the word rather than near the top. And this set of quotation marks has the tail at the top so that the top of the tail is just about even with the bottom of the letters of the word ""school."" This is the only unusual feature in the dream. The day residue for this dream: I just saw a picture of a girl in a bathing suit today, that is well known to me. The girl, that is, not the bathing suit. The male, the character, well, me in the dream, the person I was, I seemed to remind me to some extent of my father's uncle who passed away many years ago, but who was a -- he was a bit of a man about town and his years did not seem to impede his sexual prowess or his behavior or the age of the girls with whom he went out at all. And in the dream I kind of felt like him. The feeling that bothers me is that there was about him a slight air of deception.",Positive

That place was half-familiar since I saw my own kitchen and those corridors, but I got to Mexico using some tickets that had been given to us).

This woman is dressed in as a knee, like knickers and very fancy clothes and is pointing out various things to this group. I'm off on the side and Audrey is there. It turns out that this is really my speech, but that she's giving it. It turns out that this is the custom in these times. Nobody gives their own speech. They always have some kind of a stand-in. It's like a pen name except with regard to lecturing. It turns out she's talking about my scoring system. Audrey is there with me, and I'm pointing out to her some of the nuances of this scoring system that the old battleaxe is talking about. Somebody else is there like maybe my father-in-law, Max. He's getting a big bang out of this and Audrey is pointing out an inconsistency. One of the categories doesn't seem to quite fit.

Earlier was angry at Frank for almost causing a fire when clothes stuffed in a closet started to smolder. Later I climb up high, to a wobbly bookcase, and almost fall down. (awakened)",Positive
"I was at work, involved in my usual work when a woman who is involved in the United Way campaign with me, who would really be my supervisor, came down and asked me if I had been counting the coupons. I said ""No, there's no urgency top it at this point, we still have plenty of time."" And she said ""Oh yes, there certainly is urgency."" And she went to my desk and ripped open my drawer and grabbed those coupons out of there and started to count them. I got all upset and that was it.",Negative
"I'm with a woman and her son (or daughter) who is aged about 12. We have the task of doing a 'stock take' in a large rambling empty multi-storey factory or warehouse. It is like a disused victorian factory that has been converted into a warehouse - with storage shelves lining the walls. To get from one floor to the next you have to climb up ladders, or in some cases, just pull yourself up through a hatch. The stock we are supposed to be counting is large jars or packets of jam or dried milk or something. I have to estimate how many packets there are, because we don't have time to count them. We also don't have pen and paper so I have to keep the numbers in my head - an almost impossible task.",Positive
"Hole in Rusty's Canoe  I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson in the Big Resort Area. We have two canoes: one is my uncle Rusty Redding's, and the other may be Kevin's canoe or his friend's canoe. Four people approach with a bunk-type bed: a man, a woman, a child, and our friend Bubba Hacker. From a distance I at first don't recognize Bubba, but then I do and I wonder what the hell he's doing with a huge bed in the Big Resort Area. They get closer and Bubba moves away from the people, towards us, as a way of saying that he was just joking about being with them and bringing the big bed. Kevin and I push off in Rusty's canoe. There is three inches of water in the bottom of it. I say there must be a hole in it, and I see it, bubbling, on the keel near the stern. I tell to Kevin and Bubba to put all the gear in the other canoe, and let me take the leaky canoe by myself. Kevin and I had been fishing. We all see a bald eagle. I point it out. The man, woman, and child see it too. I take two photographs of it while it is flying. I don't know if they'll turn out because the camera is moving. We are headed to the 100-rod Evergreen Lake portage. We are on the south side of Oval Island on the west end. I think of the tough paddle across open water I'll have alone in a canoe.",Negative
"(11/06/01)[""Stampeding sheep.""] I am outdoors. I see lots of animals stampeding toward me. I am carrying a small baby boy with me. I run to a building and go inside, although it's like a bombed out building. I run up the stairs which has piles of sand on it. The sheep are coming up the stairs at me and the boy. I shove and kick the sand in their faces, trying to slow them down. It works. They turn and go back down the stairs. I was on the verge of rounding a corner to the second flight of stairs but don't have to now.",Negative

"I meet with two judges of my poetry contest, Erik and some other guy (Lewis?). I tell them, ""I have one hour and then my rehearsal group comes by, so let's get to work and choose the winner."" They agree and then Erik starts making funny faces and acting goofy. He hides and plays in my writing office. Lewis and I keep trying to talk him into seriousing up. Then my rehearsal group arrives. Some woman like Mabel really wants my attention. I try to pay attention to both groups. I see a list of author's names and see Dammitt and Akin. I then check the newsletter to see if they are the same as the winners. They are. Lucy comes in and wants to tell me all about the fact that when she falls asleep she acts like a little girl and either masturbates or gets sexually excited and now she's afraid to go to sleep. She rolls across the floor, looking like a little girl with Merle's condition. I half listen to her.",Positive
"Death Boy  I'm with my classmate Annette Trantor and a man, who I later know to by my roommate Jack Thigpen, in a room. It's night. Annette is then my classmate Virginia Hamms. We talk about Bob Mould. The woman, who is Annette at this point, says there is a selected dance/ska band playing after Bob Mould. My friend Tim Zelling wants a Bosstones ticket for this coming Tuesday's show. There are bunk beds there with six inches of space between the mattress and the frame, and nothing in between. A man from Brimson we call Death Boy walks up some stairs. He sits down across the table from me. I'm scared. I tell him my friends call him Death Boy and he laughs. I feel more at ease then. Two men who are 30 or 40 years old come in. One starts to tell a dream of eating green and brown spinach in different proportions. The other man interrupts with a dream of his own, and doesn't listen to his friend's dream. Virginia writes down 10 phone numbers that someone, either Death Boy or one of the men, says. She leaves. The men stay and talk.",Negative

"Ezra, Ramona, Tiana, some guy I made up and I were doing this thing and we had to defeat people to get out. The first two were creepy things -- skeleton blokes and stuff. We walked through these woods to get to the next place and some creepy people followed us. I was wearing my light blue ""MB"" shorts and the blue top with brown sleeves and had been for the last few days. We got to the next arena place and we had to defeat John Travolta. The other guy (call him Joe) started fighting him and they both had some cool moves. Joe won and I picked him up and kissed him, saying he was the man (all friendly stuff) for beating John Travolta. The next two ""Gods"" were a face of a lady in a square box (who Ezra talked to and that's what you had to do, because she was lonely and then she left) and the last one was the ""oracle"" (who was a face of a lady too). But when Ezra got there, we told him the whole thing was a joke. Then we were at some creepy China town place. They had little animals, and one tried to escape. I cuddled some cute animal. We had to get special cards from a lady to go places. We talked about getting costumes for the quest thing and John Travolta had said to get good escape gear and I wanted to go home to get my shoes. Tiana dressed up and Ramona called her mother.",Positive

One of them was not loyal and tried to rebel, shoots at me with a bow, and then there's a whole series of actions where I'm chasing her around, and performing various acts that are aggressive and sexual at the same time, mainly sexual.

"Reading about a nudist colony in Arizona, being told about it, wondering if it had any connection with peyote ceremonies. I and some woman were going to visit it; we got there, and wandered around for a while -- they grew a lot of different vegetables and flowers. Then I saw everyone had on sort of smocks, and I discovered that they had put them on so as not to offend me, because I wasn't mature enough to be there, which insulted me and yet at the same time, made me doubt if I was. Finally the head of the colony came up to me, a little man, and explained to me that I was partly mature and partly not, and having conflicts now, but I should try to be mature or else I wouldn't be -- if I didn't take off my clothes on the first day, I never would. Everyone was gathered around me -- all dressed -- waiting to see what I would do; I was now with my husband who also was urging me to do this. We went to a place where there were many different sized sinks filled with water; one fairly large one I decided to use, and started to undress. I got undressed, not particularly embarrassed, and got into the sink, which was large enough to sit in. I sat there relaxing, and wondered why no one else had taken off their clothes -- they were in various stages of undress or fully clothed; my husband had on swimming trunks and a shirt and was talking to someone and making no move to undress. It was strange.",Negative

"A man is riding around in a red Thunderbird, apparently looking for an enemy who lives in New York City. He has the address written down on a piece of paper. With him is a little girl and he is anxious for her safety. It is nighttime. He stops near a house and places her in a crate standing up high near a window and hidden. On other side of window one can see another little girl sleeping. She is about same age and sleeps on her back and is wearing a false nose. The man drives away and tries to remember the address. He takes long knife from seat and places in pocket and also puts a long bayonet-like tool in his belt. Then fishes out piece of paper and looks at address. Sees that it is East and he is heading in wrong direction. He turns into an apartment-hotel driveway and turns around, heading East. Next the two girls are seen inside the house, the one who was sleeping leading the other thru the rooms.",Negative
"Entered a small store to buy a ""Washington Star"" newspaper. The room was narrow, with a glass show case in front of which were 2 or 3 boxes, each with a small pile of newspapers. It was about 8 p.m., and I hardly expected to find any ""Star"" left -- none of the papers on the boxes were ""Stars."" I debated whether to ask ""Have you any 'Stars' left?"" (There was a man behind the show case) or to assume a ""Star"" was probably ""salted away"" somewhere and simply say ""I want a Washington Star"" I decided on the latter method of approach, as I had a superstitious feeling that the former would greatly lessen the chances that any copy of the paper would be available. The proprietor then stood with a copy of the ""Star"" in his hands, leafing it over backward and forward (as Pearl does with a book he is about to set a price on) as if loath to part with it. The proprietor's partner had written, in pencil, on a margin of the paper ""Aren't there some copies of the 'Star' out on loan?"" This seemed to be the case and in view of the likelihood of the return of some of these loaned copies, I was able to convince the owner that he should sell me this copy.",Negative

"Magical grandparents look like ordinary older people, but they are really magical godparents, but cast under a spell. I come to their house and they show me around. We go out into the backyard and walk. I start singing because it is so beautiful and I sing beautifully. I sing, ""Oh, Lord, look at these beautiful mountains."" We walk across the yard, which is iced over rain water, and I'm worried it will crack and we'll fall through. She says, ""No, no problem."" We safely get to the other side. There is a sort of children's fantasy playground there and I go in and look around at the cute playhouses and things. The older woman gives me a huge pink crystal on a necklace and I wear it. As I'm going through the playground, it changes to a deep ruby color and I find a big black crystal that pops up out of a ""playhouse."" That means the spell is broken and they are restored to their magical selves.",Negative

I parked my car and could hear sirens and I called out ""Ryan!"" and Ryan Kwanten and Rutina Wesley were on the balcony and he called back to me. I said we had to go -- the cops were coming for him.

"It was 9:00 in the evening, and my kitten was playing with a solution of some sort. Mom and I were going out that night so we just went and when we came back no lights were on, and my cat was invisible. Well, not really. She was just misty, and glow-in-the-dark. Then when we put her in her room, we found she was out again. But it was actually that she multiplied. So we gathered up all of the kittens and then put her in her room. Setting: Home. Characters: My mom, me, my cat. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I thought it was really weird 'cause normal cats don't multiply and glow in the dark.",Positive
"I'm at Warrior - it is dinnertime, and I've been staying in this other room, finishing something - we were all sitting in our chairs, and something was happening at the very end that I didn't finish. So instead of staying to finish that, I'm now coming into the room where everything is out on the tables - it's a long table with picnic-sort-of benches along it. There's a number of us (certainly not as many as there were at Warrior last year), and everyone else has been eating for a while. I'm rather concerned about getting enough to eat. I go around the table with this dish that I have [picked up or been handed, I don't know which] - everybody was taking something with them that they'd been handed by the cook or somebody. This was vegetable-puff things, or little bitty things that look ""grassy"" - definitely an attractive arrangement on the oblong dish, but it looked like sort of tufts of grass, which was not particularly appealing. I take it around the table with me, glancing at the other dishes as I go and think there's not much left, put my dish down and I'm talking to someone down at the end there - we get involved in talking about something and it's still a little while before I get to put anything on my plate. I go down to the other end of the table and pick up a dish or 2, sort of scrape what's left on it together and get some meal-for-me. Most everyone else has already left, it's just me and a few other people. Now we're going into another room, with Brad, and I am feeling very guilty, apprehensive, that Brad is going to find me out. He will know that I haven't managed my time very well and this is the result of it: I have not gotten myself fed because of my own indulgences. I'm very concerned about that. He's talking. There's a clump of us at one end of the room and it's almost as though we're lying down; not quite. Jenny's right next to me, and Brad is talking about something, and his voice fades out, a little now and then - I'm almost ready to say, ""I can't hear"", but I hesitate. Then I hear Jenny say - and not very loud or strong either - ""John, I can't hear"", and I repeat, almost with her, ""John, I can't hear you"", which, as soon as I say it I realize isn't quite the way we're ""sposed to say it"" - I should say, (firmly) ""John, I can't hear!"" and stick my hand up, very clearly. I also realize right after that it's not John, it's Brad - and we both said John. An interesting situation, I don't know quite what to make of that, but Brad doesn't say anything about it (at least not before I'm out of that scene).",Negative
"I was a teacher of some sort, with a bunch of little kids, waiting for a ride out in the rain. It started to really come down. The children gathered closely, then we walked into a house. There I remember taking off my shoes and walking into the basement of the house. I laid in a bed and my girl friend was also in the bed. We were listening to a band that in real life we both like, and then she left. I looked all around the basement for her, and when I walked to the bottom of the stairs, a glare came through the window at the top, and then she was standing on the stairs.",Positive
"Running Over People  My sister Ramona and I are in a boat fishing. We drift into shallow water. I'm going to pull up the 25 horsepower motor and put down the trolling motor. We move, and are in a very rocky area that goes from very shallow to very deep. It's quarry-like, and the water has a reddish tint. We go through a narrow channel. I use the trolling motor. I see a tree ahead of us with bald eagles in it. There are three larger figures on the tree. They move as if to capture or kill the eagles. They have a huge red flag on a pole about 20 feet long. We get closer. One man is standing in front of the other man on the water. The man speaks to us. He has a weapon and tries to make us stop. I won't stop: I start the 25 horsepower motor and go full throttle, steering straight for them. They say they need help. I run them over, and they dart out of the way. I turn and go back again. The man who was alone grabs the side of the boat as I speed past. He climbs in the boat. I use a fishing net to hit him in the glasses to get him to fall out of the boat.",Negative

"I was in Human Bio, but it was different. Felipe was in front of me and Aliyah was next to me. I was in the third row (there were five rows). At the end of the class, Felipe said he wanted to ask Aliyah to a dance but couldn't afford a dancer. Then he said instead of asking the 'pretty girls', he should ask the ugly ones. I thought 'here we go' and he said ""Hello"", obviously pretending to ask me (and he was being mean, not joking). We got given a new experiment, at first it was already filled out but then it was new. I started going on about everyone being shallow, but he just walked off. Aliyah waited for me in the hall outside and we walked together. She went into a room and then two people were talking. She went behind this bookshelf (which was sticking out in the middle of the room, and there was a hidden space behind it). She sat in this thing in front of the wall and there was a hole behind it. It was small and she went through it as a shortcut out. There was no way I could fit, so I left and went out the front door (the place was like a mansion). There were thin wires all over the lawn (which was huge) and so I was jumping over them. Then there was garden bed and I crawled through it to the path. I realized I had forgotten my shoes. I had to cross the road for the bus and I was thinking I should call Mom to get me.",Positive
"It was a place which looked very much like the school I go to, first in a place where there was a stepladder and stairs going up to the second floor. Everything was painted white (the walls), the stepladder was dirty, and the stairs going to the second floor were painted green, but old and discolored; a door and a window on each side, dirty planks, etc. There was a woman who was trying on dresses. It was like a fashion show, but the place didn't seem appropriate; I observed this. There was a man of about 35 who was talking to a group of boys of about 10 to 17 years. Then it was another place. It was a classroom in school, very similar to the previous setting. In class we were talking to the teacher (I do know her and she teaches me Family Education, she is about 38) and I recognized several classmates. We were talking about dresses, materials and patterns, since we wanted to make them. I described a dress in a white material, with a zipper in the front and  a collar, sleeveless and with colored pockets. I said it was a dress for the beach. The people I recognized were the teacher and 2 or 3 classmates of about 15 or 16 years.",Positive

I was shopping with my friend (male--age 23). We were standing in front of a store. He was giving me some money so I could go in a grocery store to buy a few things (can't recall what). He remarked that we should both try not to spend so much of his money I was rather surprised. I went into the store but could not bring myself to spend any of his money. So I went out of the store. In order to reach the sidewalk I had to walk through a field of weeds and high grass. When I reached the walk I saw that the parking meter for the space we had parked in was not registering.

"We had gone to this place for an excursion before and it had been built in the early 2000's. It was in the middle of being built and it was underwater (not of all it). The first time we went there we were lining up and in another queue were celebrities, I remember seeing Adam Baldwin and Matt Damon and Tom Welling was in a car. The second time we went, I didn't notice anyone I knew. Mr Billings got some of us to go down to these seats. Elijah, someone else and I went and sat down. Darius made a stupid pose. Calvin and I were then sitting somewhere. Later when we went back, Tiana and some others were sitting in front. Some chocolate fell and they were going to steal it, but I got it back. There was another seating section and Eugene was sitting there, but if I sat near him it was too obvious why I was sitting there. Rodney came and sat near us at the front.

"This girl had taken a photo of her family and some famous people, including Deborah Kara Unger, in some setting. Something to do with this caused her to get an unlimited supply of drugs from Bob (Seth Rogen in Dawson's Creek). She decided to go get some, but then it was different and he was actually stalking her or something. He ended up chasing her on a bike. Then she was like his half sister or something. She went to a college or something and his full sister went there and looked exactly like her. She went to her room and locked herself in. He tried to get through the window (it was on the second floor or so). Then he was Charlie and she was Dee (both from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia). She was going to help him through and then she saw his sister sitting across from the window (it was like an alley just outside her window, and she was sitting on the wall across from the window). She climbed down and there were bags of alcohol, onions and bread. She climbed up with some alcohol to join her. She said she was leaving and something I can't read.

"I was at University which was different. I got Dad to bring me his laptop as he was nearby. The carpark was undercover. We went to the car. There was something about a 'crush' and it had something to do with Chris Barrie photos on my computer. A guy and a girl were near me and they had bright blue eyes and were pale. They said they were vampires and they showed their fangs. I told Dad and he was like 'whatever' but eventually he looked at them and realised. We went to leave. I wondered why no-one had known of vampires before then. We drove off and saw all these people running down the street followed by heaps of creatures. There were giant dogs, ogres (like in World of Warcraft), clouds etc. Some then decided to come our way. Then we were on foot and we ran. There were creatures everywhere. We were with some others. There was a ladder on a wall which was hard to climb and this female creature was following us easily. We got to the ground and ran. There was a big meeting on the oval for the creatures. We got past them and then suddenly there were no creatures. There were some little rooms so we went in one. We shut the doors but the windows had no glass. We got talking and realized that none of us had had sex before. One of the girl's was a 'popular' girl. We wondered why that would matter. One of us asked ""why is sex always a bad thing?"". Then we realized all the creatures were staring in at us. We ran. Later, it was shown that a moth had flown into the room, which supposedly made us visible because it had mated before. We got caught. They impregnated us with random guys. Tara from True Blood got impregnated by Eggs (True Blood). Sookie (True Blood) was impregnated with Sam (True Blood). This other girl liked Eggs and complained. There was this thing about Sam Trammell, which was Wikipedia like. The photos of him made him look gay. It said he was gay and also used to be a teacher. I don't know if it was true though.",Negative

Her mother came and we moved again. Something happened to the movie and it skipped to the end. People in astronaut like suits came in and they shut the doors.

"I am driving my blue MG down a street in St. Petersburg, Fla. Someone has said there is a job open at Sears and I am trying to get there. Ahead of me are some soldiers marching and I put on the brakes, but slip toward them and actually bump slightly several men in the back rank. But they don't seem to mind and just turn and look at me slightly. Then I drive on and we all reach a cross street at the same time and must wait. For some reason I am squatting alongside the front rank and looking ahead and then I drop a handful of dust alongside a soldier and it gets into his eye. I quickly apologize and get in car and drive on.",Positive
"Mason Alarm  I am in Mason Cafeteria at Brimson. My friend Brittany Johnson is sitting at a table trying to raise money for someone's grandma named Karla, who has died. I am picking up change on the floor (pennies, dimes, nickels, and quarters) and putting them in my pocket. A person I work with at the Brimson Library, name Don, is there. I say that it too bad about grandma Karla. I am upstairs in the cafeteria now. There are escalators instead of stairs. I am at the top of the escalator. There is a long line to get food. The big football player who looks like my supervisor from Grocery Getto, Loren Voigt, says something to me about going to the back of the line. I say shit, I don't want to wait! I put my hand on the railing of the escalator and hit an alarm. A buzzing bell goes off. The food server man goes to the panel in the wall with four handles on it. She shuts the alarm off, and then turns on a control alarm. Then he shuts the control alarm off. He turns to the people in line and asks who hit the alarm button. I say it was I: I hit it accidentally, and I'm sorry. He tells me that I'll have to wash the dishes in the cafeteria on the weekend. I tell him I don't even work in Mason! He doesn't care. He gets mad and squirts me with some Palmolive dishwashing soap. I go down the escalator. At the bottom are two Brimson security guards. They are talking. One is holding deodorant. I tell them I have been verbally harassed and assaulted. I ask them what my options are, concerning what to do now. The director of Mason Cafeteria is talking with the guards. I see someone above me run towards where the incident took place. The person running is a black leader. My friend Queen Billman is there. She was with when the alarm went off. She whispers to me that we should just leave. I don't respond to her. I want to be vindicated. It is concluded that the man who squirted me will do the dishes. I explain that he threatened us by telling us we would have to wash dishes. This person is there. He looks different: he has long dark hair, and is not wearing a bandana. He is wearing an apron and his shirt is wet. Queen was also squirted. We leave. I think I'll eat somewhere else tonight. Queen runs and grabs some fruit snacks in a purple package that are on the table of a booth. She hops on a skateboard and skates to her room. I wonder if she is coming back. It seems like it. I walk back to the dorms.",Negative
"I was walking along the street with a friend when we came to a movie house which had been made over and was now used for church meetings.

Then I began to wonder why he died, for death resulting from complications arising from a simple arm wound seemed very strange. Then I woke.",Positive
"I awaken from a nap and reach out to fetch my eyeglasses from a nearby table. Something is wrong with one of the lenses -- the left one. The part of the lens near the nosepiece has become very thin and has begun to peel away as if made of tranparent paper. I touch it there and more of the lens flakes away. Very soon the flaking ceases and about half of the left lens is gone, leaving a large hole in the glass. I put the glasses on my face and think to myself, ""It looks like the damage has stopped. At least I can still use them."" The dream ends with a feeling of making due with what I have despite setbacks.",Negative

He shyly reaches out to hold my hand, but doesn't finish the gesture because he doesn't know how to react to my deformed hand. I hold it out for him to hold and he does so. The audience watches, enjoying the scene. Then he sings a magnificent opera to a large woman on my left. The audience agrees it's his best song.

After awhile, I notice that there is a white mist in the room and I realize that the kitten has put the gas pellet in my room. Coughing, we escape outside.

"I was leaving this shopping center to go home and noticed that someone had built this very tall and very, very long blue fence. There was a subdivision on the other side but I didn't know how to get around the fence to get home as the fence seemed to be a mile or more long. I didn't see the end of the fence. Maybe that's why I though I couldn't get around it. I decided to just fly over the fence to get home. Even after I flew over the fence, I couldn't find my house. I was in this neighborhood and I was driving along these sidewalks between the houses-kind of like the sidewalks behind the apartments here. People and children were running to get out of my way.

In my dream there was a girl at my level, or a bit above, who played Twinkle by herself, and then my other friends and I played duets but completely messed up. (This part didn't happen in real life.) Setting: It was on the stage: the same one from last night for real. Characters: There were all of my violin student friends. A group of girls who I play music with and goof off with. Some are a little bit spacey, but I still have fun with them. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, confused. I'm sort of wondering about it, because I know I did well in the real concert.

"I bought a new home and the walls seemed to be built out of line. I noticed the other homes were being rebuilt or repaired on account of the uneven walls. I got down close to the ground and took a good look at the foundation bricks. I sighted the walls from one end to another. I was standing on a pile where there was a little fire. Thee were rags on it also. Gramp was below. I threw down some paper for him to start a fire. We were like on a mountain top. I was trying to write a theme or poem in the cafeteria in white. Ann was lying on the pile sleeping like in a bed. I looked at the time in New York and it was 5:45 and my watch was 7:00 p.m. That was Big City time. I went to see Dr. Allen. I found him at a party. The nurse was boiling potatoes; then she made rice. Dr. Allen was eating some. Dr. Allen checked me, and he made a diagram of some organ.",Positive
"The dream involved these people tearing this house down. It seems they were going to tear it down to rebuild it across the road. It didn't make a whole lot of sense. They were starting it in a very odd way. They were tearing down the foundation first and leaving most of the house still standing up. It would seem to be a rather dangerous procedure because the rest of the house, pieces of it would collapse and onto them. I and this girl and this big Negro man were most concerned with getting the house torn down. A whole lot of people had come out presumably to help. It seemed like sort of an old-fashioned thing with everyone pitching in, all your friends and neighbors to help you put up a house or something. These people were all friends and neighbors of whoever this house belonged to. It was Sunday afternoon and they all brought all sorts of fruit and everything. They were just sitting there having a big picnic while we were trying to get the house torn down, and I didn't think it was right that they wouldn't help. We were trying to get them to do so, but they wouldn't do it.",Negative

"I was in this dime store looking around and perhaps buy something, but at any rate I was looking around. I was looking at pocketbooks and seeing if they had any I liked. I did see one that I liked fairly well, but I didn't have my pocket book with me. So there was this big woman, utterly, utterly different from me in every way, who also thought this was a lovely pocketbook. I thought this was sort of a collegiate pocketbook. It was leather and madras or something, but she thought it was the perfect pocketbook for her to go to church with and such like things. I think, as a matter of fact, that this pocketbook sort of changed its nature. It was more of a patent leather thing. But at any rate, I was afraid she would get it and I was trying to see if it had any serial number or anything on it so maybe they could get another one for me if I wanted it. I was just wandering around the dime store and looking at some potted plants. By this time my husband came in from somewhere. We were going to buy some and I don't know why because this is something we would never buy, but we couldn't pay the price that they were asking for these plants and I forget even what kind they were. Probably in my dream I really didn't know either. Now that I think of it, the leaves of one of these plants looked like chrysanthemum leaves. The other plant looked more like this philodendron. So I went carefully, more or less carefully, not to damage the plants, and also to find some good leaves, picked off 3 leaves, 2 of the chrysanthemum type and one of the philodendron, and took them to the store manager and he was going to root them for us. And if it worked, we were going to pay a certain amount, and if it didn't work, then we didn't have to pay anything for them.",Negative

"Neighbor's Noise Complaint  I'm at home in Oak Valley having a party with my brother Wally. My cousin Archie Weber and friends Stephen Ramos, Barb Flanders, and Jill Banks are there.

It's a very relaxed party, with people talking, some outside. It is darker, in the evening. Two phones in the house ring. Wally answers. It is the neighbors calling to complain and threaten us. While he talks I walk out into the yard to have the guests come inside. While I'm doing this, two police officers come and say there are complaints of noise. I go talk to the police. They say the complaints were on public access! One of them asks for a house plan. I'm sober, and confident that we were doing nothing wrong, so I quickly tell him I live here and I'll show him around the house. I show him around, beginning upstairs.

I opened the passenger door and said ""Get out of my car"" and I stuck something pointy into his gut and said ""what did you take?"". He had a sign and a bunch of other stuff. I told him to put it back and get out. He said I couldn't report him to the school because I was in the wrong and I said ""suck my balls nub"".

I went to the shop and we stayed there for a while. There were tents in there. There were collections of stuff. There was some Beatles stuff.

"I dreamed I was in the French building on campus, the language building, and I was going to take some sort of exam that afternoon. And so I went down to some food vending machines that were there to get a bar of candy or something before I went back and studied. And after I had gotten the candy bar, I noticed there was some sort of commotion going on outside the building. I went to the front and looked out, and I saw these people looking, gazing over toward the Bell Tower, in the direction of it. And I saw that there had been a violent windstorm of some sort, probably a tornado, which had caused even the great big water tower (which you could see from where I was, but actually in reality you couldn't) to fall over. And this was very amazing. The whole thing had just toppled over, on its side, or almost on its side. And I went outside. This windstorm had cut sort of a diagonal through campus. There wasn't actually too much damage, except this great, tremendous water tower being overturned. And I went down to a building that was under construction, which would have been, as I was facing the Bell Tower, to the left of the library and about in the parking lot there. But this seemed to be an uptown sort of business district of some sort. And I was standing inside this building, which was unfinished on the inside, just a dirt floor, talking to somebody about the difference between tornadoes and hurricanes. And all of a sudden another little tornado came along. And we were both scared and hid behind this car that was in the building. And the little tornado came in where we were; it was only about 10 or 12 feet high and 4 or 5 inches thick, and it was just a little black round, not even funnel-shaped, with an irregular column. And I remembered something somebody had said one time about if a tornado started heading in one direction, if you headed in an opposite direction, you would probably be safe. And so it went one way and I went another, and got away from it. I wasn't particularly scared of it. I knew if it touched me, it would be pretty bad. And that was about the end of the dream. And I feel this might be significant in some way because I had in the past dreams about tornadoes in which there were great, huge and very terrifying things that were very destructive and very fear-inspiring. I can remember one in particular in which I was in a great building in a city when at the edge of the city across the skyline I could see three huge tornadoes starting to come towards me, and this was a very nightmarish dream. But this one wasn't particularly scary. The tornado was so much smaller. That's all.",Negative

"I am standing, holding a sick boy in my arms. He is a cute tow head boy about 6 years old. He is so sleepy that he curls up in a fetal ball position over my arm as I try and hold him around the waist. Then I pull him gently to standing and he is still sleeping, all draped over my arms. Now I feel some wet and gooey substance on my foot and think he's thrown up on me. But when I look, it is some food he had in his hand, like noodles or something, that fell out of his relaxed hand. I think he's sick and maybe has an ear infection. I carry him to a bed and put him down, covering him up with a sleeping bag. He seems quite willing to lay there and sleep. It's good for him and he knows it. Now there is a windstorm and I am in a rowboat or walking across a raised bar across a large body of water. I cross it to the other side to investigate it. The boy is there and people keep shooing him back for his own safety and yet he must go there for his better health. They don't understand that. So we cross back over the bar and some man is saying the winds are increasing. I wonder if the car we are in will be swept off the bar and into the churning water, but that doesn't happen. We get to the other side.",Negative
"I was putting up a few Christmas decorations on top of a large wooden piece of furniture. It was primarily a wooden sled, not solid wood but rather looked like a frame of sled for lack of a better description; some reindeer and they had lights on them. I offered to put them up for a neighbor as well. He declined because of the time of the year. I thought this was quite odd for me, also. I usually put my tree and decorations up the weekend after Thanksgiving and take them down a day or two after Christmas. I was picking up the newspapers in the yard for two of the neighbors. They had come apart a bit so I was sorting the sections and making sure each neighbor got all the sections they were supposed to. Bev's children were going to spend the weekend with me. It ended up that Rachel S was there 1-2 nights early to spend the night. She was at the top of the steps and asked if she could play Nintendo. I told her it was bedtime. I went up to tuck her back in bed and Bev was there too. She was saying that she needed to head for home. I told her that it was so late, about 11 pm, so I thought she should spend the night and drive home in the morning. Otherwise she would be driving until 1 or 1:30 am. I don't know what she decided to do. Rachel S came downstairs in her pajamas. I picked her up to take her back up to bed. I was noticing that she had gained a lot of weight and I felt bad for her. I was thinking about the difficulty all of my siblings and I have in maintaining our weight. it is a constant battle for all of us. I had taken Rachel S to preschool or something and I went into the room to pick her up after. I had a coffee cup with my name on it. Anna. I sat it down on a shelf with all of the children's cups. I went back in a few minutes later to pick it up and it wasn't there any longer. Someone said they thought they knew where it was and they went to get it. I saw an old friend and we were chatting. I said something about talking with or seeing Susan J. She said she would have liked to see her too. I said that I might arrange that the next time. I went to Mass. There were many people coming in at one time. I wanted to sit in one of the back seats because I knew I had to leave at 9:30 am. I chose one seat and when I knelt down I could not put my legs straight back. As soon as I had the opportunity I got up and moved up a few rows further. Someone was talking to Jerry Lewis about his diet and he showed them a storage room where he kept all of his favorite diet foods. It was a very large room with a high ceiling. It had large, commercial-size containers of everything, like they would have at places that serve food to large groups. I saw large jars of what appeared to be olive pieces for salads. I thought that was a good idea. Something new I could put on my salads. Susan J, Marlene F, and myself were all grocery shopping together. All of the things we were selecting from were these dietary things of Jerry's. I had several bags of potato chips in my cart. I thought this might be a nice change for me if they are good for his diet, they might be good for mine.",Positive
"31 Ram Skis  I'm in Vail, Colorado, with friends, to ski. I'm putting on my ski gear outside by a snow bank where two women are sitting. I have a bottle of Captain Morgan rum in my left pocket. The pocket has a hole in it. I take the rum out and put it in my right pocket. I see my right pocket has a hole in it too. The holes are so big the bottle easily slips out. I get ""31 Ram"" skis, my brother Wally tells me when I go into the ski rental shop. They are for skiing tracks. There are some garbage bins there. Others and I are supposed to take the bins somewhere, fill them up, and bring them back. I walk over with my bin to fill it. The guy from who I am supposed to fill my bin has an empty bin. He may be a Brimson student I know from intramural basketball. I fill my bin up at the place and I dump it.",Positive
"I'm in a budget supermarket. It's a strange one. Not many customers. Products are set out sparingly on small islands. Loads of staff stationed at different tills are dotted around the store. It is brightly colored, like the set of a children's' tv show. I'm there to buy provisions for some sort of project. The problem is, I already have a trolley load of stuff that I bought in another store. The stuff isn't food - rather various pieces of hardware. Bizarrely, at the checkout, when I explain I have a trolley mostly full of stuff i'd already paid for in another store, the checkout lady says she still has to put it through her till. The bar codes are still there, and apparently she is going to charge me for this stuff again. I suddenly occurs to me that I must be completely stupid, and I wake up.",Negative
"I'm in a play. I'm playing a male part. I have fake whiskers glued on. I am playing ""The King of Israel."" I walk to the stage area and stand on an empty stage. I know the throne is there, but I just can't see it. I'm waiting for the audience to be seated. A chorus is singing on bleachers between me and the audience. Open bleachers are near me at the front of the stage. Some people sit there in case I fall. I pace and then decide to start. I announce, ""I am the King of Israel"" and I place myself on the throne. Someone playing God's angel comes in and says, ""God didn't say you could do that,"" and I said, ""But I know He will"" The play goes on. I worry if my false whiskers are going to fall off.",Negative
"I had not been able to check my computer because some messages were from the future--from people from the past. A message was there from 19B Chestnut St. I knew this meant Nanny and Grandfather's house. They died long ago--but the message from them was in the future. Dora had no address to list her from, so I could not open the file. It was from a different place in time. A whole different dimension. When I tried to understand it--I could hear the circumference of individual letters rather than hear/see the words--the whirring of the vibrations from the shapes of the letters. Moonlight. Dora's message was there but had not happened yet. Eileen's message I wanted to open very bad. I could not open it because a map of the U.S.--the whirring of moving letters--spinning. The machine would not let me see, yet, a message from another time. It was locked away until the time had come. I was getting a list of important messages I could not see because they were not from places I could understand. It was another dimension.",Positive
"I walked into the women's dressing room at the Tae Kwon Do studio, even though I have never been in there before. When I opened the door, there was a guy from my psychology class(who I don't know) inside changing. He apologized for being in the women's dressing room. I told him it wasn't a big deal and that I accidentally was in there too. We looked outside the door, on the base of the wall. There was one of those shoe store mirrors that are at angles. It was set up so you could see under the door from outside the changing room. The guy told me to pull down my pants and put my butt against the door, which was the kind of store changing rooms with the panels that allow you to partially see through. I stuck my butt against the door and looked between my legs and under the door, at the mirror. I could see the impression of my bare ass through the door. I pulled up my pants and the guy and I were amused, but concerned that people could spy on us.",Negative
"A very vivid dream about either my friend Terry or my brother becoming king of England. The scene is set for the inauguration ceremony dinner. There is a huge hall with a high stage where the king and his closest colleagues sits (I am among them). Below is a sea of decorated tables of unknown posh guests. The people mostly seem to be young, as if friends of a bride and groom, although they all seem upper class (so they wouldn't be my friends). For the rest of the dream I'm in the palace the day after as the right-hand-man of the king. The king's identity keeps flipping. Now he is another friend of mine, my friend Toby. In one room in the palace is a huge pool table, where we organize a tournament. My mother is there with her partner, who also has an adult son with him. I remember meeting the ex-queen, who is a young upper class lady, who's wearing an expensive dress, hair-do and make-up, and seems to look down on us. She doesn't seem to approve of the new king and his entourage. There's another part of the dream which is set in a wine-making room, which is like a James Bond set: the walls are stainless steel, the floor is deep with white wine, and there's a walkway or ledge above the surface of the wine. Vine roots trail downwards from the ceiling out of view into the wine. Either the roots are feeding the wine or via versa. The vine roots seem to be fleshy and more like animal than plant parts. We are accompanied by guards, and for some reason I and others jump into the wine, causing outrage. A fight breaks out.",Negative
"New Basketball Team  Basketball is being played at Armstrong High School. I'm there with some of my old teammates, and some of the new players. Coach Jackson is there. I am left with the new team and Coach Jackson, while the other guys went somewhere to scrimmage or play. I feel out of place. I'm not involved. I want Coach Jackson to incorporate me but at the same time I'm much older than the new team, and I feel out of place. Track runners are there practicing on the indoor track. My sister Ramona, college classmate Bernice Grovner, old teammate Ron Lind, high school classmate Mark Raden, and others are there. I'm in a different gymnasium area where a young man is practicing running the 400. He is the only person there. He has a camera that is set up to take a photograph of him as he completes the run, to time him. I run on the track a bit to warm up. I'm pretty stiff, and out of shape. I get two Polaroid photographs of Ramona and I when I run.",Negative
"Now I was in a gardening store and I was looking at flowers, flower bulbs, potting soil, fertilizer and such. Now it seems that it's a drug store that is selling these things. They had what we used to call dump tables in the retail stores where I used to work. They were shaped like a box so you didn't have to worry about things falling off or getting knocked off. They had flowers in these tables. I touched one of them to see if they were real but they were silk. I decided to come home.",Negative

"I was doing something for SAID. I'm not sure where I was. There were other people I was working with but I don't know who they were. [I'm fairly sure that I knew them in the dream, but don't know if they were people who are familiar to me in waking life.] Occasionally I was in an office that reminds me of the BCC corporate office. Several times, I had to take paperwork to a specific department. After the second time, I remembered a different way to get to that department where I wouldn't have to walk by so many people, or so many of the same people. Once when I went the different way I saw Whitney P. Someone people had been talking about chocolate. She said something about having the good stuff, and pulled out the kind of box that we get from Arthur F. She broke a piece off the corner and began eating it. There was also something about transporting ourselves from one place to another, but not in any real way. It was more like something you see in a sci-fi movie or television program. It seems kind of like walking through walls, but we wouldn't end up in just the next room, but in a totally different place. If you did this in a sci-fi movie, you would end up in a different dimension or different planet, but this more like a faster way to get around here.",Positive
"Armstrong Relived  I'm at Armstrong High School. It's the end of the '95-'96 school year. I feel out of place and unaccepted; ignored. I'm with my friend Nate Nelling. We're walking down the main hallway. We see Mr. Olson, Mr. Kluball, and Mr. Hacker, all teachers. We near the office. There are ten photographs on the wall. There is some kind of contest to put names with the faces in the photographs. People I know from high school are there, including Chris Pattison, Dave Butcher, and my basketball teammate Shawn Salzburg. My friend Kevin is there doing his usual attention-getting routine; something to do with a cake. I walk by the lunchroom area. I have a limp. I can't walk. It's like my ankle is rolled over, or one leg is longer than the other. I try to walk normal. I know that I'm older than everyone else, and am self-conscious of this. I don't really fit in. As I walk, I lick my fingers. There is something sweet and sticky on them. I get down towards the lockers. A classmate named Mike Smith is there. He is talking about a football scholarship.",Negative
"Goldfish Rain Coat  I'm looking at a rack of t-shirts with a man. There are a lot of white shirts with different colored Nike logos on them. The shirts cost $10, which I think is too much. There is a red shirt with Michael Jordan and Spike Lee on it, and a wife beater with a huge amount of space around the collar. The man I'm with, who is a friend, tells me I should get a shirt like this, and he holds up a Goldfish (tiny crackers) shirt that is clear/whitish plastic, like a rain coat. I tell him I've already got one.",Positive
"I fell asleep again thinking of the nice dream I had had and I dreamed something different. I dreamed that I and my family were in a strange country. A cousin of mine, who is 22 and who went to Bolivia with us last year, was also there. Anyway, we were lodged in some kind of horrible apartment. It was dirty and we cleaned it with water. There was even blood and it didn't come out. We decided to leave that and return to our country. Coming out of that, we had to go through a labyrinth of dead-end streets, which were dirty and stank (my father, mother, siblings and cousin). We were able to get out of that horrible city and we started to go towards the frontier. Once there (we were in a car), they wouldn't let us through without going through a great deal of red tape that my father had overlooked. At any rate, we had to turn around halfway there and it was nighttime and it was in the country and the road was very narrow. My father suggested that we hide underneath the seats so that if anyone went by, they would only see two people, but one of them was fat. I don't know who she was, but there she was and it was difficult to get her under the seat. We arrived at the border and when we had almost gone through, they stopped us again so that my father would pay a certain sum of money. Then I got furious and jumped out of the car to scream at them and hit these men who were seated behind a table, like judges. They didn't wear uniforms. They were rather old men. I even wanted to hit one of them, and at that moment my dream ended.",Negative
"I was at Mom's. There were cops at the door and Mom was telling me to be quiet. I went to my room. Darren was using the lawnmower outside. My room was different and was lower than the ground outside and when I looked through the window I could see the grassed area clearly, but looking up. There was stuff all over the floor and I realized they were spider webs. They were everywhere and there were lots of little black spider eggs on my bed. I told Mom and she just kept telling me to be quiet. I got a tissue and fly spray and I had to squish them all because they would bite otherwise. I got a few and they would squirt out purple juice. Little Willy was playing. I went back to my room later and it was different. My computer was on and my bed was long (?). I yelled at Mom. I was then walking with Dad, Ezra and Mom to go somewhere. Dad mentioned his new place and I said ""what new place?"". He said ""the apartment"" and I said 'I thought you would've talked to me about me, what if I wanted to move back' etc. He said it was to avoid tax or something. We went to a petrol station and this cop talked to Mom and she thought I called them. Then Dad took me to this place called Connections, which I thought was a restaurant. I remembered people saying that it had a strict dress code and I said that I wasn't going to get in. Michael Cera was at the other end of the place with a friend, who was underage. They said something, but I can't read what it says apart from a small section which says ""dress as a girl"". They left. Michael Cera came back with a fancy towel thing and chains and jewelry on his neck. He was then with Ezra and this other guy with a towel around him. The guy checking ID's and such was watching them and so they decided to go in together. The guy let me in without checking my ID. I thought it was weird. There was a young girl with Calvin and they turned her away. Inside there were arcade games everywhere. There were tarot card ones, Pokemon ones, slots etc. When time ran out, the screen showed a cabin and everyone would get in and a bear would come. There was a drawing on an air hockey table, which included a tall gargoyle? Someone had to write ""be a [something that looks like writer]"", but it wasn't neat writing.",Negative
"There were pictures of famous people and I had to write down their names. Kit Harington and a guy I didn't recognise were there. I wrote 'Kit AWESOME Harington'.

"I was with my dad and Uncle John. My uncle went up to my dad and punched him into the stomach. He felt it, I could see. My dad backed up, then walked up to my uncle and gave him a vicious punch into his stomach, then backed up. Now I could see they were going to fight. They started to walk towards each other, so I walked between them and stopped the fight. Later I was asleep. I got up and was going to go to the bathroom downstairs and I saw my dad sprawled on the stairway asleep. I was on the street and there was a piece of ice about 18 inches thick, about three feet wide and about ten feet long. It was frozen to the sidewalk. I got a long knife and cut thru the ice as though it was butter. I cut out round pieces that looked like barrels and then I ran the knife under the ice and loosened it from the sidewalk, then gave it a push and the ice slid on into the street and blocked it. I was driving my car and the traffic was quite complicated. I thought if I had my motor tuned up by Pontiac service or Esper's garage, it would run better than it does now. I threw a potato that was on fire. I had a tube from the gas tank that I carried to a filling station. It was a pipe like or supposed to be a gas tank. It was about two inches in diameter and had a balloon on one end like a gas tank about four inches in diameter and about 1 foot long. The overall of the pipe was about 4 ft. The gas station attendant put the gas nozzle on the pipe and filled it with gas.",Negative
"I was at home. The mail had just come and I received a letter and a postcard from my girlfriend (age 22) whom I hadn't heard from in two years. She said she was divorced and that she now lived in S--. On the letter and postcard were pictures of S--. One scene was of a village with mountains in the background. It was beautiful and the colors were gorgeous. My girlfriend and I were in the gas station getting fuel for the car. The station was on a hill. Suddenly the scene shifted and I was in a classroom. I sat down in a chair that had several coats on it. Again the scene changed. It was raining and I was reading the election headlines in the paper. Wallace's name was there, but all I remember was something about rain being mentioned. Interpretation Dreaming about my girlfriend was probably occasioned by my thinking of her and wondering how she is. The postcard from a foreign country probably is a symbol of my desire to travel.

"In the beginning of my dream, I was walking here at school, with one of my friends to my next class (math). The bell had just rung saying that lunch was over. I think me and my friend were talking, but I'm not sure. We were still walking to class when the bell rang, which meant we were late. We didn't seem scared or worried. One of us might have said, ""Oh, well, we're late."" I am not sure, but I think my friend said that. When we got to class, our math teacher handed us each a detention. We were standing at the back of the room. I said, ""I thought you have to be tardy two times to get a detention."" Either my teacher or my friend says, ""That's only for P.E."" ""Oh,"" I said. During math class I wrote on a piece of paper: 1) Not sure. 2) Tardy to math. I am not sure why I wrote this. I think it was for my mom to explain why I got the detention.",Negative
"I dreamt that I was taking some kind of a test and there were other people of my age. There was a teacher or professor who was giving this test and instead of having the test written out, it was coming over a PA system and we would write the answers down. The room that we were in was big like a hall and it had tables for many more students than were there. These PA systems were put all over the hall and the voice rang through the hall. As I can remember after the test we were marched out in single file and then driven to a barracks then we were locked in. That is all I can remember.",Negative

"At a restaurant which was seated more like an auditorium. As waiter brought a neighbor a rice and stew plate, I asked for some like it, though it was a peculiar choice for breakfast. He went on serving others, apologized to me for delay. At last he dished up my order but it slopped over and he set the dish up to drip over a tray. He remarked that some of the trays in the pile were too small. Finally I said I had to hurry. Either bring me mine or put it on another plate. Then I was leaving and having some difficulty retrieving my newspaper.",Positive
"I was at home trying to sleep. I closed and locked my door. I managed to fall asleep but woke up like 5 minutes later. Layla was sitting in my chair doing stuff and I said 'get out of my room!' and I slapped her back and pushed her out of my room, asking ""how did you get in here anyway?"". I ate a Mars Bar and then went back to sleep. Later, I had this little ball, which was like the TARDIS; if you opened it, it was bigger inside. I can't remember properly, but I went to the future. The other me didn't like me. She was with a group and they did something but I was never clear what. I was then in a car with some people and this cop friend of mine was driving and he stopped this guy who was walking down the street with a trolley, because he was pushing it the wrong way. I was then at a shop with Eugene, who was my boyfriend. We walked into this area and I had my arm around him and we switched so that we were holding hands. There was a book place getting set up. We had a dog with us. I asked if the shop was Myers and it was. We went into the shop that was actually open and we were walking around. I lost my phone and found it on the floor. We went to this section with beds and then we split up. I walked past this couple who were on a bed and he was masturbating her and she was making a movie of it. I was like 'ok...' and continued along. I left the shop and went to my cop friend. He said ""all you guys went in with 2 and only 1 of you came out alone"". He made us go in to look for Eugene. Then we rang his phone and we heard it ringing in the elevator shaft. Then it was Jared Padalecki down there and he was a bit younger. He was in a section under the elevator chained up. He was trying to break this weak bit of wire above him to get his phone (he was directly under the elevator). He had been captured by aliens. He broke a water pipe to get water. He was let out and he was talking to me about it. He said something about pregnancy and I said ""what did they do to you?!"" and he was like 'oh none of that, just ""scrambled my brains"",'. He said they carefully watched him while he ate. We had encountered these aliens before.",Negative
